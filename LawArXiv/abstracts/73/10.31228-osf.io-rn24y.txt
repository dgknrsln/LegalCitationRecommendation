An indirect tax imposed on a seller of a product assumes "shifting of tax burden" from the seller to the buyer, while the amount of burden each entity bears is said to be unknown before economic analysis.  Since taxation is a restriction on property rights, the amount of tax burden, or property appropriated by the government, should be definite.
