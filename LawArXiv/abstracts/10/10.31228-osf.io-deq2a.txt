SAIPAR Case Review: Vol. 1 : Iss. 2 , Article 7

The elegant, unanimous judgment, was delivered by Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng. Justice Mogoeng began his judgment by underscoring the fact that as a constitutional democracy, the South African government was a government “of the people, by the people and for the people”. He added that since constitutional democracies do not self-actualize, it was the responsibility of governmental institutions and structures to turn the aspirations of the people into a reality. Noting that fifty five million people cannot collectively govern the Republic, he acknowledged that governance “by the people” was a legal fiction, noting further that the impracticalities of collective governance compelled the people to assign governance functions to “servants” and “messengers” who, in the exercise of these functions, should have the welfare of all South Africans foremost in mind.
