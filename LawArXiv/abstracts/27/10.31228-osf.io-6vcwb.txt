The Dayton Peace Agreement (DPA) ended the war in
Bosnia-Herzegovina (B&H) and created a new constitutional order. The very first unique feature of DPA is its 10th Annex which provides one person (The High Representative of the International Community in B&H) with enormous powers (legislative, judicial, and executive) which is granted to him by
