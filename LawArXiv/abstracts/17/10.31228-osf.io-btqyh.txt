�Professionalism.� This is a word that will always be associated with Justice Carrico�not only because he was a consummate professional himself, but also because he was dedicated to assuring that all lawyers understood the full ethical, social, and behavioral implications of their role as lawyers. Under his leadership, Virginia became the first state to require all newly-admitted lawyers to take a day-long course in professionalism. It is a model that has been widely emulated around the country.
