The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 banned all discrimination
against immigrants on the basis of national origin, replacing the old
prejudicial quota system. President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Act and
said that “the harsh injustice” of the national-origins quota system had
been “abolished.”
