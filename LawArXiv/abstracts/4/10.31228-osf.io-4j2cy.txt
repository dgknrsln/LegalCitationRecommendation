Laws differ from one country to another in the European Union. When legal diversity is perceived as a problem, notably for the integration of the Internal Market, harmonisation is used as a tool to increase the similarity of legal rules. However, legal harmonisation in the EU can be a challenging task. Familiar arguments against legal harmonisation include the protection of national sovereignty, the preservation of legal cultures and the superiority of regulatory competition. These arguments have been studied extensively in the literature. This paper takes a novel approach by providing a perspective from the field of social psychology to further our understanding of the challenges of legal harmonisation in the EU. We adopt a case study method and focus on the specific area of European insolvency law to provide specific examples of how psychological biases have influenced the harmonisation process
