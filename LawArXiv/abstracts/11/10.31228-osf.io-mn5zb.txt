The Supreme Court's recent Sixth Amendment cases have garnered much attention for their potential impact on ineffective assistance of counsel claims asserted in the context of a criminal case.

The article concludes that the Court's departure from a trial-centered conception of the right to counsel, its willingness to articulate specific pre-trial duties of counsel and its more pragmatic approach towards enforcing the Sixth Amendment will help those seeking indigent defense reform to establish the likelihood of future injury, a necessary element of successful structural challenges.
