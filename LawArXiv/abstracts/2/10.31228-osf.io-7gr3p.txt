This essay argues that neocontractualism emerges at a historical shift from classical liberal (Lockean) understandings of right (as the distinction between free and slave labour, premised on the non-absolute or temporally-limited transference of right) and the expansive use of the calculus of moral risk that accompanied that understanding of right. Neocontractualism is here defined as the turn to unbreakable and/or obligatory contracts, in which (paraphrasing Pascal and Ewald) there is no choice whether to contract.
