David Erdos’ new book, European Data Protection, Regulation, Journalism and Traditional Publishers, is a rich, meticulous contribution to the study of data protection law and its complex interactions with the media and with freedom of expression and information. In a time when new-fangled tech giants and Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications suck up most of the available attention, the role of more traditional actors remains nonetheless pivotal, and risks being underappreciated. Thankfully, Erdos’ new book does a remarkably comprehensive job of mapping the state of play in this area, critiquing its ongoing challenges and uncertainties, and charting a way forward. It marks a first, promising entry in the new Oxford University Press series on Data Protection and Privacy Law.
