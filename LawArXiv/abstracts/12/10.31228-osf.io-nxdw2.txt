As of publication date, University of New South Wales Law Professor Graham Greenleaf’s Asian Data Privacy Laws: Trade and Human Rights Perspectives is the only comprehensive book available that examines and aggregates the privacy laws of countries across Asia. This is important because on an international level, Asian privacy law is relatively underdeveloped when compared with the privacy law of other regions including the Americas and Europe. 

With the rise of Asia as an economic and technological powerhouse, Asian privacy laws are becoming increasingly crucial to any serious study of international privacy law. Understanding the current status of privacy laws in Asia is also essential for any U.S. or international entity that seeks to influence or adapt to the future direction of privacy law both in Asia and, by extension, the world.
