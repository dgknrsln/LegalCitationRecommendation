Susan Crawford’s Captive Audience: The Telecom Industry and Monopoly Power in the New Gilded Age is a timely book on an industry whose rate of growth is only outpaced by its rate of change.

Crawford traces the concentration of monopoly power in telecommunications, using Comcast as the story’s main character. The book’s focus is the 2010 merger of Comcast and NBC Universal, which tied several strands of the industry together. Not only is the book a fascinating history of the rise of an industry, it doubles as a manual on how the administrative apparatus of government operates.

The book would benefit from a deeper exploration of the wireless market. However, without the same defining merger as in the cable industry (yet), using Comcast to drive the narrative is a reasonable and satisfying choice for readers of any level of familiarity with the topic.
