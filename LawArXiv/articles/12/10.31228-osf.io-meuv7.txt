OBAMA'S NATIONAL SECURITY EXCEPTIONALISM 
SUDHA SETTY* 
INTRODUCTION 
One of the premises of this symposium is that the Obama admin 
istration, in undertaking various executive actions that protect some 
of the vulnerable immigrant populations in the United States, is acting 
in a more rights-protective manner than Congress has explicitly au 
thorized. This Essay juxtaposes this perceived dynamic with policies 
in the counterterrorism and national security realm, areas in which the 
Obama administration has acted directly in contrast to its more rights 
protective stance taken in other areas. 
National security is arguably an exceptional context when com 
pared to other issues that touch on domestic and international law 
and policy, such as immigration. This Essay considers the exception 
alism of Obama administration national security policies, which have 
undercut civil and human rights in ways that disparately impact racial 
and religious minorities. Included in this analysis are the non-prose 
cution of those who endorsed torture of detainees, use of drones for 
targeted killings of citizens and noncitizens, invocations of the state 
secrets privilege, and use of immigration authorities to detain and re 
move those accused of having a connection with terrorist activity. 
The latter part of this Essay situates the Obama administration's 
national security policies in the context of this symposium's examina 
tion of the horizontal and vertical separation of powers. In doing so, 
this Essay concludes that the rule of law distortion at both the domes 
tic and international level is enabled by a pronounced lack of judicial 
engagement and review of most rights-denigrating national security

I. EXAMPLES OF NATIONAL SECURITY EXCEPTIONALISM 
The label of national security exceptionalism fits the Obama ad 
ministration in two ways: first, although the administration has actively 
sought to address and improve the protection of human rights and 
civil rights of racial minorities suffering disparate negative treatment 
in a variety of contexts, those moves toward rights protection gener 
ally do not extend to the realm of counterterrorism abuses. Notably, 
in the post-9/11  counterterrorism context, almost all of those who 
have suffered from violations of human  and civil rights are racial 
and/or religious minorities. 1 One of the justifications for this type of 
exceptionalism is based on the widespread view that national security 
is an area in which ordinary legal and constitutional constraints do not 
apply because of the strong deference that ought to be afforded to 
the president in foreign policy matters;2 related to this type of excep 
tionalism is the outsized perception of the threat of terrorism by politi 
cians and the public, which makes it difficult for the government to 
shift away from its exceptionalist footing. 3 The second mode of ex 
ceptionalism is predicated on the view that the United States plays an 
1.  By "rights protection" in the counterterrorism context, I mean those actions taken to 
protect, improve or expand the civil and human rights of those most negatively impacted by the 
U.S. government's post-September 11, 2001, counterterrorism policies. Although judges, schol 
ars, and lawyers can argue as to the efficacy and legality of such measures, within the United 
States, the disparate impact of post-September 11 counterterrorism laws and policies has been 
borne heavily by Muslims, Arabs, and people hailing from-or appearing to hail from-south 
Asia, the Middle East, and North Africa. See, e.g., David Cole, Enemy Aliens, 54 STAN. L. REV. 
953, 957 (2002) (couching the disparate treatment of counterterrorism policies as falling on Arab 
noncitizens); Gil Gott, The Devil We Know: Racial Subordination and National Security Law, 50 
VILL. L. REV. 1073, 1073 (2005) (analyzing how "liberal democratic systems might evolve ... to

Exercise of Plenary Power, 14 TEMP. POL. & CIV. RTS. L. REV. 389, 391-92 (2005) (defining

A.  Improving Rights Protection in Some Non-security Con 
texts 
Looking at almost seven years of his presidency, it is clear that 
President Obama has prioritized improving the government's footing 
on several human and civil rights issues, a number of which have fo 
cused on areas in which a racially disparate impact is obvious. For 
many of these areas, the Obama administration has undertaken its 
efforts unilaterally, despite a reluctant or sometimes contrary Con 
gress. Immigration is one of these contexts, but other examples re 
flect presidential efforts toward better protections for racial minorities 
as well. 5 In the context of voting rights, President Obama immediately 
pushed back against the Supreme Court's gutting of Section 5 of the 
Voting Rights Act of 1965 in its Shelby County v. Holder6 decision of 
2013, ordering the Justice Department to continue litigating voting 
rights cases aggressively and creatively while pushing Congress to 
that the risk of death from terrorism versus other causes is comparatively infinitesimal, yet gov 
ernment resources are not proportionately allocated); Nate Silver, Crunching the Risk Numbers, 
WAlL  ST.  J.  (Jan.  8,  2010),  http://www.wsj.com/arti 
cles/SB 1000142405274 8703481 004574 646963713065116 (same as Campos). 
4.  President Obama's 2014 commencement address at West Point embodied a variety 
of arguably complementary, arguably conflicting thoughts on the notion of American exception 
al ism. At one point, he noted, "I believe in American exceptionalism with every fiber of my being. 
But what makes us exceptional is not our ability to flout international norms and the rule of law, 
it is our willingness to affirm them through our actions." President Barack Obama, Commence 
ment Address at the United States Military Academy in West Point, N.Y. (May 28, 2014), in U.S. 
GOV'T PUBL'G OFFICE, DAILY COMPILATION OF PRESIDENTIAL DoCUMENTS, 2014, at 3, 7. At an 
other point, he offered that "America must always lead on the world stage. If we don't, no one 
else will," /d. at 3, and continued this theme with the following: 
The United States will use military force, unilaterally if necessary, when our core interests de 
mand it: when our people are threatened, when our livelihoods are at stake, when the security 
of our allies is in danger. In these circumstances, we still need to ask tough questions about 
whether our actions are proportional and effective and just. International opinion matters, but 
America should never ask permission to protect our people, our homeland, or our way of life. 
/d. 
5.  The following list of activities is meant to be selective, not exhaustive; further, if the 
scope of analysis were broadened to include issues for which racially disparate impact is not 
facially obvious, other unilateral rights-protective measures undertaken by the Obama admin 
istration could be considered, such as the broadening of workplace, health care, and marital tax 
filing protections for LGBTQ federal employees.

tences, 9 but has also exercised unilateral executive action to encour 
age those sentenced under the prior racially disparate sentencing 
framework to seek clemency, 10 and continued to use his clemency 
power to order the release of some of those convicts.11 With regard 
to unarmed racial minorities being harassed, abused, or killed by po 
lice, President Obama has spoken out forcefully, moved toward the 
demilitarization of local police forces, 12 ordered better training and 
controls when federal military equipment is transferred to state and 
local police departments, 13 emphasized the need to improve commu

actions. 
B.  Security Contexts with a Mixed Record of Rights 
Protection 
In response to human and civil rights abuses occurring during the 
George W. Bush administration as a result of national security and 
counterterrorism programs, President Obama initially promised16 sub 
stantial shifts in policy to better protect rights. 17 Although the lofty 
goals he set forth on the campaign trail in 2008 and early in his ad 
ministration in 2009 have largely not been met, he has taken some 
steps to better protect human and civil rights in some areas. Well 
known examples include his issuance of executive orders in early 
2009 to end the use of torture on detainees18 and to close the deten 
tion facility at Guantc:mamo Bay, Cuba. 19 These moves toward im 
proved rights protection were laudable, but were tempered by other

17.  The need to increase rights protections in the national security context operates from 
the premise that such changes are necessary to comport with the rule of law and human rights 
law and norms. Many thoughtful scholars have argued that the current structures in place with 
regard to security policies, such as the use of drones for targeted killing, have achieved a posi 
tive, if not ideal, balance of individual rights and security imperatives. See, e.g., Robert M. 
Chesney, Who May Be Killed? Anwar ai-Awlaki as a Case Study in the International Legal Reg 
ulation  of  Lethal  Force,  13  YEARBOOK  INT'L  HUMANITARIAN  L.  3  (2010),  http://pa

policies or aspects of the administration's decision making. In rare in 
stances, the Obama administration has paid compensation to individ 
uals  who  were  abused  in  some  way  due  to  national  security 
overzealousness during the Bush administration, 20 but this has been 
more of an exception than the general practice of the administration, 
which has been to use a variety of tactics to seek dismissal of lawsuits 
seeking recompense for national security abuses and to cover up 
abuses when p0ssible.21 
For example, despite President Obama's statement affirming the 
illegality of torture, a continuing United Nations investigation into U.S. 
torture,2 2 and ample evidence made public by the Senate that torture 
was committed by U.S. government agents under the George W. 
Bush administration, 23 the Obama administration has made no moves 
toward seeking accountability for those who authorized, supervised, 
ordered, or carried out the torture. This is particularly noteworthy in 
the context of this symposium, which considers whether and the ex 
tent to which the Obama administration has gone above and beyond 
congressional authorization in granting protections and rights to cer 
tain immigrants; in the case of torture, we see not only a lack of ac 
countability over the responsible individuals,  but also a years-long 
fight by the Obama administration to keep the detailed findings of the 
Senate Select Committee on Intelligence secret and out of public

20.  In early 2015, the Obama administration settled a lawsuit with Abdullah ai-Kidd, who 
had been detained for sixteen days in 2003 under the federal material witness statute based on 
gross misrepresentations made by a federal agent on his warrant for detention. As a result of 
the settlement, ai-Kidd was paid $385,000 and was issued an apology by the government. See

22.  The United States has followed up its periodic reports to the UN Committee Against 
Torture with testimony as to how U.S. policies have changed such that torture is no longer 
committed in the name of national security, but has not gone further in promising accountability 
over prior acts of torture. See Tom Malinowski, Assistant Sec'y, State for Democracy, Human 
Rights and Labor, U.S. Dep't of State, Opening Statement before the United Nations Committee 
Against  Torture  (Nov.  12,  2014),  on  U.S.  MISSION  GENEVA,  https://geneva.usmis

view. 24  Where the  Senate acted forcefully to detail human  rights 
abuses, the administration continues to remain conspicuously silent 
as to its obligation to hold perpetrators accountable. Statements de 
nouncing torture and promises that this administration will not use 
such tactics on detainees are better than the Bush administration's 
actions, but they remain insufficient and the failure to prosecute seri 
ous allegations of torture remains in violation of the United States' 
international obligations. 
Another example of the Obama administration's marginal shifts 
towards rights protection is its movement of some cases from military 
commissions to Article Ill courts under the theory that federal courts 
are an effective venue for prosecutors to secure convictions, and they 
obviate the rule of law concerns concomitant with the use of special 
ized military commissions for terrorist acts.25 Using Article Ill courts 
as opposed to military commissions is  a shift that moves toward 
greater rights protection for those on trial, but the reality also includes 
the fact that federal prosecutors  of terrorism acts have the deck 
stacked in their favor in terms of being able to suspend Miranda rights

[T]hose who claim that our federal courts are incapable of handling terrorism cases are not

attempting to limit the use of these courts would weaken our ability to incapacitate and to punish 
those who target our people and attempt to terrorize our communities. Throughout history, our 
federal courts have proven to be an unparalleled instrument for bringing terrorists to justice. 
They have enabled us to convict scores of people of terrorism-related offenses since September

spite these significant limitations, some argument can be made that 
the Obama administration has shifted at least marginally in a rights 
protective direction on these matters; the same cannot be said for a 
number of other national security contexts. 
C.  Security Contexts in Which Exceptionalism Is at its 
Highest 
Numerous contexts exist in which the Obama administration has 
either actively undermined attempts at accountability over human and 
civil rights abuses committed under the auspices of a national security 
or counterterrorism program, or has kept secret the arguably abusive 
programs in order to shield them from accountability. In this section, 
three such contexts are discussed:29 (1) the use of unmanned aerial

Department policy came under public scrutiny in conjunction with the interrogation of the 2013

longed period of time before being read his Miranda rights. See Charlie Savage, Debate Over

29.  These three contexts are by no means inclusive of all of the ways in which the Obama 
administration's counterterrorism activities have had a disparate negative impact on people who 
are Muslim, or Arab or South Asian descent, or those perceived to fall into one of those catego 
ries. See Sudha Setty, Country Report on Counterterrorism: United States of America, 62 AM.

vehicles (UAVs or drones) for targeted killings, (2) the invocation of 
the state secrets privilege to seek dismissal of civil lawsuits involving 
sensitive government information, and (3) the use of immigration law 
to detain and remove noncitizens accused of a connection to terrorist 
activity. Each of these embodies at least one aspect of the national 
security exceptionalism identified above: that the type of authority 
claimed by the president is appropriate because it is within his unilat 
eral purview, that terrorism poses an exceptional and unacceptable 
threat to the United States that must be countered forcefully, and that 
the United States must play an exceptional role within the counterter 
rorism sphere and this role may justify excessive behavior in some 
instances. 
1. Drones 
President Obama expanded the use of drones for targeted kill 
ings30 of suspected terrorists during his administration. 31 Administra 
tion officials have repeatedly emphasized the necessity, efficacy, and 
legality of targeted killings as a counterterrorism tool, 32 and have re 
sisted the idea that other branches of government should play a sig 
nificant role over the question of who is killed by drones (citizen vs. 
noncitizen) and under what circumstances. Nonetheless, the program 
has prompted much debate over the basic question of whether such 
a program ought to exist, 33 the moral calculus of extrajudicial killings 
by remote control, 34 the legal parameters and authorities for such a 
30.  Although targeted killing is not defined under international law, it is often considered to

stating that U.S. citizenship is no protection against being targeted for

significant comfort: first, in 2013, President Obama announced a plan 
to curtail sharply the use of signature strikes52 in Yemen and instead 
use drone strikes only for those individuals targeted by the admin

many civilians had been killed by drone strikes. 55 However, in the first 
half of 2015, the administration had used signature strikes in Yemen 
at least twelve times. 56 Second, in 2013, then-Attorney General Eric 
Holder conceded to Senator Rand Paul that the president does not 
have the authority to use a weaponized drone to kill an American not 
engaged in combat on American soil, 57 apparently leaving open the 
possibility of noncitizens being killed anywhere, U.S. citizens being 
killed outside of the United States, and U.S. citizens being killed within 
the United States if the administration believes that they are engaged 
in "combat." 
Given the boundless geographic scope and lengthy predicted du 
ration of this conflict, alongside the administration's robust defense of 
both the effectiveness and legality of the program, it would seem that 
instituting proper accountability measures-by Congress and/or the 
judiciary-would be essential to protect against and provide redress 
for arbitrary or abusive decision-making in the process of extra-judi 
cial killings. Yet this area persists as one in which national security 
exceptionalism has prevailed. Congress has expressed little will in 
setting meaningful parameters on the program, 58 and the judiciary 
has shied away from adjudicating the legality of placing targets for 
extrajudicial killings on a government list, even if those targets are 
U.S. citizens who are not "imminently" attacking the United States in 
any conventional sense of the word. 59  Actual  protection  of  rights

2. State Secrets Privilege 
Focus on invocations of the state secrets privilege ramped up 
during President Bush's second term with the emergence of a pattern 
of the administration seeking dismissals of lawsuits during the plead 
ings stage, even when the suits dealt with allegations of extraordinary 
rendition, unlawful detention and torture, and the suits were the last 
attempts of gravely injured individuals to vindicate their rights. 61  De 
spite substantial evidence that citizens of Germany62 and the United 
Kingdom, 63 among others, were rendered by the United States gov 
ernment to other nations and were subsequently abused by the secu 
rity forces in the nations to which they were rendered, their civil suits 
have  been  dismissed  on  state  secrets  grounds. 64  Congress  dis 
cussed reining in the executive's increasing reliance on the state se 
crets privilege as a means of escaping the possibility of accountability 
several times: it debated the State Secrets Protection Act of 200865 
and  reintroduced  nearly  identical  reform  legislation  in  February 
60.  Leaking of government information continues to be the primary method by which the 
media, the public and Congress has been able to prompt further government disclosures about 
the drone program. In October, 2015, the Intercept media organization used leaked information 
to report on numerous aspects of the U.S. targeted killing program.  See The Drone Papers, 
INTERCEPT, https:/ltheintercept.com/drone-papers (last visited Oct. 24, 2015). As of this writing, 
the U.S. government has not issued a response.

200966 after the Obama administration appeared to adopt the Bush 
administration's stance in favor of a broad invocation and application 
of the privilege. 67 
Legislative reform efforts lost momentum after the Obama admin 
istration released a new policy for the Department of Justice in Sep 
tember 2009 that mandated a more rigorous internal administrative 
review prior to invoking the state secrets privilege. 68 That policy has 
been in effect for six years, but it appears that the internal review pro 
cess has resulted in little visible difference between the Bush and 
Obama administrations with regard to the invocation of the privilege 
at the pleadings stage in cases that often allege serious constitutional 
violations and human rights abuses. 69  More rigorous due process 
within the executive branch may indeed be more rights-protective, but 
because such evaluations have been kept secret and Congress and 
the public are not privy to that information, it appears that the Obama 
administration has adopted the "just trust us" view of due process that 
in some respects mirrors the actions of the Bush administration. 70 
Further, any future administration could easily undo any rights-protec 
tive due process measures that do exist, since the current process 
was not undertaken legislatively and does not engage Congress or 
the judiciary in a meaningful way.

Obama administration has suppressed the ability of individuals to liti 
gate their rights and hold government actors accountable for their 
past abuses. Further, a variety of political and structural incentives 
have created a situation where exceptionalism reigns and accounta 
bility from Congress or the courts does not exist: ideological alignment 
with the president, concern that national security is an issue within the 
president's sole jurisdiction, complacency, and an overly formalistic 
judiciary that chooses to defer to the president instead of engaging in 
its counter majoritarian obligation to protect fundamental rights 71 have 
all contributed to the lack of engagement on the question of redress 
for violations of human and civil rights. 
3. Use of Immigration Law in the National Security Context 
The government has, to some extent, conflated immigration and 
counterterrorism programs and has encouraged use of the immigra 
tion system as an important tool in counterterrorism efforts. 72 The re 
sult has been a system that, although legal under U.S. domestic law, 73 
arguably violates international law and norms with regard to the treat 
ment of migrants, 74 and most certainly is not rights-protective of the 
noncitizens caught in its framework. Juxtaposed against the unilateral 
executive action that has attempted to offer additional protection to 
some immigrant populations that is the subject of other articles in this 
symposium, the administration has leveraged the lowered due pro 
cess protections afforded to immigrants to conduct heightened sur 
veillance, engage  in racial and religious profiling,  and detain  and 
remove immigrants on a sometimes specious basis. 
The government is authorized to detain any person for whom it 
has certified that reasonable grounds exist to believe that the person

has engaged in espionage, 75 opposition by violence, 76 or terrorist ac

activity. 78 Since September 11, 2001, the federal government has re 
lied heavily on immigration law and policy to detain, interrogate, con 
trol  and  remove  suspected  terrorists. 79  With  fewer  checks  and 
balances, it is much easier for the government to arrest, detain, and 
investigate an individual under immigration law than criminal law. Un 
like the U.S. criminal justice system, where defendants have the right 
to an attorney, the right to a speedy trial, and the presumption of in 
nocence until guilt is proven beyond a reasonable doubt, immigration 
law does not afford detainees ample protections.  For example,  a 
noncitizen is permitted to have an attorney in immigration proceed 
ings, but counsel is not provided for the 80% of detainees in removal 
° 
proceedings who are indigent. 8 Furthermore, a noncitizen can be 
mandatorily detained for months or years before being released or 
removed from the United States, and the standard for removal is that 
of "clear and convincing evidence," a much lower standard than the 
criminal justice conviction standard of beyond a reasonable doubt. 81 
These lesser protections have allowed federal officials to under 
take several initiatives that have targeted immigrants, primarily those 
from Muslim-majority countries, in the name of national security. Mus-

heightened surveillance and arguably unconstitutional racial profil

challenging the government's case for removal due to the lower re 
moval standard of "clear and convincing evidence" as well as the in 
ability to access and challenge the secret evidence presented and 
alleged by the government. 8s 
Additionally, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)'s police 
powers have generated a high level of scrutiny and surveillance of 
immigrant populations within the United States. The lowered due pro 
cess protections accorded to immigrants allow for a more searching 
and less privacy-protective approach. Lawyers cite the presence of 
FBI agents during immigration proceedings, Immigration and Custom 
Enforcement's reliance on statements made in old FBI interviews in 
its decisions, and the FBI's submission of prejudicial affidavits raising 
national security concerns without providing the basis of the allega 
tions. FBI agents have used the structural power imbalances inherent 
in the immigration processes to coerce Muslim immigrants into be 
coming informants, or retaliate if they refuse.86

be an exceptional context, the focus here should be on the compelling 
problem of a lack of accountability over the commission of human and 
civil rights abuses. Both legal and pragmatic problems arise by cate 
gorizing national security matters as being fundamentally separate 
from other areas in which the administration has worked to protect or 
improve human and civil rights. 
For example, the United States has long been party to interna 
tional treaties prohibiting torture and cruel, degrading, and inhuman 
treatment, as well as extra-judicial killing and the disparate treatment 
of individuals  based  on  race,  ethnicity,  and  religious  expression. 
Among them are the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 87 the 
Geneva Conventions, 88 the International Covenant on Civil and Polit 
ical Rights, 89 the American Convention on Human Rights, 90 and the 
Convention Against Torture. 91 On the domestic level, the Fifth, Eighth 
and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution have been in 
terpreted as prohibiting torture, 92 and various domestic laws codify 
the obligations in the Convention Against Torture: the federal Torture 
Statute,93 the Torture Victim Protection Act of 1991,94 the Alien Tort 
Claims Act, 95 and the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act 
of 1998.96 There are no loopholes in international and domestic law 
that allow for torture, even in times of emergency. Further, interna 
tional law demands that government-sanctioned torture must be in 
vestigated and prosecuted where found. The exceptionalism for the 
Bush administration was redefining the underlying acts so as to claim

that whatever techniques were being used by interrogators on detain 
ees did not constitute torture. 97 For the Obama administration, the ex 
ceptionalism was deciding that, despite international law obligations 
to the contrary, the administration would not conduct an investigation 
into Bush-era torture98  and ultimately would  not prosecute any of 
those involved.99 The administration has remained steadfast in this 
position despite the evidence made public through the Senate Torture 
Report, 100 and has aggressively sought dismissal of civil suits alleging 
torture, as described above. 
For targeted killings, the international legal standards are murk 
ier. The Obama administration's stated limits on the use of drones 
reflect a unilateralist legal interpretation of the applicable international 
and domestic legal constraints; as with much of the counterterrorism 
power that has aggregated in the executive branch since September 
2001, there is no venue for challenging the administration's legal po 
sition other than through public pressure.101 In his May 2013 speech,

dent and the military that detainees who were suspected members of AI Qaeda were not pro 
tected by international and domestic prohibitions against torture and, furthermore, that abuse of 
detainees would not constitute "torture" unless the interrogators intended to cause the type of 
pain associated with death or organ failure. See Memorandum from Jay S. Bybee, Asst. Att'y.

President Obama stated that he welcomed a conversation with Con 
gress about a potential drone court, but noted that, given the scope 
of executive power in the area of foreign policy and counterterrorism, 
such a court may not be constitutional. 102 Such a view provides little 
more than cold comfort to those seeking to protect the rights of citi 
zens and noncitizens being targeted for extrajudicial killings in the 
name of counterterrorism. 
For these contexts,  exceptionalism cannot be justified from a 
purely legal perspective,  so the fallback justification turns on prag 
matic concerns such as whether the administration thinks particular 
actions-like targeted  killings or the  non-prosecution  of those  in 
volved in torturing detainees-benefit U.S. security interests or make 
sense from the perspective of political viability. And in this respect, 
President Obama is unexceptional; many presidents have used these 
pragmatic, non-legal justifications for their national security actions. 
Perhaps the only thing exceptional about this situation is that Presi 
dent Obama had promised a return to a non-emergency footing for 
the government and a return of the primacy of the rule of law. 
CONCLUSION 
Some parts of President Obama's national security exceptional 
ism should not be surprising; he advertised as early as his first presi 
dential campaign that, if elected, he would send drones into Pakistan 
to target individuals there.103 Yet his shift on the issues identified here 
have created two problematic dynamics with regard to rights protec 
tion: first, President Obama's rhetoric about restoring the rule of law 
and curtailing the perceived abuses of executive power104 arguably 
could have translated into meaningful reform that differentiated the 
Obama administration from the Bush administration's approach on 
the exercise of unilateral executive power.105 But repeated invoca

surrounded many of the Obama administration's policies, combined 
with excessive deference from the judiciary106 and a lack of action in 
Congress on many of these matters, has essentially given a biparti 
san imprimatur to claims of extremely broad executive power, a lack 
of rights-protective action on behalf of those subject to unfair dispar 
ate impact by the government, and a lack of accountability for past 
abuses. 
Second, this exceptionalism has taken and continues to take a 
toll on the view of the United States in the international sphere. Even 
before he became president, Obama signaled the desire to reengage 
with the international community as a matter of legal compliance (e.g., 
outlawing  the  use  of  so-called  "enhanced  interrogation  tech 
niques"), 107 as good foreign policy (i.e., restoring America's moral au 
thority in the world)1os and as a matter of restoring the rule of law. 109 
At least since 2009, the U.S. government has looked to garner the 
support and loyalty of allied nations that were skeptical of Bush-era 
U.S. counterterrorism efforts perceived to be dismissive of the coun 
tries' own priorities and cultural norms.110 President Obama's signing 
of the executive orders outlawing torture and closing the Guantanamo 
Bay detention facility on his first day in office were meant as strong 
signals that the U.S. government was responding to concerns that the 
United States flouted its own human rights standards, disregarded the 
rule of law, and lacked sensitivity to Muslims around the world. These 
in which the Bush administration employed a unilateralist unitary executive theory of power with 
regard to national security).

changes have served not only moral interests, but the realpolitik in 
terests  of rebuilding  trust  and  loyalty from  traditionally-allied  na 
tions. 111 
But continued national security exceptionalism engenders a view 
of the United States as considering itself to be above international 
obligations to investigate and prosecute torturers and war criminals, 
and the view by the global community that the United States is willing 
to apply one standard for itself, and another for the rest of the world. 
As such, the exceptionalism not only poses real challenges in terms 
of law, morality and building useful relationships with allied nations, 
but it acts as a step backward for the creation of enforceable interna 
tional norms and standards, and a step backward in efforts to restore 
a balance in the rule of law when it comes to national security matters.
