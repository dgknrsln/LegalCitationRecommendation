PACIFIC PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT AND INVESTMENT 
IN DEVELOPING NATIONS 
KRISTA L. COX* 
1. INTRODUCTION 
The  United  States  has  some  of  the  highest  standards  of 
intellectual  property  protection  in  the  world,  though  many 
copyright and patent laws in the United States are limited through 
balancing provisions that provide exceptions to the exclusive rights 
conferred by the intellectual property system.  The United States 
also  currently  has  robust  industries  that  rely  on  intellectual 
property  protection,  such  as  the  Pharmaceutical  Research 
Association of America (PhRMA), the Motion Pictures Association 
of  America  (MPAA)  or  the  Recording  Industry  Association  of 
America RIAA), and their value is often increased through higher 
standards.    It  is  one  of  the  few  net-exporters  of  intellectual 
property and, as a result, receives greater benefits from heightened 
intellectual  property  standards  than  do  countries  that  are  net-
importers of these goods.  While the United States has its own 
balance between intellectual property rights and the public interest 
in its domestic laws, often it seeks only to export the rights for 
rightholders without the corresponding limitations and exceptions. 
The United States has engaged in efforts to raise intellectual 
property standards worldwide through the creation of new global 
norms  such  as  through  negotiations  of  the  Trans-Pacific

Partnership Agreement (TPP).  One of the common arguments 
used in pushing for higher protections for intellectual property is 
that  such  standards  will  result  in  economic  growth  and 
development, either through burgeoning industries that rely on 
heightened  intellectual  property  protection  or  through  foreign 
direct  investment.1    However,  studies  have  shown  that  “rapid 
[economic]  growth  is  more  often  associated  with  weaker  IP 
protection.    In  technologically  advanced  developing  countries, 
there is some evidence that IP protection becomes important at a 
certain stage of development, but that stage is not until a country is 
well  into  the  category  of  upper  middle  income  developing 
countries.”2  According to another study, factors including “cost 
conditions, market size, levels of human capital and infrastructural 
development and broad macroeconomic conditions”, as well as 
deregulation, have been found to be more important to foreign 
direct  investment  than  the  levels  of  intellectual  property 
protection.3  In fact, countries like Brazil, China and India have 
seen high influxes of foreign direct investment, even with low 
levels of intellectual property protection.4

Higher levels of intellectual property protection may therefore 
be  unnecessary  to  attract  investment  in  developing  countries.  
Accepting these higher standards may not only be unnecessary in 
promoting investment, but can also result in negative impacts on 
development.  Higher protections for copyrighted and patented 
goods raise the price of culture, education, and medicines that can 
detrimentally  affect  developing  nations.5   Thus,  developing 
countries  carefully  weigh  the  risks  of  accepting  such  higher 
standards, particularly where they are unnecessary in promoting 
investment and development. 
2.  U.S. HISTORY:  RELIANCE ON FOREIGN INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY 
DURING DEVELOPING YEARS 
The  United  States  currently  has  very  high  standards  of 
intellectual property protection, though historically this was not 
always the case.  When the United States was still developing, it 
did not provide protection to foreign intellectual property owners. 
Instead,  the  United  States  encouraged  reliance  on  foreign 
works prior to the 1891 International Copyright Act.6  Recognition 
of foreign copyright in the United States, and increased intellectual 
property standards more generally, came not with the intention of 
attracting foreign direct investment, but rather because of external 
                                                      
and Eastern Europe . . . [rather than] China, Brazil, and other high-growth, large-
market developing economies with weak IPRs.’” (internal citations omitted)).

and internal pressures.  Domestically, it was seen as in the interest 
of  the  United  States  to  recognize  foreign  copyrights  as  local 
stakeholders  lobbied  for  strong  protections.    The  University  of 
California system and the University of Virginia, as well as Mark 
Twain, Louisa May Alcott and other prominent domestic authors, 
advocated for recognition of foreign copyright in order to ensure 
that their own copyrights would be recognized in foreign countries 
and that foreign works—which were often available at a fraction of 
the cost of domestic works—would not compete with their own 
works.7 
Similarly,  the  first  patent  act  only  provided  protection  to 
citizens of the United States and, later after amendments, those 
who had been residents for at least two years or those intending to 
become citizens.8  Not until 1836 did the United States remove the 
restrictions regarding nationality on patenting, though the 1836 
Act did charge nationals of other countries fees of ten to sixteen 
times higher than United States citizens and residents.9 
Although the United States, while it was in its own stages of 
developing,  provided  low  standards  of  intellectual  property 
protection and did not recognize foreign copyrights or patents, it 
now seeks to push these high standards on the rest of the world.  It 
has  done  so  through  a  variety  of  mechanisms,  perhaps  most 
notably its annual “Special 301” lists—a unilateral process where 
the Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) creates 
a “watch list” of countries that do not implement high standards of 
protection, even though they may fully comply with international 
obligations—and  through  the  negotiations  of  free  trade 
agreements.  Such efforts could be considered hypocritical and can 
slow the development of developing countries. 
3.  INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PROVISIONS IN THE TRANS-PACIFIC 
PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT 
Since 2010, the United States has been engaged in negotiations 
for a large regional trade agreement known as the Trans-Pacific

literary pirates, and American authors suffered the same fate abroad.”).

Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, Vietnam and the United

and the public has not been granted access to the negotiating texts 
or positions of the parties.12 
Although none  of  the negotiating  texts  have officially  been 
released, negotiating positions have come to light through various

provisions  reflecting  high  standards  of  intellectual  property 
protection  that  generally  provide  new  rights  to  rightholders, 
without adequate balancing provisions for the public interest.14

These  higher  standards  of  protection  proposed  by  the  United 
States include, inter alia, longer terms of protection for copyright, 
aggressive measures on “digital locks” or technological protection 
measures, patent term extensions, controversial measures to link 
patent status to drug registration, and high measures of damages.15 
Overall,  these  proposals  would  result  in  higher  costs  for 
copyrighted and patented goods.  In some areas of the intellectual 
property  text,  it  appears  that  the  United  States  proposals 
specifically  target  the  domestic  laws  or  intellectual  property 
practices of India16 or China,17 in an attempt to create new global 
norms that would isolate these countries. 
For  many  of  the  parties  to  the  negotiations,  particularly 
developing  nations,  the  United  States’  proposals,  if  accepted, 
would require changes to their domestic laws, impacting access to 
knowledge and access to medicines.  These proposed provisions 
often go well beyond international treaties and are not part of the

the known efficacy of that substance or the mere discovery of any new property or 
new use for a known substance or of the mere use of a known process, machine or

current legal regimes of many of the TPP parties.18  Why, then, 
would  developing  countries  like  Malaysia  and  Vietnam,  or 
wealthier  nations  with  smaller  markets  like  New  Zealand  and 
Brunei, agree to these higher standards that are likely to increases 
costs for education and make it more difficult to protect the public 
health? 
In an agreement like the TPP, the intellectual property chapter 
does not exist in a vacuum and consideration must be given to the 
over twenty other chapters.  Pressure to accept these proposals on 
intellectual property can arise in exchange for the United States, 
the country with the largest economic market, making concessions 
in other areas, such as better market access for dairy, sugar, rice or 
textiles—goods that other countries export.  Intellectual property 
simply is not a priority for many of the TPP negotiating parties, 
particularly in comparison to market access for their key exports. 
4.  BALANCING THE PUBLIC INTEREST:  PRESERVING FLEXIBILITIES 
All  countries,  but  particularly  developing  countries,  should 
carefully consider the effect that higher intellectual property rights 
protection will have on important public interest values such as 
education and the public health.  Although all negotiating parties 
are members of the World Trade Organization (WTO) Agreement 
on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) 
and therefore bound by minimum international standards, TRIPS 
provides  for  numerous  flexibilities  that  permit  members  to 
implement the agreement in various ways that take into account 
the public interest. 
One primary flexibility of the TRIPS Agreement lies in the fact 
that  many  terms  used  are  left  undefined,  thereby  allowing 
                                                      
18  Many of the aforementioned proposals have already been accepted by 
those countries with existing free trade agreements with the United States.  See 
generally, e.g., Free Trade Agreement, U.S.-Australia, ch. 17, Jan. 1, 2005, available at

countries to determine for themselves, according to their national 
context, how to interpret standards such as, for example, the terms 
used for establishing patentability  criteria  of  “new,” “inventive 
step,” and “capable of industrial application.”19  For example, such 
flexibility  permits  countries  to  set  higher  standards  for 
patentability,  among  other  areas.    The  initial  proposal  by  the 
United  States  in  February  2011  revealed  efforts  to  restrict  this 
flexibility by expressly defining such terms in a manner that would 
effectively lower patentability criteria.20 
Another critical flexibility expressly exists in Article 6 of the 
TRIPS Agreement, which notes that, “nothing in this Agreement 
shall be used to address the issue of the exhaustion of intellectual 
property rights.”21  This article permits each member to determine 
whether  to  implement  systems  of  national,  regional,  or 
international  exhaustion  of  goods.    Lower-income  countries  or 
those with smaller markets often prefer international exhaustion, 
in order to ensure that the country can import goods protected by 
intellectual property.22  Parallel importation can allow countries to 
access goods like books, movies, and medicines, often at more 
affordable  prices.    Sometimes,  goods  are  not  even  available  in 
certain markets.  These markets are ignored by right holders who 
choose not to invest, either because of the low-income status of the 
country or, in the case of certain high-income countries, because of 
the smaller size of their markets.23  The proposed text tabled by the 
United States in February 2011 included a provision that would

ban parallel importation of most copyrighted works.24  Subsequent 
to that proposal, the Supreme Court decided in Kirtsaeng v. John 
Wiley & Sons by a 6–3 margin that the United States implements a 
system  of  international  exhaustion  and  the  first  sale  of  a 
copyrighted good anywhere in the world exhausts the rights of the 
rightholder, thereby permitting parallel importation.25  This ruling, 
which settled a circuit split amongst the federal appellate courts, 
directly conflicted with the United States’ proposal in the TPP.  
Even several months after the Court’s ruling in March 2013, the 
United States’ proposal regarding parallel importation remained 
unchanged,  as  reflected  in  the  August  2013  text  leaked  by 
Wikileaks.26 
The  TRIPS  Agreement  also  permits  certain  exclusions  from

ordre  public  or  morality,”  as  well  as  specific  exclusions  for 
diagnostic,  therapeutic  and  surgical  methods,  and  plants  and 
animals.27   Again, the February 2011 text by the United States 
sought to limit these flexibilities.  For example, the initial proposal 
for the intellectual property chapter added the word “only” to the 
exclusion  of  that  which  is  necessary  to  protect  ordre  public  or 
morality, limiting this provision further than Article 27.2 of the 
TRIPS Agreement.28  The United States’ initial proposal also would 
reverse the explicit exception contained in Article 27.3 of the TRIPS 
Agreement, instead requiring the patenting of medical methods and 
plants and animals.29  The August 2013 text reflected some changes 
to the initial United States’ proposal, and Article 27.2 of TRIPS is 
replicated  in  the  agreed-to  text  of  the  TPP  without  the  word 
“only.”30  Furthermore, the United States modified its language 
regarding  patenting  of  diagnostic,  therapeutic  and  surgical

Another  key  flexibility  contained  in  the  TRIPS  Agreement 
exists in Article 31 governing compulsory licenses or “[o]ther [u]se

Agreement explicitly permits governments to allow the production 
of patented products even absent the consent of the rightholder.  
Each member to the TRIPS Agreement has the sovereign right to 
issue a compulsory license and determine the circumstances under 
which such a license may be granted.  In 2001, WTO members 
concluded  the  Doha  Declaration  on  TRIPS  and  Public  Health 
(“Doha Declaration”), a statement that largely confirmed the rights 
of members to protect the public health and definitively affirmed 
some  existing  flexibilities.33   Although  some  rightholders  and 
governments have tried to limit the Doha Declaration to a set of 
specific  diseases  or  cases  of  national  emergency,  including, 
arguably,  through  the  United  States’  initial  text  on  the  Doha

confirmed that a government does not need to limit issuance of a 
compulsory  license  to  emergencies:    “This  is  a  common 
misunderstanding.  The TRIPS Agreement does not specifically list 
the reasons that might be used to justify compulsory licensing.  
However,  the  Doha  Declaration  on  TRIPS  and  Public  Health 
confirms  that  countries  are  free  to  determine  the  grounds  for 
granting compulsory licences.”35 
The TRIPS Agreement also permits governments to address 
anti-competitive  behavior  and  abuses  of  intellectual  property 
rights.36   Both  the  United  States  and  Japan  have  opposed  a 
provision supported by the other ten TPP negotiating parties that 
would  permit  parties  to  address  “(a)  the  abuse  of  intellectual 
property  rights  by  right  holders  or  the  resort  to  practices  that 
unreasonably restrain trade or adversely affect the international 
transfer of technology; and (b) anticompetitive practices that may 
result from the abuse of intellectual property rights . . .”37 signaling 
the intention to limit this flexibility. 
While the above list of flexibilities is not exhaustive, it reflects 
some key areas where the United States has sought to change 
global  norms  and  limit  existing  flexibilities  under  international 
law.    These  flexibilities  provide  important  mechanisms  for 
countries to address abuses by rightholders and create intellectual 
property systems that take the public interest into account.  In 
order to protect serious public interest concerns including, inter 
alia, education and public health, negotiating partners in the TPP 
should preserve these TRIPS flexibilities. 
One  tactic  a  country  might  take  to  protect  the  public  with 
respect  to  intellectual  property  would  be  simply  to  point  to 
existing international standards and try to limit obligations to these 
minimum standards, such as those found in the TRIPS Agreement.  
Even  with  agreements  that  go  beyond  TRIPS  and  create  new 
rights,  such  as  the  World  Intellectual  Property  Organization 
(WIPO)  Copyright  Treaty  and  WIPO  Performances  and 
Phonograms Treaty, these international agreements tend to be less 
aggressive than the United States’ proposals in the TPP and permit 
greater flexibility in implementation.38  For example, the United 
                                                      
more affordable medicines for all.”).

measures and Internet service provider (ISP) liability are based on 
the  Digital  Millennium  Copyright  Act  (DMCA),  legislation  in

international obligations.39  Harm may therefore be mitigated by 
accepting the TRIPS-plus measures that exist in other international 
agreements and agreeing to ratify these treaties, but rejecting the 
specific provisions of the proposed TPP text that limit flexibilities 
or direct countries to implement treaties in a particular manner. 
Furthermore, although the intellectual property chapter may 
not be considered the most important chapter for many of the 
parties to the TPP, in large trade agreements with wide ranging 
levels of development, one might argue that greater leverage exists 
than in a bilateral trade agreement.  In a large scale agreement

support in many portions of the counterproposal, which largely 
reflected  the  standards  of  the  TRIPS  Agreement,  including 
explicitly preserving many TRIPS flexibilities.41 
Alternatively, however, an argument can be made that because 
the United States represents a disproportionate percentage of the 
economy  in  the  TPP—particularly  before  latecomer  parties, 
Canada, Mexico and Japan42—it “has more political and economic 
leverage over the other parties in the TPP” and “is able to rely 
more on its sheer economic and geopolitical strengths to push for 
provisions  that  are  in  the  interest  of  its  intellectual  property 
industries.”43  Furthermore, as discussed supra, the United States 
may offer concessions in other chapters in exchange for receiving 
support for its intellectual property provisions.44  Thus, the voting 
blocs  may  quickly  disintegrate  once  the  United  States  makes 
concessions in particular areas of concerns to countries that have 
opposed the United States’ proposals. 
Countries might also try to use current international will and 
trends  in  an  attempt  to  resist  the  United  States’  TRIPS-plus 
proposals.    In  June  2013,  for  example,  a  WIPO  diplomatic

countries  immediately  signed,  a  record  number  of  signatures 
during a WIPO treaty signing ceremony.46  Significantly, this treaty 
represented the first conclusion of a WIPO human rights treaty or 
agreement designed to primarily serve the interests of the users of 
intellectual  property  goods  rather  than  the  rightholder.    The 
Marrakesh Treaty created minimum standards for limitations and 
exceptions  to  copyright  rather  than  minimum  standards  for 
protection  of  copyright.    Currently,  WIPO  also  appears  to  be 
considering other treaties in the interest of users of intellectual 
property, such as one for libraries and one on education.47  TPP 
parties may try to leverage the international will in promoting the 
positive agenda and ensuring robust limitations and exceptions to 
intellectual property rights in the context of the trade agreement. 
5.  CONCLUSION 
The choice to institute higher levels of intellectual property 
protection, particularly without proper balancing mechanisms to 
protect the users, can detrimentally affect the public interest.  Even 
with the promise of foreign direct investment or greater market 
access to economies such as the United States, caution must be 
taken to ensure that certain TRIPS flexibilities are preserved so that 
these  countries  can  further  develop.    Furthermore,  and  as 
discussed  above,  foreign  direct  investment  is  often  more 
dependent on factors other than the levels of intellectual property 
protection  and  economies  such  as  India  or  China  are  seeing 
increased levels of investment, despite lower levels of protection. 
One  might  also  consider  what  the  important  trends  are  in 
intellectual property investment.  While certainly the traditional 
content industries remain viable investment choices, recent years

have seen the growth of “fair use” industries.48  These industries 
depend on or benefit from limitations and exceptions, most notably 
“fair use,” as a critical component to their business models rather 
than relying on the creation of higher levels of intellectual property 
protection.  Such industries may include manufacturers of certain 
consumer devices, programmers, software developers, educational 
institutions,  Internet  search  and  web-hosting  providers,  among 
others.  A 2011 study of fair use industries in the United States 
highlighted that these industries represent one-sixth of total GDP, 
amounting to $17.7 million.49  In 2008 and 2009, fair use industries 
reportedly “generated total revenue averaging $4.6 trillion, a 35 
percent increase over 2002 revenue of $3.4 trillion.”50  Exports for 
fair use industries increased sixty-four percent from 2002 to 2008.51  
Singapore, after amending its copyright law to expand fair use, 
saw  an  increase  in  annual  growth  for  its  private  copying 
industries.52  As these fair industries grow and contribute to an 
increasing percentage of a country’s GDP, it may be time to rethink 
whether continually ratcheting up intellectual property protections 
will ultimately cause more harm than good, not only in terms of 
the public interest in accessing patented and copyrighted goods, 
but  also  with  respect  to  contributions  to  the  economy  as  new 
technologies and industries arise.
