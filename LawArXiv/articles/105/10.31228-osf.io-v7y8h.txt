straight line according to least squares loss. The updates on HC-NJDG have improved a lot during the above chosen period
compared to the full duration of data collection. For many high courts we had to do discard the data collected during the

Orissa, Sikkim, Tripura and Uttarakhand. To emphasize, the frames of the plot of all these high courts have been made thicker
