CRIME AND PUNISHMENT: ASSESSING DETERRENCE
THEORY IN THE CONTEXT OF SOMALI PIRACY
YVONNE M. DUTTON*
I. INTRODUCTION
Deterrence theory predicts that the credible threat of punish-
ment  from  a  well-enforced  criminal  justice  system  will  reduce
crime: it will dissuade individuals from becoming criminals in the
first place or from continuing with a life of crime.1 Indeed, one
primary justification for creating and maintaining both national
and  international  justice  systems  is  the  belief  that  they  deter
crime.2 Individuals should view crime as costly because it brings
the potential for punishment in the form of a public arrest, prose-
cution,  and  sentence.  If  the  potential  for  punishment  is  suffi-
ciently  certain  and  severe,  the  hoped-for  result  is  that  rational

individuals will conclude that “crime does not pay.” They should
conclude that the costs of criminal behavior outweigh its benefits.3
Nevertheless, how does this theory apply to Somali pirates—
criminals who since the mid-2000s have been hijacking ships and
holding innocent crew members hostage until they are paid a hefty
ransom?4 This Article specifically examines deterrence theory in
the context of Somali piracy to contribute to the ongoing and
vibrant discussion about how to “solve” the global threat posed by
Somali pirates.5 In doing so, it shows that Somali pirates are for
the most part rational actors who could be positively influenced by
a credible threat of punishment to eschew a life of crime.
Thus far, however, any such credible threat to rigorously and
regularly prosecute acts of maritime piracy has been largely absent.
The international community has spent billions of dollars on naval
patrols that roam the waters off the Somali coast to help protect
ships from being attacked.6 Although those navies have been suc-
cessful  in  thwarting  a  number  of  attacks,  they  have  tended  to
release the pirates they capture rather than to transfer them for
prosecution.7 According to a report by Jack Lang, Special Adviser
on Legal Issues Related to Piracy off the Coast of Somalia (Lang

2014] Crime & Punishment: Deterring Somali Piracy 609
Report), by 2011, the international community was releasing more
than ninety percent of captured pirates.8 Therefore, the message
to pirates is that even when they are unfortunate enough to be
“caught in the act,” the most likely costs of their illegal activities are
those associated with having to seek out a new target.9 That mes-
sage could change if the international community were prepared
to prosecute a great majority of captured pirates.
This Article argues that increasing the threat of prosecutions is a
necessary component to solving the problem of maritime piracy
because the increased threat has the potential to deter Somali
piracy. The Article recognizes that Somali pirates may experience
certain “push” factors that increase the lure of piracy as a way to
earn a living. For example, Somalia is a poor country character-
ized by weak political and legal institutions in the areas where
piracy  is  most  prevalent.10  Neither  of  these  factors,  however,
detracts from the potential deterrent effect of a credible threat to
punish, rather than release, those who hijack ships and take hos-
tages for ransom.
First, even though Somalia is a poor country, evidence suggests
that Somali pirates are motivated by greed: they hijack ships to
obtain fast cars, big houses, and other riches.11 They choose piracy
as a career partly because the potential rewards are high, especially
considering the likelihood of prosecution if caught.12 In other
words, not every Somali is designed to be lured by piracy regardless
of the costs in order to put food on the table. In fact, other solu-
tions to the problem of maritime piracy fall short because they fail
to account for greed as a motivating factor. For example, strategies
aimed at containing piracy by thwarting attacks help protect inno-

9. Even in domestic jurisdictions, of course, not all criminals are captured and
brought to justice. However, it seems unlikely that, in any domestic jurisdiction, ninety
percent of captured criminals would not be prosecuted. Indeed, some evidence bears out
this intuition. See, e.g., U.S. DEP’T OF JUSTICE, EXEC. OFFICE FOR THE U.S. ATT’Y, UNITED
STATES ATTORNEYS’ ANNUAL STATISTICAL REPORT 7 (2011) (showing that in 2011, U.S. Attor-
neys’ offices had received 163,908 criminal referrals from law enforcement agencies, of
which they had declined a total of 25,102 for lack of sufficient evidence, among other
things—a fifteen percent declination rate); NYS DIV. CRIMINAL JUSTICE SERVS., NEW YORK

convictions).

cent seafarers, but they are unlikely to convince pirates to abandon
their quest for riches if accompanied only by the threat of losing
their weapons or skiffs.13 Strategies aimed at helping Somalia’s
youth learn skills to earn an honest living also have merit.14 How-
ever, the would-be pirates seeking riches will not be persuaded to
settle for the more modest wages they can earn from honest work
unless hijacking ships is accompanied by a greater threat of down-
side costs.
Second, for Somalia’s weak or corrupt institutions, increasing
the credible threat of sanctions through international prosecutions
of captured pirates can help neutralize this push factor. Through
prosecutions,  the  international  community  can  send  a  message
that some of Somalia’s own institutions may be currently unwilling
or unable to send: hijacking ships is worthy of moral condemna-
tion.15  If  pirates  heed  that  message,  then  the  institutions  in
Somalia that benefit from piracy should lose the opportunity to
extract bribes for protecting pirates.16 As a result, those institu-
tions also could be pushed in a different and better direction. This
is not to suggest abandoning the solutions aimed at instilling a
respect for the rule of law into the regions most affected by piracy
by  improving  the  function  of  local  institutions.17  Nevertheless,
changing entrenched policies and practices can be time consum-
ing and difficult, especially if some individuals overseeing those
policies and practices have a stake in maintaining the status quo of
piracy and the riches it can bring.18 Increasing the credible threat
of prosecutions could well complement any solutions that aim to
improve local institutions that could be used to fight piracy.

and how the desire for money and profits drives pirates to hijack
ships and hold innocent seafarers hostage until the pirates can
secure their huge ransom payments. Part III explains deterrence
theory and discusses some of its limitations relevant to whether
Somali pirates can be positively influenced by the credible threat of
a well-enforced legal sanctions regime. In Part IV, the Article spe-
cifically analyzes deterrence theory in the context of Somali piracy.
Part V concludes by recommending the international community
to commit to regularly prosecuting pirates and addresses some
objections to that proposed approach.
II. SOMALI PIRACY AND THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY’S
ANTIPIRACY EFFORTS
A. The Somali Pirates and the Rise of Their Lucrative
Illegal Enterprise
Maritime piracy has been around since ships took to the seas.19
The Somali coast itself has experienced intermittent and small-
scale pirate activity since the 1950s.20 Yet, Somali piracy began on a
grand scale only in the mid-2000s after a tsunami caused further
damage to the already destabilized country.21 The rise of piracy
thereafter  was  meteoric.  In  2002,  attacks  by  Somali  pirates
accounted for only 7.5 percent of the attacks reported worldwide;
by 2011, reports indicate that Somali pirates were responsible for
more than half of the world’s attacks.22 Pirate attacks were so fre-
quent that by 2009, one actual or attempted attack was reported
every twenty-nine hours.23 Between 2005 and 2012, Somali pirates
staged some 1068 attacks; held hostage at least 3741 seafarers of
125 different nationalities; and received upwards of $300 million in
ransom monies.24 The figures cited above should leave no doubt
why the media, the public, organizations, and the world’s leaders
came to view Somali piracy as a significant threat not only to the

world’s seafarers but also to the international community more
broadly.25
Yet who are the Somali pirates and why did they begin attacking
ships so frequently in the mid-2000s? Pirates like to claim that they
are  just  innocent  fishermen  who  turned  to  piracy  as  a  way  to
defend against foreign vessels that were illegally fishing and dump-
ing toxic waste in the country’s territorial waters.26 There is little
truth to this justification, however. It is true that Somalia has been
unable to fully protect its waters since being plagued by civil war
beginning in the 1990s.27 Some reports indicate that foreign ves-
sels  stole  more  than  $100  million  annually  in  seafood  from
Somalia’s waters in the early 2000s.28 Yet there is no actual proof
that links the phenomenon of Somali piracy to illegal fishing.29 As
Jay  Badahur  notes  in  his  journalistic  account  of  Somali  piracy,
although pirates like to use the excuse of illegal fishing to justify
their actions, they hijack for ransom almost exclusively the large
commercial vessels transporting cargo.30 Evidence supports that
finding—only  6.5  percent  of  Somali  pirate  attacks  have  been
against fishing vessels.31

In  other  words,  Somali  pirates  are  not  innocent  fishermen
attacking ships to send a political message.32 The reality is much
different. Somali piracy is a big business: it is carried out by well-
organized  pirate  gangs33  motivated  by  opportunity  and  profit.
Opportunity presents itself in a couple of ways. First, Somalia bor-
ders waters through which more than thirty thousand ships trans-
porting cargo from east to west pass each year.34 Second, Somalia
offers the potential for criminal enterprises to exist and thrive
because some areas are without effective local government and law
enforcement institutions.35 The profit motive is apparent from the
pirates’ preference for targeting the commercial ships willing to
pay hefty ransoms in exchange for the safe return of cargo and
crew.36 In 2011, the average ransom paid to pirates was about $5
million.37
Hefty ransoms lure those who organize and invest in piracy and
those who actually hijack the ships and watch over hostages. In
exchange for providing the equipment and start-up capital to fund
the pirate gangs who search for a viable target, kingpins and inves-
tors receive the greatest share of the ransom proceeds.38 The on-
the-water pirates—typically men of the ages between fifteen and

thirty with little education and few skills39—also receive a share.40
Those pirates can earn between $10,000 and $15,000 for participat-
ing in a successful attack41 and perhaps more than $50,000 in a
year.42 Some on-the-water pirates may earn even more for their
participation—up to $75,000 for their role in an attack.43 This is a
lot of money in a country plagued by poverty where individuals
face both low-employment prospects and low-earning potential.44
In fact, Somalia’s youth unemployment rate is sixty-seven percent,
and the median income is about $600 per year.45 With one success-
ful hijacking, however, the men who have chosen the life of a
pirate become rich.
Indeed, although poverty may be a factor helping to push some
men to choose piracy as a career, evidence also suggests they are
motivated by greed and the desire to become rich.46 As one report
based on focus groups conducted in Somalia concludes, for these
men,  “piracy  offers  the  possibility  of  getting  rich  quick  and
enjoying associated benefits of a more affluent lifestyle, marriage
and increased khat use.”47 Others offer a similar picture of the
“typical” pirate lured by easy money and its apparent rewards. Pres-
ident Abdirahman Mohamed Farole of Puntland48 states that the
pirates drive around in expensive cars, host lavish parties, and have

khat, alcohol, and sex workers or trafficked girls.50 Ordinary villag-
ers and some religious leaders are not necessarily pleased by the
pirate  lifestyle  characterized  by  “big  houses,  fast  cars,  and  easy
drugs.”51 Pirates, however, are not loath to brag about their “easy
money.”52 One successful nineteen-year-old pirate told a reporter
that he had gone from living on the street to owning a big house
and a large truck by participating in only two ship hijackings.53
B. Somali Piracy Methods and Tactics
Somali pirates prey on the huge amount of commercial shipping
that passes through the waters off their country’s coastline, includ-
ing the Gulf of Aden, a relatively constrained waterway close to
Somalia’s northern shore.54 Nevertheless, Somali pirates have also
demonstrated that they are capable of mounting attacks in the
Indian Ocean up to one thousand nautical miles out to sea.55 They
operate from “mother ships”—large fishing vessels that pirates typi-
cally acquire through other acts of piracy.56 The large and slow-
moving commercial vessels are often no match for the pirate teams
who approach on any number of high-speed maneuverable skiffs
powered with large outboard motors.57 In many instances, pirates
are able to board the ship and take hostages within fifteen to thirty

minutes of appearance.58 Armed with AK-47 rifles and rocket-pro-
pelled grenade launchers, Somali pirates have managed to success-
fully commandeer some of the world’s largest supertankers.59 As
of May 2012, Somali pirates had taken 3741 crew members hostage
from 125 countries.60 Reports also indicate that between eighty-
two  and  ninety-seven  seafarers  have  died  as  a  result  of  Somali
piracy,  either  during  attacks  or  during  captivity  with  poor
treatment.61
As noted above, Somali pirates employ a lucrative hijack-for-ran-
som business model for several reasons. First, the pirates do not
have a viable market to sell the ships’ cargo.62 Second, Somali
pirates also have the unique ability to anchor the hijacked ships in
safe harbors in lawless Somalia with financial support from govern-
ment officials, business people, clan elders, and members of local
communities, among others.63 The World Bank has pointed to
twenty-six different preferred anchoring points, with six of them
the most active.64 In these safe harbors, the pirates are able to hire
ground crews to protect the ship from rescue attempts or compet-
ing gangs.65 They supply each ground crew with water, food, and
khat during their service.66 The existence of these safe sanctuaries
allows Somali pirates to hold their hostages for a long period until
they can coerce ship owners to accede to their ransom demands.67
The pirates have been known to take their time during the ransom
negotiation process and hold hostages for as long as 1178 days.68

2014] Crime & Punishment: Deterring Somali Piracy 617
Finally, the potential for rich rewards is the overarching reason.
Somali pirates target the large commercial ships precisely because
their owners have the resources and incentive to pay huge ransoms
in exchange for the release of their cargo and crew.69 The average
ransom in 2011 was $5 million,70 but some ransom payments have
well exceeded that amount over the years. For example, in 2011,
Somali pirates received $13.5 million in exchange for the release of
the MV Irene, a supertanker carrying a twenty-five-member crew
and two million barrels of oil.71 Somali pirates also received about
$10 million in ransom to release a South Korean supertanker, the
Samho Dream.72
C. The Fight Against Somali Piracy: Defensive Measures
Ship owners and states have employed a variety of tactics to ward
off attacks by Somali pirates. As an initial matter, many ship own-
ers follow the maritime industry’s “best management practices.”73
These are a set of guidelines outlining a series of passive defensive
measures designed to make a ship less likely to fall prey to a pirate
attack.74 For instance, the guidelines encourage ships to install
alarms and closed circuit televisions so that they will be warned of
an imminent attack.75 They also warn ships to arm themselves with
nonlethal weapons such as high-power fire hoses and razor-wire
barriers to repel pirates from boarding the ship.76 In addition, the
guidelines emphasize the need for ships to register with interna-

tional  and  regional  monitoring  agencies  so  navies  or  other
counterpiracy teams are able to assist in the event of an attack.77
The  world’s  navies  also  have  been  patrolling  pirate-infested
waters  to  protect  ships  against  attacks.  Starting  in  2007,  some
countries began offering naval escorts to World Food Program
ships delivering humanitarian aid.78 In total, those naval escorts
have accompanied about 150 vessels carrying essential humanita-
rian assistance.79 By late 2008, countries also began contributing
naval resources to conduct general counterpiracy patrols.80 Mul-
tinational naval forces (Combined Task Forces 150, 151, and 152)
involving twenty-seven different states have been operating in the
Gulf of Aden, the Arabian Sea, and the Indian Ocean to disrupt
and suppress acts of piracy.81 These forces have been joined by
others, such as the E.U. combined naval force (Atalanta).82 The
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) also has sent ships on
antipiracy missions to the Horn of Africa.83 Other states, including
Russia, China, India, South Korea, Japan, Malaysia, and Singapore,
have  complemented  these  multinational  operations  by  sending
their own ships to patrol the waters off the Somali coast.84 In total,
between ten and sixteen naval ships conduct antipiracy missions in
the Gulf of Aden and the Indian Ocean on any given day85 at a cost
of more than $1 billion annually.86
Notwithstanding these antipiracy efforts, Somali pirate attacks
remained a constant threat to passing ships. The International
Maritime Bureau (IMB) Piracy Reporting Centre figures show that
worldwide  pirate  attacks  between  January  2007  and  December
2011 numbered 1850 in total.87 Attacks during 2009, 2010, and

2011 totaled more than 400 each year—exceeding by more than
half of the total reported attacks in 2007.88 These numbers do not
mean that passive defensive measures and the naval patrols had no
antipiracy  effect.  According  to  the  Lang  Report,  naval  forces
“thwarted 126 attacks in 2008, 176 in 2009 and 127 in 2010.”89 In
addition, the IMB credits the navies and the use of defensive mea-
sures with reducing the number of successful attacks Somali pirates
staged  during  2011.90  Nonetheless,  as  another  report  laments,
although the navies contributed to a decrease in the number of the
successful hijackings, they did not “contain the growth in the over-
all number of attacks and the area in which pirates can operate.”91
In fact, some commentators suggest that the vastness of the area
in which Somali pirates operate means naval patrols could never
keep  every  ship  safe.92  According  to  the  U.K.  Major  General
Howes (Operation Commander of Atalanta), about “83 [ships]
would be needed to provide response conditions of half an hour
. . . .”93 William Wechsler, the U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of
Defense for Counternarcotics and Global Threats, offers the more
pessimistic view that all the navies in the world could not protect
the approximately 2.9 million nautical miles in which pirates may
stage attacks.94 Because of budgetary pressures, however, there are
reasons to suspect that states may provide fewer naval resources in
the fight against piracy in upcoming years.95

protection.96 They pleaded for states to allow them to hire private
armed guards to accompany their crews as they travelled through
pirate-infested waters.97 By about mid-2011, many states heeded
these pleas and authorized the use of armed guards on board
ships.98 Ship owners also appear to have embraced the use of pri-
vate armed security in the fight against maritime piracy.99 Esti-
mates  indicate  that  the  percentage  of  ships  employing  armed
guards rose from approximately ten percent to fifty percent in
2011.100 Ship owners and operators spent more than $1 billion for
this private protection in 2012 alone.101
The good news is that since 2012 these various defensive tactics
employed by states and ship owners seem to have helped signifi-
cantly reduce the number of successful attacks.102 One often cited
anecdote is that no ship carrying armed personnel has been suc-
cessfully hijacked.103 Nevertheless, both the IMB and those who
have participated in the naval counterpiracy patrols warn against
complacency,  arguing  that  Somali  piracy  remains  a  significant
threat.104 According to one commentator, these recent gains are
“fragile and reversible,” particularly because the European Union

and NATO mandates expire at the end of 2014, and the cost of
hiring private armed guards is substantial and perhaps not sustain-
able.105 Furthermore, as one U.S. admiral who has commanded
naval patrols notes, Somali pirates have demonstrated their ability
to adapt to the various defensive measures employed—they began
operating further out to sea to avoid naval patrols and boarding
ships at night to avoid ships’ passive security measures.106 That
same admiral stresses that pirates are in the business of making
money and that they have found, and will continue to find, ways to
overcome the defensive measures that stand between them and a
successful hijacking.107
In sum, the fight against Somali piracy is not over. At present,
the various combined defensive tactics have proved successful in
the short term; Somali pirates staged fewer successful hijackings in
2012 than in either 2010 or 2011.108 At the same time, however,
the evidence suggests that they have not abandoned their quest for
the huge ransom payments that follow from a successful pirate
attack. According to Donna Hopkins, Chair of the U.N. Contact
Group on Piracy off the Coast of Somalia, pirates “still roam a huge
part of the Indian Ocean as well as the Red Sea and the Gulf of
Aden looking for vessels to hijack.”109 Recent news reports support
this conclusion. In May 2013, E.U. antipiracy naval forces found a
skiff 320 nautical miles off the Somali coast with six men and
equipment commonly related to piracy on board.110 In June 2013,
E.U. antipiracy naval forces rescued fourteen Indian sailors whose
cargo ship had been boarded by twelve armed pirates in the Gulf of
Aden.111

622 The Geo. Wash. Int’l L. Rev. [Vol. 46
D. The Fight Against Somali Piracy: Prosecutions
How has the world community thus far dealt with the pirates?
One answer is that the world’s navies release a great number of
Somali pirates without prosecution and thus have been accused of
following a “catch and release” policy.112 This means that pirates
can roam the seas and threaten ships, yet face little risk of being
held accountable for their crimes even if they are unfortunate
enough to be captured “in the act” by the world’s navies. Each of
the  Danish,  British,  Canadian,  and  U.S.  navies  reportedly  has
released suspected Somali pirates, including in situations where
they had evidence of illegal activities, all because no state would
agree to take them.113 According to the Lang Report, only about
one-third of the pirates captured between 2008 and 2010 were
prosecuted.114 The “release” rate worsened over time. By 2011,
“more  than  90  per  cent  of  the  pirates  apprehended  by  States
patrolling  the  seas  [were  to  be]  released  without  being  prose-
cuted.”115 Not surprisingly, the capturing navies identified some of
the  pirates  who  were  previously  apprehended  and  released  as
repeat offenders.116
Nevertheless, as of December 2012, some twenty-two states either
were holding for prosecution or had already tried approximately
1190 Somali pirates.117 These numbers, however, deserve a closer
look. First, twenty-two states are only a small portion of the states
that  are  authorized  to  exercise  jurisdiction  over  acts  of  piracy.
Piracy is a universal jurisdiction crime, meaning any state can pros-
ecute without nexus to the offense (for example, despite the fact
that none of its citizens was the victim of the attack).118 Addition-

Crime (UNODC), Kenya has conducted eighteen trials involving
147 suspects.125 Similarly, the Seychelles is processing fourteen
cases involving 118 suspects.126 Yet, as even these numbers indi-
cate, Kenya and other African states cannot prosecute all of the
pirates captured by patrolling navies. Moreover, as Lang noted,
some states will not want to bear the whole burden of prosecuting
pirates and likely will be more willing to do so if they see that West-
ern states are also prosecuting cases.127
In short, although some pirates are being prosecuted, evidence
also points to a culture of impunity whereby a great number of
alleged pirates have been able to escape justice. This culture of
impunity has reigned despite repeated calls to states to prosecute
more pirates. The U.N. Security Council, for instance, has empha-
sized that the failure to prosecute pirates undermines antipiracy
efforts and has accordingly called on states to criminalize piracy
under their national laws and favorably consider trying pirates in
their domestic courts.128 The Lang Report echoed the call for
increased prosecutions of pirates, noting that bringing captured
pirates  to  justice  is  a  crucial  component  of  an  effective

pirates captured by the world’s navies. See, e.g., Council Decision 2009/293/CFSP, Acts

counterpiracy  strategy.129  The  maritime  industry  similarly  has
argued that increasing the very low prosecution rate of captured
pirates would have an important deterrent effect and protect more
innocent seafarers from the risk of being held hostage.130
The remainder of this Article considers whether and under what
circumstances criminal sanctions can deter the kinds of individuals
who thus far have been drawn to the big money and lavish lifestyles
available to successful Somali pirates.
III. THE DETERRENT EFFECT OF CRIMINAL SANCTIONS
Deterrence theory predicts that the credible threat of punish-
ment—by way of an arrest, trial, and sentence—will convince indi-
viduals  not  to  commit  crimes.131  Both  specific  and  general
deterrence are goals of this well-enforced penalty regime.132 The
credible threat of sanctions should specifically deter those who
have violated the law and suffered a penalty from choosing to com-
mit future crimes. The threat should also generally deter individu-
als  from  turning  to  a  life  of  crime  to  avoid  the  likelihood  of
punishment.133
The theory does not, however, predict that even a perfectly for-
mulated legal-sanctions regime can deter all criminals or all crimi-
nal behaviors. In fact, even those who agree that a credible threat
of sanctions can deter some crimes argue that it may not deter cer-
tain criminals, such as those who commit crimes of passion.134

same report, the U.K. Foreign Affairs Committee considers objections by government
actors who argue that pirates were released because of the absence of sufficient evidence to
criminally convict them. Id. ¶ 81. Yet, the report also concludes as follows:
[N]ot all claims made by the Government about the difficulty in securing evi-
dence were wholly convincing: when pirates are observed in boats with guns, lad-
ders  and  even  hostages,  it  beggars  belief  that  they  cannot  be  prosecuted,
assuming that states have the necessary laws in place and the will to do so.

Others argue that the credible threat of sanctions can produce
only so much of a deterrent effect.135 For example, some commen-
tators argue that finely tuning the applicable penalties for particu-
lar  offenses  is  likely  a  wasted  effort.136  They  suggest  that
individuals will not know which precise penalties will apply for cer-
tain  acts;  thus,  there  is  no  likely  marginal  deterrent  effect  in
increasing penalties for some crimes.137 Proving empirically that
deterrence theory works is also a problem because it requires show-
ing that individuals who otherwise would have committed crimes
did not do so due to the threat of sanctions.138 Nevertheless, deter-
rence is a primary goal of any criminal justice system.139 Moreover,

does indeed act as a general deterrent and probably is responsible for some share” of the

there is a general consensus that “there likely is a deterrent effect
to the workings of the criminal justice system . . . .”140
Deterrence theory emerges from the law and economics litera-
ture, as opposed to, for example, the literature of criminologists.141
Criminologists focus on the individuality of would-be criminals and
the personal or environmental factors that might encourage a par-
ticular person to engage in crime.142 For instance, some individu-
als may be more likely to commit crimes because they have few job
prospects or are poor.143 Criminologists thus argue that policy
solutions aimed at deterring crime should be targeted and address
the unique circumstances that might lead a given individual or
group of individuals to commit crime.144 Instead of focusing only
on  legal-sanctions  regimes,  criminologists  might  suggest  that
policymakers improve educational opportunities or eliminate pov-
erty so that some individuals will have fewer push factors leading
them to view crime as beneficial.145
Economists advancing theories of deterrence, by contrast, argue
that a well-enforced legal-sanctions regime can help dissuade soci-
ety as a whole from committing crimes—even those individuals
who may have greater reasons to be lured by a life of crime.146
They proceed from the premise that all would-be criminals are self-
interested, rational actors, who are able to and do respond to the
potential costs and benefits of committing illegal acts.147 Rational
actors wish to maximize their utility and will choose the action that

will produce the greatest benefits over costs.148 Deterrence theory
also assumes that no one particular individual or set of individuals
is innately or specially compelled by virtue of some psychological
or other “flaw” to commit crime; rather, all people are presumed
both rational and capable of committing a crime when doing so
would maximize individual utility.149 Although each rational indi-
vidual may have some different and unique circumstances that will
inform his decision, deterrence theory still suggests the general
calculus remains the same: one will not commit a crime if the likely
costs of the action exceed the likely benefits one can reap from
it.150
In the cost-benefit calculation of engaging in a criminal activity,
an obvious benefit from most types of criminal activity is the oppor-
tunity to gain “easy money.”151 One can also imagine that, in some
cases, individuals may obtain psychological benefits from criminal
activity—for instance, the feeling of being able to “outsmart the
police” or the feeling of knowing one’s act has furthered some
political or other agenda. The cost side of the equation, however,
is the primary focus of deterrence theory. Deterrence theorists
argue that an increased threat of punishment from a well-enforced
criminal justice system will increase the cost of anticipated criminal
activity, thereby both generally and specifically deterring individu-
als from committing crimes.152
Scholars  typically  focus  on  two  principal  considerations  that
inform the calculation of costs associated with a well-enforced crim-
inal justice system: the certainty of punishment and its likely sever-
ity.153 Certainty of punishment refers to the likelihood that an
offender will be arrested and convicted.154 Severity of punishment
refers to the sanction’s punitive quality—for example, whether the
offense is punished by a fine, a prison term, or the death pen-
alty.155 The certainty and severity of potential punishment can be
observed objectively from data showing how likely it is that those
committing certain types of crimes are punished and the sentences

they receive. Yet many scholars argue that what should matter
most for deterrence theory are perceptions about punishment.156
In other words, even if the likely punishment is objectively certain
and severe, a rational individual has to know something about the
law and prescribed punishment in order to be deterred from com-
mitting crime.157
What specific limitations of deterrence theory are relevant to the
question of whether and under what circumstances criminal sanc-
tions are likely to deter Somali piracy? This Article explores two
such limitations below. First, deterrence theory assumes a rational
actor,  an  assumption  that  may  not  always  apply.158  Second,  as
other scholars have noted, the threat of formal legal sanctions may
be more likely to produce a deterrent effect, or a greater deterrent
effect, if legal sanctions are also accompanied by some potential
informal social sanctions.159
A. The Rational Actor Assumption
Deterrence theory assumes rational actors will adjust their behav-
ior because of the credible threat posed by a well-enforced legal-
sanctions regime. Nevertheless, not all actors are deterred by that
threat because not all are necessarily rational. As Professors Robin-
son and Daley suggest, there may be a “host of conditions that
interfere with the rational calculation of self-interest by potential
offenders . . . .”160
For instance, some individuals may be “irrational” in that they
have atypical risk profiles—they are willing to assume the risk of
paying high costs for their behavior. The suicide bomber is one
example of a type of criminals who is generally undeterred by the
threat of sanctions. Indeed, he is willing to die in order to carry
out his illegal activity.161 No doubt he also presumably perceives
that he and others of like mind will gain great benefits as a result of
his actions because he will further political goals by terrorizing
156. See, e.g., Pasternoster, supra note 1, at 780 (explaining the evolution of deterrence R
theory to account for perceptions of objective sanction threats).
157. See id.
158. Professors Robinson and Darley are two among many to raise this concern about
deterrence theory. See, e.g., Robinson & Darley, supra note 135, at 955–56. R
159. See, e.g., Ku & Nzelibe, supra note 153, at 792–96; Keenan, supra note 142, at R

161. See, e.g., Ku & Nzelibe, supra note 153, at 793 (referencing the suicide terrorist as R

some population. At the same time, the suicide bomber would
appear to be a person for whom the costs carry no weight. He
commits his criminal act even though the penalty for his action,
death, is both certain and severe.
Suicide bombers are not the only ones who demonstrate this
type of “irrational” response to the threat of sanctions. Some schol-
ars suggest that individuals who commit mass atrocities will be
undeterred by a legal-sanctions regime even if they perceive that
punishment is relatively certain.162 These actors may be irrational
because of the unique social context in which they operate—a soci-
ety where the state has helped manifest a community of hatred or
where the state is constantly experiencing civil warfare. Like the
suicide bomber, individuals in these circumstances may fanatically
believe that their violent acts are necessary to achieve a desired
aim, such as the elimination of all people of another clan or relig-
ion.163 In these types of cases, individuals may focus almost exclu-
sively on the “benefits” of their violent acts.164
B. The Role of Complementary Informal Social Sanctions
Deterrence theory focuses on how the criminal justice system
generally influences societal behavior on committing crimes. It
predicts that the threat of arrest and the potential additional pun-
ishment that may follow in the event of a conviction can dissuade a
rational individual from becoming a criminal. Scholars suggest,
however,  that  the  deterrent  effect  of  formal  legal  sanctions
increases when accompanied by the threat that the individual will
suffer informal social sanctions if his community learns of his crim-
inal  activities.165  For  example,  the  costs  associated  with  being
arrested are greater for individuals who function within a commu-

nity that may also shun them for being arrested—a community
where criminal activity is relatively rare and thus stigmatizing. In
such a community, in addition to facing jail time or other formal
sanctions, an arrested individual may lose friendships, job opportu-
nities, or social standing.166
A study by Professors Nagin and Klepper is helpful. They found
that middle-class individuals were willing to evade taxes where the
threatened  legal  sanction  was  only  a  civil  monetary  penalty.167
Because that sanction would be confidential, the sole risk to the
individual was the loss of money.168 Where the threatened sanc-
tion was the potential to be publicly arrested and tried for tax eva-
sion, those same individuals were unwilling to break the law.169 In
this case, the threat of criminal legal sanctions would be an obvious
deterrent.  Additionally,  the  filing  of  criminal  charges  could
expose these middle-class individuals to a host of social sanctions
because they presumably operate within a conventional community
where  engaging  in  a  criminal  activity  is  considered  morally
unacceptable.170
On the other hand, for individuals who function within a com-
munity where crime is rampant or common, complementary infor-
mal social sanctions may be absent from the deterrence calculus.
These individuals may face no real social stigma should they be
publicly exposed as a criminal.171 In some communities, being
known  as  a  criminal  may  even  have  a  reputation-enhancing
effect.172 This general point about the absence of informal social
sanctions is often made when discussing some of the difficulties of
deterring serious international crimes, such as genocide or crimes
against humanity. Because these types of crimes are committed in
societies where everyone may seemingly belong to a warring or vio-
lent faction, individuals may lose their ability to distinguish right
from wrong or legal from illegal. Moral norms may even compel

IV. ASSESSING THE DETERRENCE THEORY IN THE CONTEXT OF
SOMALI PIRACY
As  noted  above,  various  interested  constituencies  have  long
advocated that prosecuting, rather than releasing, captured pirates
is an important component of any effective long-term solution to
the problem of Somali piracy. That prosecutions will deter future
acts of piracy seems almost assumed. This Article, however, seeks
to go beyond assumptions by specifically analyzing how and under
what circumstances would-be Somali pirates might be deterred by a
rigorous, well-enforced, and strict credible threat of punishment.
It does so by exploring the various aspects of deterrence theory in
the  context  of  Somali  piracy.  It  considers  (1)  whether  Somali
pirates are the types of rational actors who can be deterred by the
threat  of  legal  sanctions;  (2)  how  the  current  legal-sanctions
regime affects a would-be Somali pirate’s decision to commit crimi-
nal acts and whether it poses enough of a credible threat to pro-
duce  a  deterrent  effect;  and  (3)  whether  any  complementary
informal sanctioning regime exists to aid in further deterring indi-
viduals from choosing to become Somali pirates.
A. Somali Pirates as Rational Actors
As an initial matter, evidence tends to suggest that Somali pirates
on the whole are rational actors with a relatively normal risk pro-
file. They can be distinguished easily from the suicide bomber who
accepts a hundred percent risk of death in order to fulfill his mis-
sion of spreading a political message through acts of terrorism. All
criminals who intend to commit violent felonies must face some
risk that their victims will fight back violently or that law enforce-
ment may use deadly force to stop them. Indeed, about five per-
cent of pirates who encountered naval forces were killed during
the period from March 25, 2010, to April 26, 2011.174 On the other
hand, five percent is not one hundred percent. Nor is the five per-
cent risk of death significantly different from that faced by others
engaged in criminal activities.175

2014] Crime & Punishment: Deterring Somali Piracy 633
Even though they risk death, evidence also shows that pirates act
rationally to maximize the likelihood of a successful attack and
minimize the likelihood of being caught or killed. They maximize
the likelihood of a successful hijacking by primarily targeting slow
ships that have low maneuverability.176 Somali pirates minimize
their risk of death by curtailing their activities during monsoon sea-
sons when the seas are most dangerous.177 They move their activi-
ties further out to sea to decrease their chances of being thwarted
by  the  roving  naval  patrols.178  Somali  pirates  also  tend  not  to
engage with ships visibly protected by armed guards.179 Moreover,
if they are caught by the world’s navies, Somali pirates tend to
throw their weapons and other gear overboard to minimize the
chance of successful prosecution for engaging in or attempting an
act of piracy.180
Finally, evidence also indicates that Somali pirates are not “fanat-
ics” driven by some ingrained or instilled hatred or some quest to
further a political agenda. For some years, Somali pirates have
tried to justify their actions by claiming that they were forced to
turn to piracy because of illegal fishing.181 That claim, however, is
generally discredited.182 According to a recent World Bank report,
“fisheries  were  never  a  leading  economic  activity  in  Somalia

. . . .”183 Instead, Somali piracy has adversely affected the fishing
industry in the region because the fishing vessels try to avoid the
possibility of being attacked.184 In short, the general consensus is
that Somali pirates are maximally driven by a profit motive: a quest
to share in the increasingly huge ransoms that are paid to release
ships and crews from being held hostage.185
B. Somali Piracy and the Cost/Benefit Calculation
Even  if  Somali  pirates  are  rational  actors,  deterrence  theory
predicts they will be dissuaded from a life of crime only if the costs
of criminal behavior outweigh the benefits. The main costs on
which the theory focuses are those derived from a legal-sanctions
regime. The regime must produce a sufficiently credible threat of
punishment so it convinces potential offenders that crime is not
worth the punishment.186 The sanctions must be objectively credi-
ble. Additionally, Somali pirates must have some understanding of
the nature of that sanctioning regime and whether it is likely to
impose certain and severe punishment on those who hijack ships
and hold crew members hostage.187 This Section addresses several
considerations relevant to how Somali pirates might calculate costs
and benefits in view of the current legal-sanctions regime for pun-
ishing acts of piracy.
Initially, one might ask whether a Somali pirate could ever be
sufficiently threatened by a legal-sanctions regime given the lack of
opportunity in Somalia for individuals to earn anything close to a
living wage. After all, Somalia is a very poor country, and many
individuals lack viable options for employment.188 Nevertheless,
there are still reasons to conclude that poverty alone does not
mean a credible threat of sanctions could not deter low-income
individuals from becoming criminals.
Although many people throughout the world may be relatively
poor,  not  all  commit  crime.  In  addition,  as  Professor  Hansen
points  out,  not  even  all  people  in  Somalia  become  pirates.189
Rather, piracy is prevalent only in parts of Somalia despite wide-

spread poverty throughout the country.190 Moreover, some of the
regions where piracy is prevalent, such as Puntland,191 are relatively
well-off economically as compared to other areas of Somalia.192
Even though being poor might provide an added incentive to seek
“easy money” through a life of crime, poverty does not necessarily
mean  that  individuals  in  Somalia  have  no  real  choice  but  to
become pirates. There is ample evidence to suggest that many
pirates do not seek only to elevate themselves above the poverty
level. They gamble for the opportunity to obtain big houses, fast
cars, drugs, and the feeling of being “rich.”193
Nevertheless, what is the nature of the current gamble? What
are the potential costs against which Somali pirates must weigh the
chance to earn the riches that can be theirs from a hefty ransom
payment? According to the deterrence theory, the cost calculation
requires the rational individual to consider both the certainty and
severity of punishment.194 As discussed below, this Article con-
cludes that the present legal-sanctions regime is probably insuffi-
cient at least for the certainty of punishment to sufficiently deter
many  would-be  Somali  pirates.  This  Article  concludes  that  the
regime could make punishment more certain.
1. Certainty of Punishment
There are numerous reasons the present legal-sanctions regime
for maritime piracy is not sufficiently enforced to send a credible
threat to would-be Somali pirates that they are to be punished for
their illegal acts.195 First, the international community more com-
monly  releases  captured  pirates  rather  than  prosecutes  those
pirates in their own domestic jurisdictions.196 Yet, piracy is a uni-
versal crime that all states may prosecute without having any nexus

193. See supra notes 33–45 and accompanying text. R
194. See discussion supra Part III.A (discussing deterrence theory).
195. Both the objective likelihood of sanctions and the perception that sanctions will
be forthcoming are relevant to this inquiry about the certainty of punishment; the objec-
tive properties of punishment are important because they influence individual perceptions
about the likelihood of punishment. Paternoster, supra note 1, at 780. In the case of R
Somali piracy, more regular prosecution as opposed to release should raise the perception
that sanctions will be forthcoming.
196. See supra notes 93–95 and accompanying text; see also Kontorovich & Art, supra R
note 122, at 444 (reporting that less than 1.5 percent of the 1158 reported piracy attacks in R
international  waters  between  1998  and  2009  resulted  in  a  universal  jurisdiction
prosecution).\\jciprod01\productn\J\JLE\46-3\JLE304.txt unknown Seq: 30 20-NOV-14 13:56
636 The Geo. Wash. Int’l L. Rev. [Vol. 46
to the offense.197 Because the international community has chosen
to prosecute only a small percentage of captured Somali pirates,
pirates can greatly discount the certainty of punishment. This is
the very cost factor that a number of scholars have suggested as the
most important for certainty and severity of punishment.198
Indeed, consider what message the ten percent rate of prosecu-
tion referenced in the Lang Report sends about the certainty of
punishment.199 While poverty alone may not drive an ordinary
Somali male to consider piracy, a ten percent prosecution rate
could cause some to decide that the benefits of piracy exceed its
probable costs. After all, some economists estimate that “the aver-
age pirate could earn between [$]33,726 and [$]78,840 a year,
depending on the ransom paid.”200 This remuneration is obviously
well above what the ordinary Somali male could otherwise earn. If
the risk of imprisonment is low—as it is presently—the message is
that crime may actually pay.201 Many who have been caught have
been identified as repeat offenders, signifying that some pirates
have internalized the message that maritime piracy is an activity for
which they may not be punished.202
Second,  Somali  pirates  essentially  receive  the  same  message
about the certainty of punishment domestically: they are not likely
to be subjected to legal sanctions. Much evidence indicates that
government officials in the areas where piracy is most prevalent
have  been  complicit  in  helping  the  profitable  criminal  activity
thrive. Many Somali pirate bosses emerged in Central Somalia
after escalating conflicts led to a fragmentation of power and a
decline of local institutions capable to enforce the rule of law.203
In both Puntland and Central Somalia, where most hijacked ships

are anchored, pirates apparently use a mix of financial incentives
and physical threats to co-opt government officials, clan leaders,
businesspeople, and Al-Shabaab militants.204 Indeed, both of Pun-
tland’s presidents, Abdullahi Yusuf Ahmed and Farole, have been
accused of accepting money from pirates.205 Puntland’s police and
coast guard forces still allegedly include former pirates.206 Moreo-
ver, commentators also argue that most pirates either escape or are
protected against arrest by clan members or corrupt police in Pun-
tland.207 In sum, within Somalia, the message is that Somali pirates
can continue with their illegal activities and face little threat of
punishment.
Of course, potential offenders of domestic laws may nevertheless
conclude that the likelihood of punishment for their crimes is low
enough that committing an offense is worth the gamble. Domestic
law enforcement bodies are not always able to capture criminals in
the act or after the fact, and clearance rates for different types of
crimes can vary.208 According to statistics maintained by the U.S.
Federal Bureau of Investigation, law enforcement agencies in the
United States cleared approximately sixty-six percent of murder
offenses and about fifty-nine percent of aggravated assault offenses
in 2011.209 For property offenses, however, law enforcement was
less successful, clearing about twenty-eight percent of robberies
and twelve percent of burglaries.210 Yet these statistics speak to

638 The Geo. Wash. Int’l L. Rev. [Vol. 46
only one aspect of certainty: the possibility that one may never be
caught, as opposed to the possibility that one will be prosecuted
even if caught. In the United States, evidence indicates that the
great majority of suspects who are arrested and turned over to pros-
ecuting authorities are thereafter successfully prosecuted.211 The
world community, however, has sent Somali pirates the message
that even if the world’s navies catch them in the act, they face only
a tiny probability of prosecution. There is little hope that deter-
rence can operate effectively where the threat of prosecution is
miniscule.
The fact that institutions within Somalia may lack either the abil-
ity or willingness to prosecute a sufficient number of pirates only
increases the need for the international community to make piracy
prosecutions a priority. Nonetheless, the international community
may object that a strategy aimed at increasing prosecutions is costly
in terms of both money and resource allocation. Reports indicate
that  states  spent  approximately  $8.8  million  to  try  104  alleged
pirates in 2012.212 The United Nations and member states also
provided funding to Kenya and the Seychelles to conduct piracy
trials.213 The cost of trying piracy suspects is greater in some states
than in others: the seven trials in Europe cost over $1 million each
on average; trials in North America averaged about $300,000 each;
and trials in Africa cost on average less than $300.214 An interna-
tional commitment to prosecute a greater percentage of captured
pirates would similarly cause total yearly prosecution costs to rise.
Cost, however, seems a poor reason to reject an antipiracy strat-
egy that has the potential benefit of stopping Somalis from even
considering piracy as a career choice. Prosecuting individuals who
commit crimes costs money. States nevertheless spend substantial
sums  domestically  on  enforcing  criminal  laws  to  send  a  strong
deterrent message that crime will not pay. For example, the U.S.
federal  government  spent  approximately  $54  billion  on  “the
administration of justice” during 2010.215 The total expenditure
was twenty-four percent. Tina Hotton Mahony & John Turner, Police-Reported Clearance

for the Canadian criminal justice system during 2012 was approxi-
mately C$20.3 billion.216 Australia spent about AUS$12.5 billion
on criminal justice.217 California alone allocated approximately
$9.8 billion for judicial and criminal justice programs for the fiscal
year 2012–2013.218
In reality, all strategies aimed at solving the problem of maritime
piracy are costly. The naval patrols cost upward of $1 billion per
year to maintain and require states to commit their equipment and
personnel to the efforts.219 In 2012, the shipping industry spent
about $1 billion paying armed security guards to protect their ships
and crews from pirate attacks.220 These efforts only hope to con-
tain piracy. The goal of prosecutions is much more far reaching:
to deter crime generally and specifically by sending a message that
criminal behavior will produce costly consequences. Even if prose-
cuting pirates is costly, the money is well spent if it aids deterring
future hijackings by sending a message to Somali pirates that crime
will not pay.
2. Severity of Punishment
The present legal-sanctions regime is less lacking with respect to
the severity of sanctions for piracy offenses. When pirates are pros-
ecuted,  they  can  face  lengthy  prison  sentences,  including  life
sentences.221 They may also face the death penalty in some coun-

tries.222 Reports indicate that a court in Yemen imposed the death
sentence on several Somali pirates.223 The United States filed an
intention  to  seek  the  death  penalty  for  three  Somali  pirates
charged with murdering four Americans whose yacht the pirates
hijacked.224 Those pirates ultimately were given life sentences225—
still a very severe punishment. Whether Somali pirates are aware of
these sentences is a question to which no unequivocal answer is
possible. Answering it would require information about the state
of knowledge among various individuals in Somalia, a task that is
beyond the scope of this Article. Worth noting, though, is that
Somali news outlets in the English language have reported on the
trials and sentences of Somali pirates in foreign jurisdictions.226
One complicating factor for any severity calculation is that the
penalty  a  Somali  pirate  receives  is  dependent  not  only  on  the
nature of the precise crimes he committed (for example, whether
he acted as a guard or murdered a hostage) but also on the sanc-
tioning regime of the prosecuting state and the penalties it assigns
to  different  crimes.  Professor  Kontorovich  reports  that  Somali
pirates tried in foreign jurisdictions have received sentences rang-
ing from four years to life in prison, and he concludes that some of
the sentencing differential is due solely to the systemic differences

2014] Crime & Punishment: Deterring Somali Piracy 641
in  the  punitive  approach  of  the  various  fora.227  The  fact  that
Somali  pirates  who  commit  the  same  types  of  criminal  activity
might be exposed to disparate sentences based on the location of
their prosecution is not ideal from a fairness perspective. Nor is
such sentencing inconsistency optimal in terms of deterrence the-
ory because it means that individuals are less able to predict the
severity of the sanctions they may face upon successful prosecution.
On the other hand, individuals cannot predict with certainty the
sentence they will receive for committing a crime even in a domes-
tic context.228
Although the international context of piracy prosecutions means
that pirates can face different maximum sentences for their crimes,
at least some of those sentences are severe enough that they should
produce a deterrent effect. Moreover, there is evidence suggesting
that a credible threat of severe sanctions can deter Somali pirates.
Consider that Somali piracy came to a virtual standstill for several
months between 2006 and 2007 when the Islamic Courts Union
(ICU)229 was able to control the areas where piracy was most preva-
lent.230 The ICU imposed Sharia law231 and declared that piracy
227. See Kontorovich, supra note 207, at 13–14. R
228. There are many reasons why individuals may not be able to predict in advance
with certainty what punishment they will receive for a particular crime, including that pros-
ecutors often have discretion regarding what charges to file and judges often have discre-
tion to sentence offenders within some range of minimum and maximum penalties. See,
e.g., Ely Aharonson, Determinate Sentencing and American Exceptionalism: The Underpinnings
and Effects of Cross-National Differences in the Regulation of Sentencing Discretion, 76 L. & CON-
TEMP. PROBS. 161, 168–69 (2013) (describing how prosecutors are able to influence sen-
tencing outcomes in the United States even where certain crimes require a mandatory
minimum sentence because of their ability to make charging decisions). The availability of
parole and other early release programs can also make it difficult to predict what sentences
different defendants who commit the same type of crime will actually serve. Id. at 173–74
(generally describing early release programs in the United States and other countries).
229. The Islamic Courts Union (ICU) was a group of Sharia courts that formed a rival
administration to the Transitional Federal Government (TFG) of Somalia. See The Supreme
Islamic Courts Union (ICU), GLOBALSECURITY.ORG, http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/
world/para/icu.htm (last visited Mar. 7, 2014). They ruled from May 2006 until early 2007
when they were ousted by an offensive, which included TFG forces and the Ethiopian
military. Id.  Sharia law is the law of Islam that governs in most Muslim states. It is derived
from the Quran and the teachings of the prophet Muhammad and covers a variety of
subjects. See Toni Johnson & Lauren Vriens, Islam: Governing Under Shariah, COUNCIL ON

was an offense against Islam that would be harshly punished.232 To
signal just how harsh such punishments would be, the ICU staged
public executions of convicted murderers.233 Piracy became virtu-
ally nonexistent shortly after that display—an outcome that speaks
to the deterrent effect severe sanctions can have on Somali piracy
(although this Article is not advocating the public execution of
pirates).234  It  also  lends  support  to  the  conclusion  above  that
Somali pirates are rational individuals, even if they may have rela-
tively few other attractive options for earning a living wage. After
all, the crimes stopped.
Finally, one additional consideration is whether and how the
potential to apply for asylum might factor into a Somali pirate’s
calculations about the likely severity of any punishment. One rea-
son Western nations apparently have been reluctant to use univer-
sal jurisdiction to try maritime piracy cases on their home soil is
because they fear potential asylum claims.235 Yet there is little rea-
son to believe that this potential “benefit” of bringing a claim for
asylum would be sufficient to convince an otherwise rational actor
to discount a credible threat of certain and severe punishment.
First, the very fact of a potential life or death sentence should con-
vince most rational actors that the uncertain chance of obtaining
asylum is not worth it. Second, if all states actually demonstrated
their willingness to prosecute pirates, then pirates would not know
which state would be prosecuting them. As a result, Somali pirates
also could not determine in advance whether they would be tried
by a state that would be more or less likely to grant them asylum.
In some countries, like the United States, those who commit seri-
ous crimes cannot qualify for asylum.236 Moreover, the Counter
Piracy Programme of the UNODC has been working with Somalia
to provide funding for prisons so Somali pirates convicted in other
nations can serve their sentences in the home countries.237 In fact,

dozens of Somali pirates convicted in the Seychelles already have
been transferred to those prisons to serve their sentences.238 If
Somali pirates can be returned to Somalia to serve their sentences,
they also can be denied asylum.
C. Somali Piracy and Complementary Informal Sanctions
As discussed above, scholars argue that the deterrent effect of
formal legal sanctions is greater when accompanied by a threat of
informal social sanctions.239 In the context of Somali piracy, how-
ever, evidence indicates that pirates may not regularly or suffi-
ciently be stigmatized by the community from the public exposure
as a criminal. Apparently, the members of some communities are
not pleased that their youths have taken to hijacking ships in order
to enjoy “easy money” and the added benefits of large houses, fast
cars,  and  drugs.240  Nevertheless,  one  cannot  say  that  Somali
pirates  are  being  shunned;  some  seem  to  envy  the  pirates’
riches.241 Moreover, the pirates appear to have obtained the sup-
port of some government and other leaders who protect them
while they anchor their hijacked ships near shore for months at a
time as they await their hefty ransom payments.242 This support
alone contradicts an environment of stigmatization.

644 The Geo. Wash. Int’l L. Rev. [Vol. 46
Yet,  creating  an  environment  within  Somalia  that  stigmatizes
piracy does not seem impossible. Somali piracy is not the same as
the mass-atrocity crimes the commentators highlight when they
suggest that existing moral norms may actually compel commission
of the crime—indicating that there can be no social stigma to com-
mitting the crime.243 Not everyone in Somalia is a pirate, and not
everyone evidently believes that hijacking ships is proper. Profes-
sor Hansen points out that piracy has never become rampant in
Somaliland precisely because the authorities have been quick to
react to rumors of pirate activity, arresting alleged pirates when
they are in the process of organizing.244 The Puntland govern-
ment, by contrast, has not evidenced the same resolve to stamp out
piracy.245
The problem is that getting government and community leaders
in regions where piracy is prevalent to reverse course and con-
demn piracy could take time. Changing the status quo is not easy,
especially when leaders also have a significant financial stake in
piracy. Rather than wait for local institutions to fully commit to
prosecuting piracy at some date well in the future, the interna-
tional  community  could  commit  to  more  regularly  prosecuting
pirates. Prosecuting offenses is critical to stigmatizing maritime
piracy—to establish a norm in the moral code that brands the prac-
tice reprehensible, as opposed to plentiful and admirable.246 As
Professor Akhavan suggests in his analysis of the deterrent effect of
the ad hoc international criminal tribunals, implementing the pro-
cess of international justice rather than permitting impunity to
reign can produce a sort of “moral propaganda” against commit-
ting illegal actions.247 Thus, to help create a social stigma against
maritime piracy, the international community must regularly pun-
ish the pirates it captures rather than release them without requir-
ing them to suffer any repercussions other than the loss of their
weapons.248 Increasing prosecutions can also give local institutions
(reporting that some elders in the Puntland region were criticizing the government for not
putting a stop to piracy).

the incentive to improve the prosecutorial efforts, because either
they embrace the moral message that piracy is wrong or they see
their bribes dry up when more pirates are prosecuted.249
V. CONCLUSION
Deterrence theory has its critics. Even critics agree, though, that
a credible threat of punishment produces a deterrent effect, even
if such an effect is difficult to prove.250 One cannot even hope to
generally and specifically deter crime, though, absent a credible
threat of punishment. In the case of Somali piracy, that threat is
largely absent because most captured pirates have thus far been
released rather than prosecuted.251 Strategies aimed at containing
the problem of maritime piracy by catching pirates either before or
during the act of hijacking ships are commendable because they
help protect innocent seafarers from harm. This Article, however,
urges states to strive for more: to seek to deter current and future
Somali pirates from even choosing to take to the seas by coupling
containment efforts with a commitment to prosecute the captured
pirates.
This  Article  argues  that  increasing  prosecutions  of  captured
pirates is a necessary component of any “solution” to the problem
of Somali piracy. It is also a plan, as the evidence suggests, that has
a likely chance of success. Strategies aimed at improving employ-
ment opportunities of Somali males or helping to strengthen weak
institutions within Somalia that do not respect the rule of law are
not without merit. Yet a strategy focused on increased prosecu-
tions has more to commend it. First, strategies aimed at providing
individuals with skills to help them earn a subsistence wage, with-
out more, are unlikely to convince those who seek “easy money”
and riches to forswear piracy. Second, strategies aimed at improv-
ing local institutions are not likely to work if some individuals
within those institutions are tied to piracy and obtain great mone-
tary benefits from its continued existence. Nevertheless, increasing
prosecutions has the potential to change the incentives for both
the pirates and their collaborators.
Furthermore, the analysis above suggests that Somali pirates are
rational individuals who can be deterred by a credible threat of
legal sanctions even though they hail from an impoverished coun-
try with weak domestic legal institutions. Although they may have

646 The Geo. Wash. Int’l L. Rev. [Vol. 46
few opportunities to obtain the riches that piracy may afford them,
the evidence does not suggest that Somali pirates have an atypical
risk profile that causes them to be unconcerned with the costs of
their activities. Unlike suicide bombers, they do take precautions
to minimize risks, for example, and avoid the seas at the roughest
and ships they know are protected by armed guards.252 Moreover,
there is reason to believe that even though they may be poor,
Somali pirates would eschew their illegal activities if confronted
with a credible threat of certain and severe sanctions. Here, history
is a guide. When the ICU made clear that it would punish piracy
with death, piracy in Somalia essentially ceased to exist.253
Any formal sanctioning regime may best produce a deterrent
effect if also coupled with complementary informal sanctions: a
social stigma associated with being arrested, tried, and sentenced
for engaging in maritime piracy. At present, the hoped-for prom-
ise of a social stigma may be hard to come by in the regions in
Somalia where piracy is most prevalent.254 Abandoning a commit-
ment to prosecuting pirates is not the answer, however. By prose-
cuting  pirates  rather  than  releasing  them,  the  international
community can begin to create that social stigma by sending a mes-
sage that it finds piracy to be the kind of abhorrent activities that
must  be  morally  condemned  and  subjected  to  criminal
punishment.
This Article hopes to convince states and other policy makers
that increasing the threat of prosecution is a critical part of an
effective and long-term solution to the problem of Somali piracy.
It is cognizant that the credible threat of legal sanctions may not
deter every individual from choosing a pirate’s life. No strategy is
perfect.  Nevertheless,  increasing  the  costs  of  piracy  through  a
demonstrated commitment to prosecute rather than release cap-
tured pirates has the potential to dissuade at least some Somalis
from choosing to seek riches by hijacking ships.
