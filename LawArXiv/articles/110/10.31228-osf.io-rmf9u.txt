BRIDGING THE DIVIDE? THEORIES FOR INTEGRATING
COMPETITION LAW AND CONSUMER PROTECTION
*
MAX HUFFMAN
Commissioner Kovacic of the US Federal Trade Commission has stated that
“consumer protection laws are important complements to competition policy”.1
According to the UK Office of Fair Trading, “[c]ompetition and consumer
policy are interdependent”; together they “provide a framework for markets to
deliver maximum benefits for consumer welfare and productivity growth”.2

“Ido reallythink the two mandates address two sides of the samecoin with the
ultimate goal of economic and consumer welfare”.3 At the Fourth Antitrust

A. INTRODUCTION
Competition law is traditionally conceived as regulation of the marketplace to
ensureprivateconductdoesnotsuppressfreetradeandcompetition.Ithasasits
goalthepreservationof competition.Competitionservestooptimiseconsumers’
interests. Consumer protection regulation denotes a body of law designed to
protectaconsumer’sinterests atthelevelof theindividualtransaction. Thetwo
fields share the same ultimate goal of protecting consumers.
But their approaches to achieving that goal differ. It may be possible to
conceive as the overriding distinction as one of market definition: consumer
protection regulation defines the market to be very small, limited to the
parametersof theindividualtransaction.Thatdifferenceinapproachessuggests

itispossiblethatintegrationof aschemedesignedtoregulatemarketsnation-or
worldwide with a scheme designed to regulate atomistic transactions, which
consumer protection does, is neither realistic nor desirable. Likewise, protecting
consumers in individual transactions with a scheme designed to ensure
competition is preserved may miss the mark. This paper explores those
possibilitiesaswell.
The integration of competition law and consumer protection has both
substantive and systemic components.4 The substantive question is whether
pursuingtheendof consumerwelfareoptimisationthroughmarketregulationis
consistent with pursuing the same end through regulating transactions. The
systemic question is whether an agency or remedial scheme constituted to
advance competition policy can also serve the purpose of protecting individual
consumers or an agency or remedial scheme constituted to protect individual
consumersisconsistentwiththelargergoalof preservingcompetition.

B. THE ELUSIVE CONCEPTOF “CONSUMER HARM”
There is seemingly universal worldwide agreement that competition law and
consumer protection law both exist to protect consumers.5 What is the harm to

and policy questions, and “engineering” to be institutional questions), available at
www.ftc.gov/ftc/workshops/ftc100/docs/ftc100rpt.pdf(accessedon2February2010).
5 Even the most efficiency-minded of US antitrust scholars adopt this view. See RA Bork, The
AntitrustParadox51(NewYork,FreePress,2ndedn,1993)(“consumerwelfare”is“thesolevalue”
underlyingantitrust).Ithasworldwideacceptanceaswell.SeeOECD,“ReportontheSeventh

consumers).

be prevented or remedied remains poorly understood.6 Consumer harm in
competition law may differ from consumer harm in the field of consumer
protection.7Itisalsonecessarytoaskwhatismeantby“consumer”,andwhether
it is the same thing between competition and consumer protection law.
1. Consumer Protection
In the consumer protection field, harm is comparatively easy to define. It is a
break-downinanindividualconsumertransaction.Thefailureusuallyoccursat
theoriginationstage.Butas,forexample,inthecasesof lawsregulatingusuryor
common-law doctrines such as unconscionability, consumer harm can occur in
the substance of the transaction. The failures with which consumer law is
concernedunderminetheconsumer’sabilitytooptimise his orherownwelfare.
Consumer law targets those failings to grant individual consumers remedies. It
thus fills gaps that market forces leave unfilled.
IntheUSsystem,atleast,the“consumer”inconsumerprotectionlawusually
is easy to define: it is the individual, end-user consumer.8 Many US federal
consumer protection statutes limit their application to transactions involving
individualswherethesubjectof thetransaction isprimarilyforpersonal, family,
or household purposes.9 That meaning may be universal: the OFT describes
“[c]onsumerpolicy...asfocusingonhowfirmsinteractwith[individualretail]
consumers,ontradingpracticesandcontractterms”.10
The Federal Trade Commission Act is not so limited. It applies to unfair or
deceptive trade practices generally without regard to the victim of those
practices.11 But theories of deception and unfairness often turn on disparities in
sophistication between the parties, suggesting the individual consumer is the
bettervictim.12

magazines and over the radio”). It is also the case that consumer protection is a populist10 Antitrust Marathon IV ECJ VOL.NO.
2. Competition Law
Defining consumer harm is much more difficult in competition law. The
consumer harm in US competition law generally is phrased in terms of
decreasedoutputandincreasedprices.13Thedictumthatcompetitionlawshould
beprimarilyconcernedwithconsumerwelfareismorefullyunderstoodtomean
competitionlawseekstopreventharmtocompetition,andconsumerwelfarewill
be thereby maximised.14
Such an approach has the tendency to undermine any direct intervention on
behalf of individual consumers. If an individual transaction produces a
sub-optimal result, competition law assumes the marketplace will supply the
resolution.15 The incapable or shady merchant will be replaced by one who
servesconsumers’wishesanddoessofairly.Acrossthemassof consumers,then,
welfare may be optimised. The handful of consumers left unsatisfied before the
losing producerexitedthemarketaretoo fewtobringdowntheaverage.Those
fewdonotreflect“harmtocompetition”.16
The definition of “consumer antitrust” remains under-theorised.17 That is a
remarkable reality, given the frequency with which consumer welfare is invoked
tojustifyaparticulardecisionorpolicyprescription.18Thereremainsavigorous
debate whether consumers benefit when economic efficiency is maximised, and
endeavour, and protecting individual end-users makes for a better press release than does

whogetsthesurplusisunimportant,orcompetitionlawrequiresthatconsumers
ratherthanproducersbenefitfromsurpluswelfare.19
Averitt and Lande’s “consumer choice” paradigm harmonises competition
law and consumer protection. Competition law, by protecting competition,
ensuresconsumershaveoptionsavailabletothem.Consumerprotectionensures
that “consumers are able to make a reasonably free and rational selection from
among those options”.20 That elegant resolution suggests that antitrust and
consumer protection are complementary so long as consumer protection targets
the origination phase of the consumer transaction, dealing with theories of
deception and their close cousin, disclosure regulation. Averitt and Lande’s
paradigm does not hold where consumer protection regulation targets
substantive transaction terms, because those terms limit, rather than enhance,
consumerchoice.
C. DOCTRINALAND THEORETICAL INNOVATIONS
In this section I discuss four legal innovations and their place in antitrust and
consumer protection, respectively. First is the common use of deception
rationales in consumer protection and competition law enforcement. Second is
the application of behavioural economics in both consumer protection and
competition law enforcement. Third is market manipulation as a specific
exampleof ahybridcompetition/consumer protectiontheory.Fourthandlastis
monopoly exploitation as a specific example of a hybrid competition/consumer
protection theory.
1. Deception
Deception is the quintessential consumer harm.21 Deception operates at the
origination phase of a consumer transaction. It limits consumers’ abilities fully
andfairlytonegotiatethetermsof thetransactionandcausesthemtoenterinto
transactions they would otherwise eschew. Deception thus strikes at the

foundation of the freedom of contract and welfare optimisation through free
choice. Harm exists even where the transaction is otherwise “fair” to the
consumer.
According to Professor Stucke, circumstances may exist in which deception
also is competitive harm.22 He argues that profit-maximising firms would only
engage in deception if the expected benefits, in the form of monopoly profits,
outweighed the expected costs, which include the costs of the deceitful
advertising, the criminal and civil liability that may attend, and the “potential
loss of sales, goodwill, and competitive advantage if the deceit is uncovered”.23
He proposes that a prima facie case of a violation of section 2 of the Sherman
Act should be established by proof that a monopolist engaged in deceitful
conduct which is reasonably capable of creating or maintaining monopoly
power.24
Itisnotdifficulttoseehow,intheory,deceptioncanharmthemarketplaceas
well as the individual consumer. Market forces operate on the basis of
consumers’ revealed preferences. Where consumer decisions are made on the
basis of material misinformation, consumer contracting decisions do not reveal
consumerpreferencesinanyrealsense.Theveryharmthatgivesrisetoliability
underconsumerprotectiontheoriesalsopresentsapossiblecompetitiveconcern.
Moreover, economists have proved that deception will exist in some optimal
amount whenever one of two conditions holds. Either there must be a strong
belief thatthedeceptionwillnotbeexposed,orthefirmmustnotbeconcerned
about repeat business.25 A monopoly or near-monopoly marketplace satisfies
both conditions. Consumers have no alternatives, so must return to the
monopoly producer if they want to make a purchase. And the chance of
deceptionbeingexposedisminimisedbecausetherearenocompetitorsavailable

Deceptionmightalsopresentatheoryof harminoligopolyindustries.Firms
in an industry marked by few participants and with homogenous goods (or
homogeneous characteristics of differentiated goods) might find it advantageous
not to expose their competitors’ deception, but instead to imitate it.27 A ready
example of this is the parallel failure of cigarette manufacturers to expose the
harm caused by rivals’ products.28 Jurisdictions that pursue theories of harm
through tacit collusion might consider tacitly collusive deception as a form of
illegal coordinated conduct. Tacitly collusive deception is certainly not, or likely
tobecome,atheoryof harmintheUSsystem.29
Recent mainstream antitrust thinking in the United States has tended to
assume deception cannot have real market effects.30 It appears that the EC
sharesthisgeneralviewinitsenforcementof Article82of theECTreaty.Inthe
2 September 2009 Guidance paper on enforcement priorities, deception by a
dominant firm was not discussed as a specific form of abusive conduct.31 The
CanadianCompetition Bureau’sdraftupdatedenforcementguidelinesforabuse
of dominance, interpreting sections 78 and 79 of the Competition Act, likewise
fail to mention deception as impermissible conduct.32 However, “misleading

2. Behavioural Exploitation
Behavioural economics has a natural place in consumer protection regulation.
According to Professor Greenfield, “behavioral economics teaches that
consumers are not necessarily rational actors and that sellers may structure
transactions in such a way as to take advantage of this lack of rationality”.34
There is a deep body of literature, in both the popular35 and the academic36
presses,expandingonthatreality.AccordingtoCavendishElithorn,commenting
on anearlierdraftof this paperatthe Fourth Antitrust Marathon, “[q]uitealot
of behaviouraleconomicsis...whatmarketershaveknownandusedfor years”.37
The Bureau of Economics at the US Federal Trade Commission has
recognised this reality. It held a conference on behavioural economics and
consumer policy in 2007.38 At that conference, papers demonstrating consumer
decision-making biases and merchants’ abilities to exploit those biases were
presentedandcritiqued.39Theagencycurrentlyisundertaking“twoexploratory
studiesonconsumersusceptibilitytofraudulentanddeceptivemarketing”.40The
studies will concentrate on “several decision-making biases . . . that can cause
inaccurate assessments of the risks, costs, and benefits of various choices”.41 As
of now, however, how exactly to incorporate behaviouralist principles into a
coherentenforcementregimeremainsunder-studied.

Although the Federal Trade Commission has begun to study the theories, it
has not so far articulated an approach to consumer protection that protects
consumers from their own irrational behaviour.42 Overtones of behaviouralist
theories can be found in semi-subjective standards for deception, based on the
“reasonable consumer” test (which implies a lack of sophistication)43 or in
especially protective legislation targeted at college students.44 Disclosure
requirements also may be predicated on concerns for exploitation. For example,
regulations requiring that warnings be highlighted or be particularly vivid45
might be linked to known tendencies to consumer optimism or seek themselves
to exploit the so-called “vividness” bias. The Federal Trade Commission’s
consumer education efforts may also be explained in part by a desire to
overcomeconsumers’decision-makingbiasesinindividualtransactions.
By contrast, behaviouralist theories are slow to catch on in the analysis of
competition law.46 Neither of the US agencies has incorporated behaviouralism
into their enforcement paradigms.47 Professors Maurice Stucke and Avishalom
Tor are two of the few to have analysed the role of behavioural economics in
competition policy. According to Stucke, assumptions of rational conduct by

requirementsforcigarettemanufacturers).
46 It may be possible to conceive of all conduct presenting competitive harms as deceptive or
behaviourally exploitative in nature. The definition of most abusive dominant firm conduct
assumes net consumer harm over the period of anticompetitive conduct and subsequent
recoupment.Repeatplayerconsumersactingrationallywouldnotmakepurchasingdecisionsthat

The demand-side question is a different matter. Behavioural economics
teaches that consumers are not always rational. The Office of Fair Trading

In “Money, is that What I Want?”, Stucke questions the assumptions of
rational choice on the part of consumers.51 He stops short of prescribing a
theory of competitive harm based on “behavioural exploitation”—which I

A theory of competitive harm through behavioural exploitation might
approximate the theory of competitive harm through deception discussed in
Section C.1 supra. By exploiting known biases in consumer decision-making, a
monopolistcanmaintain,orperhapsevenattain,monopolypower,justasitdoes

sale of lending products to consumers in the years leading up to the collapse of
the housing bubble.57 Consumers’ agreeing to teaser-rate mortgages can be
explained by decision-making biases such as irrational tendencies to over-
optimism,58 which would cause borrowers to believe they will be able to pay the
mortgage or sell the house once the rate adjusts. In another paper discussed at
the Fourth Antitrust Marathon, Professors Janger and Block-Lieb explain the
phenomenon in terms of “cognitive limitations”, “heuristic biases, such as
optimism and endowment effects”, and “time-inconsistent preferences, some-

It is difficult to demonstrate the competitive harm, rather than harm to one
consumer,  flowing  from  a  course  of behavioural  exploitation.  But  the  same
rationale supporting deception as a competitive harm should apply to
behavioural exploitation, perhaps even with more force. The market impacts of
falsely revealed preferences must produce allocative inefficiencies as resources
flow to uses that reflect consumers’ apparent, rather than actual, preferences.

enforcement. “Regulatory agencies have an inbuilt incentive to continuously expand their

Thus,aswithdeception,twocriteriaforsomeamountof behaviouralexploi-
tation being rational are a lack of expectation of repeat player business and a
low risk of detection.61 A monopoly marketplace satisfies both criteria, with no
competitors to expose the behavioural exploitation and no other options
available to consumers. Monopoly maintenance through behavioural exploi-
tation seems likely to be successful. Acquiring a monopoly through behavioural
exploitation is less likely to succeed.62 More so even than with deception,
competitorsarethemost likelyexposersof exploitation.63Also,if exploitation is
exposed and counteracted, consumers have competitive options for their
purchasingdecisions.
3. Market Manipulation
One recent example of agency law-making in the US is worth studying as an
example of combined competition law and consumer protection theories. On 4
November 2009, an FTC rule dealing with market manipulation in the
petroleum industry became effective. Promulgated under the authority of the
EnergyIndependenceandSecurityActof 2007,64therule“prohibitsfraudulent
or deceptive conduct that could harm wholesale petroleum markets”.65
Marketmanipulationasatheoryof competitiveharmissufficientlyuniquein
the US system that this approach required the first antitrust rulemaking in US
history.66 The description of the rule and its purposes reads much more like
classic consumer protection doctrine. The FTC is concerned with “fraud”,
“deceit”and“omissionsof materialinformation”.67But,unlikeclassicconsumer
protection doctrine, which Section B shows is concerned with individual
end-userconsumers,themarketmanipulationruleisconcernedonlywithharms
in the wholesale marketplace.68 Concerns for harm at wholesale rather than

retail are reminiscent of theories of competitive, not consumer, harm.69 In fact,
in antitrust suits by purchasers under the US antitrust laws, harm is only
cognisableinthewholesalemarketplace.70

includefalselyreportingpricesinwholesaletransactions.Falsepricereportsmay
impactnewentrants’decisionswhethertodevoteresourcestoentry.71Suchfalse
reporting,if effectiveinexcludingcompetitors,wouldpresentaclearcompetitive
harm.
False reporting of prices will be successful only if not counteracted by
competitors. A producer with de minimis market power will have no ability to
influence competitive entry decisions through price reporting. By contrast,
producers in an oligopoly marketplace may tacitly collude in false price
reporting,andamonopolyproducerwillbeabletocontrolpricereportsthrough
itsunilateralconduct.
Harm to consumers can occur where prices are pegged to a benchmark and
the manipulation serves to impact that benchmark in the seller’s favour.72 But
because the rule operates in the wholesale marketplace, some form of pass-
through would be required to produce an effect on individual end-user
consumers.
4. Monopoly Exploitation
The US system has traditionally viewed abuse of properly acquired monopoly
power as not presenting a competition law concern,73 although it may implicate
between conduct in bilateral negotiations, which are “unlikely to affect the integrity of the
market”, and “widely disseminated” false statements or omissions, which have market-wide
consequences. The former are not intended to be covered by the prohibitionon manipulation,
whilethelatterare.Seeibid,3,10.

wheretheabuse“hashad,ishaving,orislikelytohavetheeffectof substantially
preventingorlesseningcompetition ...[H]ighpricesdonotinthemselvesraise
issues under the Act”.76
Charging excessively high prices is the most obvious example of such a
monopoly abuse. Standard microeconomic theory proposes that charging high
prices is what incentivises new entry, so is likely to bring about the downfall of
themonopolists’position.77
TheEChasannouncedthatsuch“directlyexploitative”conductmayinfringe
Article 82, prompting Commission intervention “in particular where the
protection of consumers and the proper functioning of the internal market
cannot otherwise be adequately assured”.78 Examples exist of prosecutions for

D. ENFORCEMENT SYSTEMS
The systemic question is whether an agencyconstituted to advance competition
policy can also serve the purpose of protecting individual consumers. It is
possible consumer protection enforcement is best placedin the hands of private
litigants. It is logical to question whether public enforcement of consumer
protection laws, or consumer-protection-like behavioural exploitation, market
manipulation or monopoly exploitation claims under a competition framework
fails the test of comparative advantage. Such enforcement may rely on the
particulars of individual consumers’ circumstances in a way that favours private
enforcement over public. By contrast, some have questioned the capacity of
private litigants to remedy harms felt across the marketplace, rather than in
individual transactions.
1. Agency Structure
A plurality of national competition agencies are combined with their consumer
protection watchdogs.82 In the US, the Federal Trade Commission83 and many
stateenforcementagenciesaresostructured.TheCanadianCompetitionBureau
and Competition Tribunal combine competition law and consumer protection
enforcement mandates.84 That is the chosen structure for the UK Office of Fair
Trading85 and, as of recently, the Irish Competition Authority.86 DG Com-
petition has created a “dedicated Consumer Liaison unit”.87 According to the
OFT,“[f]romarecent‘backof theenvelope’checkon37othercountries,wesee
that about one third of them also have agencies in which competition and
consumer functions are combined”.88 If enforcement systems compete just as to

participantsinthecommercialmarketplace,thesuccessof thedual-responsibility
agency seems apparent.
It is harder to explain why an agency with a divided mission should be
preferable to one with a single purpose.89 Commissioner Kovacic has written:
“The Commission’s capacity to meld expertise in economics, competition, and
consumer protection is a conscious element of its institutional design and a
major reason for its existence”.90 Efficiencies do clearly exist in consolidated
management, and the Bureau of Economics serves the enforcement efforts of
both legal bureaus. And the market manipulation rule (Section C.3, supra)
appears to provide an example of cooperative efforts between the competition
lawyers and consumer protection lawyers at the agency.91 The Canadian
experience with efficiencies and occasional coordinated enforcement efforts is
similar.92
On the other hand, anecdotal hearsay evidence suggests that at the Federal
Trade Commission, the Bureaus of Competition and Consumer Protection
rarely coordinate enforcement efforts.93 Commissioner Aitken recognised the
tensionsandmanagerialchallengesinherentintherealitiesof easywinsinsmall
cases for consumer protection contrasted with the esoteric theories and difficult
litigationinlargercasesforcompetitionlaw.94
The OFT recognises the limited gains from ostensible integration.95 “Until
recently[, its] competition and consumer enforcement work sat within two
separatedivisions—ineffecttwosiloswiththeirownlegalandintellectualworlds
which had little to do with each other.”96 But the OFT is optimistic about the
possibilitiesforfurtherintegrationgoingforward.97
89 Perhaps supporting this assertion, Paul Gorecki noted in comments at the Fourth Antitrust
Marathon that Ireland chose an administrative structure which separated competition
enforcementfromconsumerprotection,butlatercombinedthemina“shotgunmarriage”,with
“nostudy”,and“mainlyforbudgetaryreasons”(infrapp33–34).

Similar to the FTC bureaus’ combined efforts in market manipulation,
producing a rule that is susceptible to characterisation as both competition law
and consumer protection (see Section C.3, supra), OFT recognises that “[w]hat
begins as a competition issue may turn out to be more susceptible to consumer
remedies,andviceversa”.98CommissionerAitkennotedaparticularexampleof
a merger review in which “[w]e had our fair business folks, our consumer
protectionfolks looking at it, our abuse of dominance folkslooking at the conduct
as well and then of course our merger folks looking at the merger”. That was, in
her view, an example of a successful coordinated cross-agency effort.99 None of

2009 White Paper on integration explained what result would obtain where an
irreconcilabletensionarosebetweenenforcersfocusedoncompetitionpolicyand

As one example of its integrated enforcement efforts, the OFT describes a
processof marketstudiesinrecentyearsandcurrently,studyingbothsupply-side
and demand-side characteristics of a particular industry. Maurice Stucke
recently has proposed just such an approach to innovative enforcement for the
US system.101 It is possibleintra-agencycooperation is morerealistic at the level
of market-wide regulatory efforts, like those described by the OFT in its White
PaperorrecommendedbyStucke,incontrastwithcaseworkinaspecificinvesti-

by Commissioner Aitken, which, with the structural remedies at issue, is more

gation.
2. Private Enforcement
Systems analysis must also consider the role of private enforcement. Private
enforcement has been a hallmark of the US system of competition law
enforcement since its inception, with the powerful incentives to private suit
offeredbythetrebledamagesremedyandclassactiondevice.102Privateremedies
have been available in Canada since 1976.103 The European Commission

recently clarified the standards under which private damages actions are
permissibleforbreachesof Articles81and82.104Nosystemworldwidehasrelied
as heavily on private enforcement as has the US.105
There are difficult questions whether private competition law enforcement is
consistent with the efficiency goals of competition law. Private litigants may be
wrongly incentivised to pursue the efficiency goals of competition law.106 Public
agencies charged with remedying market-wide competitive harms are less likely
toengageinstrategiclitigationfavouringindividualresultsoversocialwelfare.107
But in general, the past decade has seen an increase in the availability of
private damages actions worldwide.108 Meanwhile, since 1977 decisions by
federal courts in the US have severely curtailed the availability of private
damages actions in competition law, imposing stringent standing limitations,109
pleading requirements110 and direct-purchase requirements,111 as well as limiting
thesubstantivecausesof action.112
In contrast with competition law, where debates rageas to the propriety of a
privateaction,113privateenforcementof consumerprotectionlawsseemsentirely
appropriate. In the US system many consumer protection statutes provide
specific incentives in the form of statutoryminimum damagesand attorneyfees
104See European Commission, supra n 31, paras 15–17, 5–6. The Commission has “suggest[ed]”
representative actions by consumer associations or trade associations and “opt-in collective

for successful plaintiffs.114 Private consumer protection enforcement rarely
involves concerns for strategic litigation by competitors.115 The harm sought to
be remedied by the legal scheme is the harm in the individual transaction, so
there is a perfect alignment of interests between the consumer plaintiff and the
legal scheme. Although anti-regulation zealots might contend market forces

E. CONCLUSION
This issue paper discusses the question whether and how the integration of
competition law and consumer protection can be accomplished. The differing
understandings of consumer harm, and the remedy for that harm, between the
disciplines presents ostensible tension. But there is room for common
enforcement theories. Only where consumer protection serves to remove
consumer choice, by targeting substantive transaction terms, are the disciplines
actually irreconcilable.
Systems of enforcement also may differ between the fields. Private
enforcement is a more natural fit for consumer protection than for competition
law because of the focus consumer protection places on individual consumer
transactions. Circumstances will exist in which competition law is better left to
government enforcers. Within agencies, combining consumer protection and
competition law has obvious efficiency benefits, but the extent of benefit in the
productsof theagencies’workislessclear.
