Evaluating the Impact of the Indian Supreme Court Judgment 
on Sex-Selective Abortion 
 
By Sital Kalantry and Arindam Nandi 
 
Introduction 
 
Lawyers bring public interest litigation  cases (“PIL”) to the Indian Supreme Court 
seeking many different types of remedies, including  to prevent the construction of power 
plants that may damage the environment or to prevent violations  of rights of a group of 
people. The Indian Supreme Court (the “Supreme Court” or “Court”) sometimes 
responds by creating guidelines  like what the executive branch might do. But in many 
PIL cases, litigants  are not asking for the creating of new rules, but instead they are 
simply  asking the Supreme Court to encourage the government to amend, implement,  and 
enforce laws that already exist.   
 
In this chapter, we investigate one such case-- the public interest litigation  bought by the 
Center for Enquiry into Health and Allied  Themes (“CEHAT”), Mahila Sarvangeen 
Utkarsh Mandal (“MASUM”), and Sabu George in 2000. These public interest litigants 
were concerned about the rate of selective abortions of fetuses when the future biological 
sex of the child was determined to be female. Starting in the 1980s ultrasound machines 
became more widely available in India and this allowed families to detect the future 
biological  sex of their children and some women chose to abort fetuses when the future 
sex was predicted to be female.  To curb this practice the government had passed a law 
that became effective in 1996 to prevent medical professionals from giving  information 
to pregnant women about the future sex of their children.   
 
The public interest litigants  claimed that the law had not been implemented  by the Union 
and State governments of India.  The Supreme Court kept jurisdiction  of the case for 
three years until 2003. During this time it asked for various reports from State 
governments and prodded the Union government to amend and strengthen its anti-sex 
determination  legislation.   
 
Defining success broadly, it appears that the Supreme Court’s intervention  was 
successful—the Union government did indeed amend and strengthen the law. We observe 
this through the dialogue in Supreme Court hearings with relevant stakeholders and also 
by examining  the discussions in the Indian Parliament about the Supreme Court’s orders 
in this case.  Of course, Parliament may have amended the law even without Supreme 
Court intervention. 
 
However, from a narrow measure of success, the Supreme Court’s orders in this case 
were an utter failure. The ultimate goal of the litigants  was to decrease abortions of 
female fetuses, which they hoped to do by encouraging the Supreme Court to push the 
Union governement to amend the law to close loopholes  and to push State governments 
to implement  the existing  law.  But, according to our data, the rate of abortions of female 
fetuses did not decrease during the time the Supreme Court held a number of hearings on 
  1 the case (2000 to 2003) and did not decrease even after the amendments were made to the 
anti-sex determination  law in 2002.  On the contrary, the number of female births 
decreased every year. 
 
Simply  referring to the Indian Census data makes it abundantly clear that that sex ratios 
(the number of girls to boys born in any given time period) decreased from 2001 to 2011.  
What is unique about the data set we utilize  is that it observes year-by-year variation to 
track the impact from the initiation  of the public interest litigation  and immediately  after 
the 2003 decision when the court issued its final order in the case.  Thus, while the Indian 
Census will show the change over a period of 10 years, our data can be used to determine 
whether there were any improvements  during the shorter period of time that the Supreme 
Court had jurisdiction  over the case and year-by-year after the enactment of amendments 
to the anti-sex determination  law in 2002. Moreover, the Indian census only reports the 
sex ratio of children from birth to six years of age. Our data set consists of birth data, 
which would be more immediately  sensitive to increased enforcement efforts for 
example.    
 
We conjecture that when the Supreme Court intervenes to change deep-seated cultural 
desires such as the desire for many families who want to have at least one male-child,  it 
may be less successful than when it attempts to intervene  in matters that do not relate to 
deeply held personal views of many people. In addition,  given that much of the illegal 
behavior that the Supreme Court wants to curb takes place outside of the scrutiny of the 
public view, the law is inherently  difficult  to enforce.   
 
In Section I, we describe the origin of the Indian sex ratio crisis.  We then detail the 
responses of Parliament and the Indian Supreme Court to the excess of males and 
shortage of females in Section II.  In Section III, we describe the sex ratio trends over 
time and geography in India. Our analysis of the impact of the public interest litigation  is 
in Section IV.  The final section (Section V) examines the causes of the sex ratio crisis 
and explains why the Indian Supreme Court judgment has not achieved results. 
 
I. The Indian Sex Ratio Crisis Begins 
 
In the 1970s, amniocentesis technology—meant  to diagnose genetic 
abnormalities,  but also capable of determining  the sex of a fetus—became 
available in India. Ironically,  the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, the 
country’s most prestigious  medical school, was the first to offer these tests at its 
government teaching hospital. Other government hospitals soon followed suit. 
While the technology  was meant to identify genetic abnormalities  in a fetus, 
doctors also used the tests to identify the sex of the fetus and would offer an 
abortion if the sex was not what the mother desired.1  
The doctors performing the sex-selective abortions justified  them on population 
control grounds. Indeed, population  control is arguably a more important  goal in 
India today than it was then. India has only 2.5 percent of world’s land and yet

  2 must accommodate and feed 17 percent of the world’s people.2 The population 
density of India is 377.7 inhabitants  per square kilometer compared to only 142.9 
in China and 31.85 in the United States.3  
The doctors who first began performing sex detection tests published  an article in 
Indian Pediatrics explaining that they had conducted trials using amniocenteses 
for sex determination  and found that “seven of the eight patients who had tests 
carried out primarily  for the determination  of sex of the fetus” aborted their 
female fetuses.4 In the past, American foundations actively supported population 
control efforts in India, including  sex-selective abortions.5 In 1978, the use of 
amniocenteses for purposes of sex determination  was banned in government 
hospitals,  but private clinics emerged to fill the growing demand.6 
Given that amniocenteses involves the removal of amniotic fluid and a laboratory 
in which the testing must be conducted, these tests were mostly available in cities 
and only affordable for middle-class  or rich people. A new technology,  however, 
changed financial and physical access dramatically:  the ultrasound.  
By the mid-1980s,  many clinics in the capital city of Delhi offered prenatal ultrasound 
exams.7 With a growing middle class and increasing access to ultrasound machines used 
to detect the sex of the fetus, more abortions occurred, and the sex ratio became further 
male-skewed.8  
 
In the late 1980s, offensive advertisements promoting  sex determination  tests were 
commonly  visible  in India. Commentators often point out that advertisements would 
state, “Pay 500 rupees now and save 50,000 (in dowry) later.”9 In the state of Haryana, 
the sex ratio dipped as low as 879 women per 1000 men.10 Indian feminists quickly  took 
notice.

II. Parliament and the Indian Supreme Court Response 
 
Parliament Bans Sex Determination (1994)  
 
Unlike in the United States where the push to ban sex-selective abortion is rooted 
in the anti-abortion  movement, India’s movement to curb it was initiated  by 
feminists.11 In 1982, a group of women’s organizations  protested to demand a 
complete ban on sex determination  tests.12 In Mumbai, a group called the Forum 
Against Sex Determination and Sex Pre-Selection was created in 1985.13 These 
groups were explicit in their goal—they did not want to place restrictions on 
abortion access, but instead demanded that medical professionals be prohibited 
from telling  patients the sex of their fetus.14 The state government of Maharashtra, 
where Mumbai is located, passed legislation  to ban sex determination  tests in 
1988 before any national legislation  was passed.15 
Six years later, in 1994, the Government of India enacted the Pre-Natal Diagnostic 
Techniques (Regulation and Prevention of Misuse) Act (PNDT). This law, which came 
into effect in 1996, prohibited  the use of techniques (such as ultrasounds and 
amniocentesis) to determine the sex of the fetus after conception.  
 
Public Interest Litigation in the Supreme Court Commences (2000) and the final 
Supreme Court Judgment (2003) 
 
Arguing that national and state governments did not take necessary measures to 
enforce the PNDT, advocates brought a petition  to the Supreme Court of India 
using a mechanism called public  interest litigation  whereby people without

  4 standing are able to bring cases directly to the Supreme Court to enforce social 
justice issues.16 In September 2000, the Center for Enquiry into Health and Allied 
Themes (CEHAT), Mahila Sarvangeen Utkarsh Mandal (MASUM), and Sabu 
George argued to the Indian Supreme Court that the government had failed to 
implement  the PNDT.17 The petitioners asked, among other things, that 
appropriate authorities be appointed at the state and district levels to monitor 
compliance with the PNDT.  
The Supreme Court issued several interim orders with very specific directions to 
the Union government and State governments to facilitate implementation  of the 
Act.18 Through an examination  of the numerous orders, it appears that the 
Supreme Court was in dialogue  with the State governments19 and Union 
government.  First, it is ordering State governments to submit detailed reports 
about its compliance efforts. For example, on April 30, 2002, the Court asked 
several states to fill affidavits within 15 days reporting a number of things, 
including  why they failed to seize ultrasound machines that were not properly 
registered pursuant to the PNDT. Second, it is drawing attention to the issues and 
failure of implementation.  The Court notes that “there is a total slackness by the 
administration  in implementing  the Act.”20 Third, it asks the body that was 
appointed pursuant to the PNDT to propose amendments to that PNDT to include 
newer technology  and new methods that can be used to sex select that was not 
previously  included in the prohibition.21 
Through the course of the three years within which it kept jurisdiction  in the case, 
its interventions  served to remind the Union and State governments about the 
importance of curbing sex selection, about its lack of implementation,  and the 
need for amendments to the PNDT. The Supreme Court kept at this task even 
though many State governments failed to comply with the Court’s requests. 
Indeed, in one of his orders in the case, Justice Shah laments that “it appears that 
the directions issued by this Court are not complied  with.”22 
In 2003, the Indian Supreme Court issued its final judgment  in the case. It 
repeated many of the recommendations that it had already issued to the various

  5 stakeholders involved  in prior orders.23 Below are examples of some of the 
“directions” issued to each relevant stakeholder.  Some of its directions seem to 
apply even after the date of the final order. After closing the case though, the 
Supreme Court had even less ability  to ensure that any of its directions were 
actually complied  with than when it kept the case open.  
Directions to the Central Government 
•  To create public awareness against the practice of sex selection and sex 
determination. 
•  To implement  the Act with all vigour and zeal. 
Directions to the Central Supervisory Board 
•  To call for meetings at least once in six months. 
•  To review and monitor  implementation  of the Act. 
•  To call for quarterly updates from State and Union Territory (UT) 
Appropriate Authorities regarding the implementation  and working of the Act. 
•  To examine the necessity of amending the Act keeping in mind emerging 
technologies  and difficulties  in implementation  of the Act. 
•  To lay down a code of conduct to be observed by persons working under 
the Act and to ensure its due publication. 
•  To require Medical Professional Bodies/Associations  to create awareness 
and to ensure implementation  of the Act. 
Directions to State Governments and UT Administrations 
•  To appoint by Notification  fully empowered Appropriate Authorities at 
the district and sub district levels. 
•  To appoint Advisory Committees to aid and advise Appropriate 
Authorities. 
•  To furnish a list of Appropriate Authorities in the print and electronic 
media. 
•  To create public awareness against the practice of sex selection and sex 
determination. 
•  To ensure that Appropriate Authorities furnish quarterly returns to the 
Central Supervisory Board, giving  information  on the implementation  and 
working of the Act. 
                                                             
23 CEHAT v. Union of India, 2003 SOL Case No. 547 (2003).  
  6 Directions to Appropriate Authorities 
•  To take prompt action against any person or body that issues or causes to 
be issued any advertisement in violation  of the Act. 
•  To take prompt action against all bodies and persons who are operating 
without valid Certificate of Registration under the Act. 
•  To furnish quarterly returns to the Central Supervisory  Board about the 
implementation  of the Act. 
Indian Parliament Amends the PNDT (2002) 
In examining  the transcripts of various committee discussions about sex selection, it is 
clear that members of the Rajya Sabha, one of the two houses of Parliament, were keenly 
aware of the Supreme Court’s orders.  For example, Prema Cariappa, a Member of 
Parliament from Karnataka observed that “the hon'ble Supreme Court has passed an order 
on 4th May, 2001 directing the registration of all bodies using the ultrasound equipment, 
under the Pre-natal Diagnostic Techniques (Regulation  and Prevention of Misuse) Act, 
1994.”24 On another day, the Member of Parliament from Tamil Nadu even quoted one of 
the Supreme Court orders at length.

  7  
Over the course of the time the Supreme Court held jurisdiction,  the Ministers of Health 
were often called to testify about the case. For example, on November 25, 2002, the 
Minister of Health and Family Welfare (Shri Raja) discussed the Supreme Court orders to 
State governments in great detail and specifically noted that the “the Hon’ble Supreme 
Court of India has been issuing directions since May 2001 to the Union of India as well 
as State/UTs.” He also points out that implementation  of the PNDT rests with the States 
and Union Territories. 
 
On Dec 16, 2002, the Rajya Sabha again asked the Minster of Health and Family Welfare 
to report on the Supreme Court order. He provided a detailed overview of the July 10, 
2002 order and indicated that the Supreme Court ordered certain states to act against 
clinics that were still advertising  sex determination  tests despite the fact that was illegal. 
The states indicated that 305 ultrasound machines were seized.  A “National Inspection 
and Monitoring  Committee” has been set up to “kept watch on all States and UTs,” which 
apparently makes surprise visits to clinics. 
 
The Lok Sabha, the other house of Parliament, also discussed the Supreme Court orders.  
In its 13th session on December 20, 2002, the Minister of Health specifically noted that 
the “The hon. Supreme Court has further directed amending the PNDT Act” and then he 
went on to make specific suggestions for amendments which he said is based on the 
recommendations of the Central Supervisory Board that was constituted under the PNDT. 
Indeed, this is the entity that the Supreme Court had directed to propose amendments to 
the PNDT.  
 
The Central Supervisory Board did propose amendments to the PNDT. Thereafter, the 
Parliament amended the PNDT, changing its title to “The Pre-Conception and Pre-Natal 
Diagnostic Techniques (Prohibition  of Sex Selection) Act” (PCPNDT). 25 The PCPNDT 
(among other things) increases the penalties and other regulations  targeted at clinics.26 
Even though the amendments were meant in part to address advancements in sex 
determination  technology,  the reality is that most people are not likely  to use this 
technology,  in vitro fertilization  (“IVF”), for sex selection purposes because they are 
expensive. IVF together with a test to determine the sex of an embryo costs $5500 in 
India.27  
 
Medical personnel and individuals  who violate the PCPNDT are subject to criminal 
penalties and fines. Every clinic that uses diagnostic tests that can be used for sex

  8 determination  must register them.28 Each local jurisdiction  must appoint a local officer 
monitor compliance with the PCPNDT.29 The PCPNDT further requires all clinics, 
centers, and laboratories to maintain  records of all prenatal diagnostic tests they conduct 
in order to monitor their use. Additionally,  the PCPNDT prohibits anyone from selling 
ultrasound machines to unregistered clinics or laboratories.30 Likewise, the PCPNDT 
prohibits  any kind of advertising  of pre-conception or prenatal sex determination.31  
 
The PCPNDT (like the PDNT) does not limit  abortion directly, but, instead limits  only 
disclosure of information  about the future sex of the child.32  
 
III. Mapping Sex Selection 
Before we discuss our findings  regarding the impact of the Supreme Court’s decision, we 
briefly outline the history and current state of the Indian sex ratio crisis using data from 
the Indian Census.  Amartya Sen drew attention to the maltreatment of women by coining 
the phrase “missing  women.”33 This created a genre of studies that use sex ratios (the 
number of women to men in any given society) to calculate the number of missing 
women. While Sen intended the category to capture the many facets of inequality  women 
face, “missing  women” is more commonly  used to mean the number of aborted female 
fetuses. 
 
In the 1980s, estimates ranged from 100,000 to 220,000  “missing  women” annually in 
India. After 2000, some believed that anywhere from 300,000  to 700,000  women were 
“missing”  a year.34 There are large variations in these estimates due to different 
assumptions about the “normal” sex ratio, different mortality adjustments (including 
adjustments to account for reasons other than sex-selective abortion that impact 
imbalanced child sex ratios), and the use of different sources of data (e.g., the Indian 
census, the National Family Health Survey, or the Sample Registration System).35

  9 In India, sex ratios are calculated as the number of females for every 1000 males. We 
would expect to see at-birth sex ratios anywhere between 930 and 970 women to 1000 
men without any parental intervention.  Although most commentators blame sex-selective 
abortions for causing an imbalanced sex ratio, abortion is not responsible for the entire 
imbalance. The Guttmacher Institute report notes that ultrasounds can only reliably 
determine sex during the second trimester of pregnancy, but only 10–15% of all abortions 
are performed after the first trimester.36 The Indian census calculates only the child sex 
ratio, which is the ratio of girls to boy from birth to six years of ago.  Postnatal neglect of 
young female girls can also be a reason for excess female child mortality  and male-biased 
child sex ratios.37  
 
The child sex ratio in India in the 2011 Census was 914, which had dropped from 927 in 
the 2001 Census. Graph 1-1 depicts the sex ratio of the child sex ratio since 1951 in 
India.

Although the popular perception is that sex selection prevails throughout  all parts of the 
country, the reality is that there is great regional variation among Indian states and 
territories. According to the 2011 Indian Census, 10 states or territories had child sex

The child sex ratios in the states and territories have also changed over the course of 10 
years. Graph 1-3 below illustrates the changes in sex ratios from the 2001 to the 2011 
Indian Census. Child sex ratios improved in eight states, but none reached 950 except for 
Mizoram and Andaman & Nicobar Islands (which already had sex ratios above 950 in the 
2011 Indian Census). Table 1-1 in the Appendix of this Chapter lists the sex ratios in 
each Indian state and territory in 2001 and 2011.

we now describe the impact of the Supreme Court’s orders in the sex selection 
case. 
 
 
IV. Measuring the Impact of the Supreme Court Judgment 
 
The Supreme Court’s intervention  helped to push the Central Supervisory  Board, an 
institution  created pursuant to the PNDT, to propose amendments to the PNDT to account 
for new reproductive technologies that allowed people to preselect the future sex of their 
child and to improve enforcement mechanisms of the law (among other things).  
Parliament thereafter passed amendments to the PNDT.  
 
It is possible that the Parliament would have amended the PNDT without Supreme Court 
intervention.  Even though we cannot prove a casual connection between the Supreme 
Court’s intervention  and amendment of the PNDT, we can more firmly  conclude that the 
Court’s intervention  hastened the process of amendment.  The amendments were 
beneficial because they closed a number of loopholes,  increased penalties, and 
strengthened enforcement.  In addition,  the State governments were held to task by the 
Court.  They were asked to file compliance reports and encouraged to punish illegal 
ultrasound operators.  We do not have a way of determining  whether States actually 
increased compliance efforts during or after the period that the Supreme Court kept 
jurisdiction  over the case.   
 
Measuring impact in terms of the ultimate goals of the advocates, the Supreme Court’s 
intervention  was not successful. The end-goal of the advocates who brought the public 
interest litigation  in 2000 as well as the Supreme Court was to decrease the number of 
abortions of female fetuses. The litigants  hoped that by prodding  the Supreme Court, the 
Parliament would amend the law that banned sex determination  tests and would also 
encourage state governments to enforce the law.  Although the law was amended and 
perhaps implementation  efforts increased, there was no improvement  in the male-skewed 
sex ratio. 
 
It is obvious from Graph 1-1 that the child sex ratios continued to become more male-
skewed from the 2001 Indian Census to the 2011 Indian Census. While the Census 
measures changes over a 10-year period, the question that still remains is whether within 
that 10-year period there any improvements  in the number of female births. The unique 
data we use allows us to make observations year-by-year in regard to number of female 
births. We use data from two district level household  surveys (DLHS) of India, DLHS-2 
during 2002-2004  and DLHS-3 during 2007-2008.  The DLHS are large scale nationally 
representative cross-sectional household surveys covering all districts of India. The 
surveys covered 620,107 and 720,320 households respectively. The primary focus of the 
surveys was on reproductive,  maternal, and child health, including  pregnancy and 
  13 childbirth,  access to healthcare, child nutrition,  immunization,  and morbidity  and 
mortality  of household members. The primary survey respondents were married women 
of reproductive age (15-44 old women in DLHS-2 and 15-49 year old women in DLHS-
3).  
 
A household questionnaire  in the DLHS collected information  on the demographic and 
socioeconomic  characteristics, including  the location,  caste, religion  of the household, 
and age, sex, and educational attainment of each member. Standard of living  of the 
household was captured through the ownership of durable assets, such as TV, radio, 
bicycle, and car, and housing  and living  condition  indicators,  such as the availability  of 
toilets and kitchen, type of cooking fuel and lighting  source, and the quality  of building 
materials used. A separate questionnaire  for the respondent woman collected data on a 
complete lifetime birth history in DLHS-2, and a truncated birth history since January 
2004 in DLHS-3. Birth history data included information  on the date of birth, birth order, 
gender, and age at death (in case the child was not alive at the time of the survey) of 
children. Additional  information  on prenatal and postnatal care, pregnancy complications 
and outcomes was also collected.  
 
We examine the average annual probability  of female-births among all ever born children 
during two decades, 1989-2008.  From DLHS-2, we obtain data on children born during 
years 1989 to 2003, while DLHS-3 provides us childbirth  data during years 2004 to 2008. 
The sample sizes of children born during each year, along with the average and standard 
deviation  of the likelihood  of female births is presented in Table 1. The trend in the 
annual average female-birth rate over time is also presented in Figure 1.  
We find that the share of girls among newborn children has been consistently  declining 
over our study period, from 48.5% in 1989 to 42.9% in 2008. In comparison, the 
internationally  accepted normal male-to-female sex ratio (number of boys for each girl) at 
birth ranges between 930 and 970 girls per boys, which is equivalent to 49.2%–48.3% 
share of girls, respectively.  
 
We would expect that the Supreme Court’s efforts at pushing  the states to implement  the 
law, which commenced just after the petition was filed in 2000, would likely see positive 
gains in female births only after 2002. This would give time for the states to actually 
implement  and enforce the law and then it would take at least nine more months to see an 
impact on the rate of female births. However, there was a sharp decline during the period 
2002-2008,  which is preciously when we would expect to see the greatest impact of the 
Supreme Court’s interventions.

Several observable and unobservable socioeconomic factors and public  policies may 
determine the trend in female-birth probability  during our study period. For example, 
demographic transition or changes in income levels may lead to changes in the preference 
for sons over daughters,38 in turn leading more sex-selective abortion of girls. We can 
adjust the raw time trend shown in Figure 1 by removing the effect of various observable 
characteristics of the household,  parents, and the child in the following  way. 
 
We first create a pooled child-level  dataset (for all children born during1998  to 2008) 
from DLHS-2 and DLHS-3. Then, a state fixed-effect linear regression of the following 
form is estimated: 
 
𝑭𝒆𝒎𝒂𝒍𝒆 = 𝜶 +𝜷𝑺𝒕𝒂𝒕𝒆 +𝜸𝑿 + 𝝐           (𝟏)   
𝒊𝒕 𝒊 𝒊𝒕 𝒊𝒕
for the i-th child born in year t. The outcome variable 𝐹𝑒𝑚𝑎𝑙𝑒 = 1 if the newborn child  
𝑖𝑡
is a girl, and 0 otherwise. 𝑆𝑡𝑎𝑡𝑒  denotes a set of appropriate number of dummy variables 
𝑖
for states, and 𝑋  is a vector of background characteristics of the household,  parents, and 
𝑖𝑡
the newborn child. Included in 𝑋  are the indicators of location  (rural or urban), and 
𝑖𝑡
caste (scheduled caste, scheduled tribe, or other backward classes), religion  (Hindu, 
Muslim,  or Sikh), and age and gender of the household head. Among parental and child 
characteristics, we include indicators of various levels of education (grades 1-5, 6-11, and 
12 and above completed) of the mother and father, mother’s age, and the newborn child’s 
birth order in 𝑋 . We control for the standard of living  of the household  by first 
𝑖𝑡
constructing a composite index of asset ownership (e.g. radio, sewing machine, TV, 
bicycle, car) and living  condition  (e.g. construction  quality, availability  of toilet and 
electricity, sources of drinking  water) using principal-component  method.39 The index is 
then divided into five quintiles  and indicators of the top four quintiles  are included in 𝑋 .  
𝑖𝑡
 
𝜖  is the error term of the regression. We cluster all standard errors at the district level. 
𝑖𝑡
The estimated residual error of the regression, 𝜖̂, will therefore include factors that are not 
incorporated in our analysis, including  unobservable household and community 
characteristics and public policies  that may affect the secular trend in the female-birth 
probability.   
 
Figure 2 shows the time trend of residual probability  of female-birth obtained from the 
regression. We find the residual probability  to remain fairly stable with a very slight 
downward trend over our study period. Therefore, we can argue that the Supreme Court

Even if there has been any positive  effect that remains undetected in our data, it is clearly 
not enough to reduce the male bias in the sex ratio. Female births continued to decrease 
and decreased most sharply during the time we would expect the Supreme Court’s efforts 
to have had the most impact from 2002 to 2008.  Thus, examining  only the sex ratio, we 
are left with the impression  that at least in regard to the practice of sex-selective abortion, 
the Supreme Court’s intervention  did little to curb the behavior it wanted to prevent.  
 
V. Why the Supreme Court’s Intervention Did not Normalize Sex Ratios? 
 
  As noted above, the Supreme Court’s intervention  and indeed even the 
Parliament’s intervention  was not successful in normalizing  the sex ratios.  Quite the 
contrary, the number of female births as compared to all births decreased. Of course, we 
cannot rule out the possibility  that the number of female births could be even lower had 
the Supreme Court not intervened.40  In this section, we discuss some of the factors that 
may help explain why the Supreme Court’s order and even an act of Parliament could not 
prevent the women who selectively aborted female fetuses from doing so.  First, the 
desire of families to have at least one son is a deep-seated cultural norm in many parts of 
India. This view combined with changing macro-economic factors that lead to a desire 
for smaller families often pushes people to elect selective abortion. People in society are 
more likely to resist laws that go against cultural norms than laws that support the 
mainstream view.  Second, the behavior that the government has made illegal  (e.g., 
disclosing  the future sex of a fetus) is difficult  to regulate. It can occur within the privacy 
of a doctor’s office and people can also gain this information  through non-licensed 
operators of ultrasound machines.  
 
Families Desire Both At least one Son and Smaller Family Sizes 
 
Both in the popular imagination  and in scholarly work, “culture” is often used to explain 
the widespread practice of sex-selective abortion.41 This is often disaggregated into a list 
of evils in society that essentially place women in an inferior position  to men. First, 
                                                             
40 Indeed, one of the co-authors (Nandi) has found in another article that the sex ratios in 
one state (i.e., Maharashtra) that banned sex determination  tests before any other state 
were less male-skewed than the sex ratios in neighboring  states that had not adopted 
bans.

  18 patrilocal marriages, where a couple settles into the husband’s family’s home, are the 
norm and are often used to explain “son-preference.” As a result of this custom, a 
daughter is thought to be paraya dhan (someone else’s wealth). Sons are the ones who 
are assumed to be breadwinners for the families. A lack of a pension system in India 
leads parents to rely on the son to provide financial support during old age. On the other 
hand, there are strong norms against families taking money or any support from a married 
daughter. To the extent a woman earns an income outside of her household,  she will often 
be expected to keep her earnings within the husband’s family. For wealthier families, 
they desire sons because they do not want to share their wealth with daughters who will 
leave the natal home in the patrilocal system. 
 
Second, dowry is another explanation  for sex selection, and this flows directly from the 
British colonial  accounts. Indeed, this factor still remains one of the most cited 
explanation  for sex selection. Although dowry is prohibited  under the Dowry Prohibition 
Act of 1961, the practice continues today.42 As a result, when a woman gets married, her 
parents often have to pay money (sometimes large sums in relation to their income) to the 
groom’s family. For poor parents, having to provide a dowry when a daughter marries is 
often economically  challenging.   
 
Third, for wealthier families, while dowry may not be as much of a burden, parents may 
desire sons to perpetuate their family name and the sons will be the ones that parents 
leave their money to. Fourth, one Hindu religious  tradition is often attributed as a cause 
for sex selection in favor of boys—many Hindus believe that only sons should light the 
funeral pyre of their parents. Others believe that moksha (liberation from rebirth or 
reincarnation) is only possible through their sons.43 
 
Fifth, another factor often cited is the low status of women, which occurs, among other 
things, because they lack opportunities  for paid work (and their unpaid work is not 
valued) and generally do not own property. In many places, women do not have 
economic opportunities  or are not permitted to work outside of the home. Although 
inheritance laws have been reformed, a daughter is often expected to give up her rights to 
her parents’ property in favor of her brothers.44 An Indian government agency has 
pointed out that in India women own just 10.9 percent of the land.45 This is because even

  19 when they have a right on paper to inherit property, this right gets subverted in a variety 
of ways. Members of their natal family including  brothers are thus able to persuade them 
or coerce them to relinquish  their share in the family property.46   
 
All of these factors are summarized in the literature as follows:  Girls are an economic 
liability  to a family,  while boys are economic assets. Technology facilitates people’s 
desires to have sons by allowing  them to determine the sex of the fetus and abort it if it is 
a girl.   
 
However, a more nuanced interpretation  of the data suggests that Indian people by and 
large do not have an aversion to having daughters, but want to have at least one son. Birth 
parity studies from India show that the sex ratio of the first birth of Indian children is 
skewed in favor of males, but gets progressively  worse at second and third parities for 
parents who have no prior sons. In analyzing  a survey of over 1 million  households in 
India conducted in 1998, Prabhat Jha and his co-authors found that the sex ratio for the 
first child is 871 females to 1000 males (recall that the standard range is considered to be 
from 930 to 970 females for every 1000 males).47 But in the second birth parity for 
parents with no prior son, the sex ratio was 759 per 1000 males; and the ratio decreased 
in the third birth parity to 719 per 1000 males for parents with no prior sons.48 Thus, a 
great proportion  of parents who already have one or two daughters and have no sons are 
intervening  to ensure the birth of a son, whereas a fewer proportion  of parents are 
intervening  at the first births (and are willing  to have a daughter).  
 
Qualitative studies by Tulsi Patel confirm this view. She states that “female foeticide is 
not approved and/or practised for the first female foetus.”49 Thus, just because son-
preference may be widespread, it does not also mean that “daughter-aversion” is also  
widespread.50 Survey results also support the view that the two-child household  is the

  20 accepted norm and that there is no aversion to having at least one daughter. The Lawyers 
Collective surveyed 168 households across Delhi51 and found that an overwhelming 
majority  of women (79%) said that two would be the ideal number of children.52 While 
60% of the women said that one male child was ideal, the same percentage said that one 
female child is ideal. Taken together, it appears that for the women surveyed, the ideal 
family is two children:  one boy and one girl. This “micro-study”  also found that parents 
who were married for less than five years had sex ratios that were female-skewed, and 
these sex ratios became more male-skewed as their time of marriage increased. This 
again supports the view that parents are willing  to have girls, but want to have at least one 
son.  
 
In Jha’s study, we see that a very small number of parents with one or two boy children 
may actually be selecting for girls. Jha’s study finds that the sex ratio of the second child 
of mothers who have one prior boy is 1102 females per 1000 males, and the sex ratio of 
the third child of mothers who have two prior boys is 1176.53 These sex ratios are slightly 
female-skewed (they are above the standard range of 930–970 females to 1,000 males). 
Yet, the proportion  of parents with boy children that practice female-biased sex selection 
is much lower than the proportion  of parents with girl children that practice male-biased 
sex selection. 
 
A new and growing desire of people to have small families when taken together with the 
desire to have at least one son leads some women to selectively  terminate their 
pregnancies.54 The United Nations Population  Division  estimated that the fertility  rate in 
the 1950s was 5.9 children per woman in India, not as high as in many other developing 
countries at the time where the average was often seven children or more.55 By 2009, 
fertility  in India had declined to 2.6 children per woman, less than half the rate of the 
early 1950s. There are a host of reasons for the desire for smaller family sizes. Some 
argue that as there is a reduction in agrarian modes of production  (where the labor of

  21 children might have been important),  people are having fewer children.56 In urban areas, 
increasing prices and cost of living  influence people to have smaller families.57    
 
Another reason for the changing family size norms has to do with the governmental 
policies in India. While most people know about China’s one-child policy (which it 
recently announced it will change),58 few are aware of the coercive policies adopted by 
Indian state governments to enforce a two-child norm model. In pursuit of the goal of 
smaller families,  certain states have adopted prohibitions  barring people with more than 
two children from holding  posts in local governing bodies. Currently, the two-child norm 
is a part of the population  policies  in Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, and 
Maharashtra.59  
 
The Indian Supreme Court has found that the two-child norm in the Haryana Panchayati 
Raj Act, 1994 did not violate the constitution.  The Court held that the “disqualification  on 
the right to contest an election by having more than two living  children does not 
contravene any fundamental right nor does it cross the limits  of reasonability.  Rather it is 
a disqualification  conceptually  devised in the national interest.”60 Thus, a person’s right 
to have children can be restricted in favor of the larger goal of population  control. In 
upholding  two-child norm policies,  the Supreme Court may have unintentionally 
undermined efforts to curb sex selection. By forcing families to have no more than two 
children,  some may sex select to ensure that one of their children is a male. 
 
Challenges in Enforcing the PCPNDT 
 
There are several reasons for the failure of the PCPNDT to reduce sex-selective 
abortions. First, it is inherently  difficult  to enforce the PCPNDT. Ultrasound technology 
is not completely banned under the law and on the contrary, they are now a common part 
of pre-natal care practices. They can be used to detect the sex of the fetus. It is difficult  to 
prevent medical professionals from conveying the sex of fetuses in the privacy of their 
patient rooms. Indeed, medical professionals who convey the sex of the fetus do so in 
coded terms.

  22 Additionally,  while licensed medical professionals using registered ultrasound equipment 
can illegally  disclose information  about the future sex of the fetus, there are also 
unlicensed people using unregistered ultrasounds for the purposes of sex determination. 
A robust black market for sex determination  and sex-selective abortions has developed.   
 
We have presented two potential factors that explain why it is difficult  for the Supreme 
Court and even for an act of Parliament to prohibit  sex-selective termination  of 
pregnancies. The demand for reducing family size while at the same time having a male 
heir is strong in parts of India. At the same time, the illegal  activities occur in private and 
the law is easy to evade – it requires only access to an ultrasound machine.   
 
Conclusion 
 
The child sex ratio became starkly more male-skewed starting in the 1980s in India. 
Technology that gave pregnant women information  about the sex of their fetuses became 
widespread. A desire by many parents to have at least one male child,  while at the same 
time wanting to have a fewer number of children (than their predecessors) all led to many 
women to abort female fetuses. In 1994, Parliament reacted by (among other things) 
prohibiting  medical professionals from revealing to pregnant women the sex of their 
fetuses.  This law to prevent sex determination  went into effect in 1996. Four years later, 
a group of litigants  brought a public  interest litigation  to the Supreme Court arguing that 
the State governments had to yet to implement  the law by appointing  authorities to 
enforce it. The Supreme Court kept jurisdiction  for three years in this case and in those 
three years, a panel of three judges led primarily  by Justice Shah focused attention of 
State and Union governments to the problem of the widespread selective abortion of 
female fetuses.  
 
In a dialogue that lasted nearly three years with the State governments and the Union 
government, the Supreme Court hauled into its courtroom in New Delhi representatives 
from State governments and Union government to question them about enforcement of 
the legislation.  The Supreme Court also demanded that the State government 
representatives file compliance reports and called out by name those governments that 
had failed to file such reports on a timely basis.  In addition,  the Supreme Court ordered 
the body that was appointed pursuant to the legislation  that banned sex determination 
tests to consider amendments to the law that would places restrictions on using newly 
emerging technology  for the purposes of preselecting the sex of a child.  
 
During the time period that the Supreme Court kept jurisdiction  in this case, transcripts of 
discussions in the Rajya Sabha reveal an acute sense of awareness of the orders of the 
Supreme Court.  Indeed, amendments were drafted by the Central Supervisory Board  
and were eventually  enacted by the Parliament. Thus, the Supreme Court’s prodding 
certainly hastened the process of strengthening the legislation  aimed at curbing sex-
selective abortions. 
 
However, an analysis of unique annual sex ratio data over from 1998 to 2008 reveals that 
  23 the Court decision was not associated with any improvements  in the relative number of 
female births. On the contrary, there was a sharp decline in the number of females born 
exactly when we would expect the Supreme Court’s interventions  to have had the most 
impact. Indeed, even the legislation  did not work to prevent sex ratios from becoming 
more male-skewed.  This is because it is very difficult  to regulate activity that occurs 
within the privacy of a medical professional’s office, to prevent illegal  operators from 
providing  a service that is highly  in demand, and to change the views of people who 
believe that their families will not be complete without  at least one male child.  Thus, the 
PIL was successful in pushing for law reform, but was not able to impact social change.
