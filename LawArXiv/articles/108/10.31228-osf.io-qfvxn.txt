“The Expanding First Amendment” in an Age of 
Free Speech Paradox 
PETER M. SHANE* 
Ours is an age of intensifying free speech paradox. It has never been easier 
for individuals to find platforms from which to communicate pretty much 
anything at all to an audience of potentially global reach.1 Yet daily news reports 
and  punditry  register  the  complaints  of  Americans  who  believe  their 
opportunities for free expression are being squelched.2 
The paradox is replicated in the domain of law. As several authors in this 
Symposium Issue explain, the Supreme Court in recent years has broadened the 
domain of communicative activity covered by the First Amendment’s “speech” 
protection and has limited in other ways the capacity of government to regulate 
communication  based  on  content3—hence,  the  Symposium  title,  “The 
Expanding First Amendment.” But in terms of felt experience, many Americans 
perceive that their capacity to speak freely is increasingly being imperiled in 
ways for which they have no legal recourse.4

tandem with the many enduring legacy tools of personal and mass communication, the 
information  and  communication  technologies  (ICTs)  of  the  digital  age  can  promote 
knowledge and the exchange of ideas to a degree never before imagined.”).

The sources of this paradox are manifold, but none is more consequential 
than the revolution in digital communications. The First Amendment, of course, 
applies only to government regulation of speech, not to the capacity of private 
entities to control (or fail to control) speech that occurs within private domains.5 
Social media comprise the venues for most of our communications explosion, 
but the electronic public square is overwhelmingly in private hands. These 
powerful private entities, unlike the government, are legally entitled to censor 
speech on their platforms, and do so.6  
The flip side of that phenomenon is that private web hosts have no legal 
obligation to deny a forum for communications that others may find offensive 
or intimidating. Thus, at the same time that digital technologies (along with 
print, broadcast, and cable) provide unprecedented opportunities for people to 
share provocative views, many people may find that they enter public debate 
only at risk of unleashing a torrent of personal attack that may be a source of 
embarrassment or worse. It is common for journalists and academics, as well as 
athletes and performing artists who publicly articulate controversial positions, 
to face threats to life and livelihood, as well as other forms of ridicule and 
abuse.7 The effect of massive volumes of vituperative, but constitutionally-

protected speech, in discouraging public debate is not literally censorship, but 
arguably as chilling as any government regulation. 
It is also not quite accurate that First Amendment doctrine is expanding 
uniformly.8 For example, when government acts as an employer, many of the 
protections that usually exist against government regulation simply do not 
apply.  In  Garcetti  v.  Ceballos,  the  Roberts  Court  held:  “[W]hen  public 
employees make statements pursuant to their official duties, the employees are 
not speaking as citizens for First Amendment purposes, and the Constitution 
does not insulate their communications from employer discipline.”9 This is true 
even in a case, like Garcetti, where the speech involves a significant and 
nonpublic allegation of corruption.10 It is plainly consequential for the Trump 
Administration, which has triggered widespread reports of a clampdown on 
public communications by federal employees.11 
Amid this clash of competing forces, predicting either the likely or preferred 
course of First Amendment development is hardly an easy task. At one level, as 
Professor Ashutosh Bhagwat argues, it is not sustainable for the Court to treat 
as protected speech every form of human activity that has an expressive 
component.12  When  the  Court  changed  its  mind  in  the  1970s  about  the 
availability of First Amendment protection for commercial speech,13 it had a 
profound effect on the capacity of elected officials to regulate commercial

activity. Extending constitutional protection to election finance14 or treating 
cable system owners as “editors” of the speech they transmit15 are decisions 
with  profound  consequences  for  the  legitimate  range  of  collective  self-
governance. If, as Professor Tabatha Abu El-Haj argues, the First Amendment 
was intended to support freedom for, not just freedom from, democratic self-
governance,16  the  boundless  extension  of  First  Amendment  protection  to 
everything  people  do  that  partakes  of  communication  would  be 
counterproductive; as citizens, we would find ourselves severely hobbled in 
efforts to advance the public good through democratic lawmaking. 
This dilemma may well come to a head where First Amendment claims 
intersect with arguments based on the Second Amendment. Courts have held 
that the Second Amendment does not require government across-the-board to 
permit the open carriage of firearms,17 even though “open carry” may well have 
an expressive component. For many in the “audience” of open carry, however, 
the message received is one of intimidation, thus potentially chilling their 
expression and raising the question whether the expressive content of open carry 
weakens or actually strengthens the case for government regulation. It is 
noteworthy, for example, that the American Civil Liberties Union—long a 
stalwart institutional defender of free speech rights even for widely despised 
groups and individuals—now eschews the defense of groups seeking to stage 
protest demonstrations with firearms.18  
Even if the Supreme Court declines to extend free speech protection to the 
expressive activity of open carry, however, the Court is unlikely to revert to 
speech protection only for actual speech in other contexts. The appeal of 
democracy lies not only in opportunities for collective decision-making, but also 
in the experience of individual men and women exercising autonomy in their 
own  lives,  including  the  control  of  their  information-related  or  otherwise 
expressive activities.19 Broad readings of the First Amendment can enhance that 
experience  of  autonomy.  Thus,  Professor  Jane  Bambauer  argues  for  the

importance  of  expanding  First  Amendment  protection  for  activities  of 
experimentation  and  information-gathering,20  and  Professor  Timothy  Zick 
urges us not to be reflexively dismissive of novel First Amendment claims on 
behalf, for example, of transgender access to public facilities.21 In terms of the 
“lived experience” of free expression, these positions are hardly without appeal. 
And if this complexity were not dizzying enough, finding the proper 
normative stance on First Amendment doctrine is complicated further by the 
realities of social, economic, and political power. The risks and rewards of 
expanding or restricting free speech rights are typically not distributed at 
random across the population. The right to spend unlimited personal funds on 
election campaigns is not of equal benefit to both rich and poor. Should online 
commercial  platforms  receive  First  Amendment  protection  against  the 
imposition  of  antidiscrimination  laws,  the  burdens  of  any  resulting 
discrimination in the provision of services will inevitably fall more heavily on 
racial minorities and LGBT individuals.22 If drug companies are allowed to 
market pharmaceuticals for unproven off-label uses, those with fewer resources 
to conduct their own product research or to withstand the economic loss of funds 
wasted on misguided purchases will suffer more.23 
Yet, any doctrinal project of trying to advance social equality by curtailing 
free speech rights would surely be fraught. The most compelling argument 
against permitting government rules against hate speech is “the worry that those 
who  create  and  enforce  content-based  speech  restrictions  will  do  so 
incompetently  or  abusively.”24  This  danger  would  exist  even  among 
government officials who are sincerely committed to impartiality as a norm of 
democratic governance. But witnessing the head of the federal executive branch
