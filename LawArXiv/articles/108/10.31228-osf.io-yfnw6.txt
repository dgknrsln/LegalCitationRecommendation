THE NECESSITY OF PLEADING ELEMENTS IN
PRIVATE ANTITRUST  CONSPIRACY CLAIMS

I.  INTRODUCTION
The use of private  actions to vindicate public  rights is a perplexing
difficulty  in  the  enforcement  of laws  relating  to  economic  regulation.
Private  antitrust enforcement  presents  a  particularly  dramatic  example-
one that has captivated scholars for decades,  and which remains  a subject
of vociferous debate.'  The challenge  is an institutional  one.  At bottom,
private antitrust enforcement presents the danger of incentives misaligned

1. The extent of the appropriate remedy for a private suit is one area of debate.  See,
e.g.,  HERBERT  HOVENKAMP,  THE  ANTITRUST  ENTERPRISE  (2005);  RICHARD  POSNER,
ANTITRUST LAW (2d ed.) (2002); Robert H. Lande, Five Myths About Antitrust Damages, 40
U.S.F. L. REV.  651,  651  (2006) (attacking  the conventional  wisdom that treble damages
remedies over-deter);  William H. Page, The Scope of Liabilityf or Antitrust Violations, 37
STAN.  L.  REV.  1445,  1450-52  (1985)  (demonstrating  that  optimal  deterrence  analysis
supports treble damages liability in conjunction with procedural  limitations on suit).  That
debate  assumes meritorious claims.  Another difficulty is the danger of non-meritorious
strike  suits.  See, e.g.,  William H.  Wagener, Note, Modeling the Effect  of One-Way Fee
Shifting on Discovery Abuse in Private Antitrust Litigation, 78 N.Y.U. L. REV.  1887,  1891-
93,  1921  (2003).  Cf  Posner, supra, at 275  & n.8  (noting the  "class  action  extortion"
problem).  On the other hand, commentators have emphasized the importance of the private
suit in the overall  enforcement scheme.  See generally Steven  C. Salop  & Lawrence  J.
White, Economic Analysis ofPrivate Antitrust Litigation, 74 GEO. L.J. 1001,  1001 & nn.1-3

from  the  rationales  for  antitrust  enforcement.2   The  solution  is  a
combination  of substantive  and  procedural  refinements  to  realign  the
incentives.3
On the substantive side, courts and scholars have long recognized that
parallel conduct by horizontal  competitors-those  competing  in the same
geographic  and product  markets  and  at  the  same  level  of the  chain  of
distribution-does  not  raise  red  flags  about  the  possibility  of  illegal
concerted action.4  That understanding  underlies decades of Supreme Court
precedent,  dating back at least to the opinion  of Justice  Clark in  Theatre
Enterprises, Inc. v.  Paramount Film Distribution Corp.,' and continuing
through cases  such  as Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. v.  Zenith Radio
Corp.,6 Brooke Group Ltd. v. Brown &  Williamson Tobacco Corp.,' and
most recently, Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly.8  According to the Court in
Matsushita, Sherman  One  requires  a  theory  of the  plaintiffs  case  that
"tends  to  exclude  the  possibility  that  the  alleged  conspirators  acted
independently."9  The more recent decisions also recognize another reality
that has informed antitrust decision-making  since at least the neo-classical
economic  revolution  in the  field beginning  in the  1960's.  Litigation  in
general, but especially onerous, complex litigation that characterizes most
private-plaintiff  suits  under  section  1 of the  Sherman  Act,1°  can be a
massive  expenditure of productive  resources.  It  is dead-weight  loss that
cannot be justified if the conduct complained of is most likely innocent.1
Procedural issues regarding private plaintiffs'  access to courts arise as
well.  The  well-understood  substantive  principles  regarding  antitrust
conspiracies are met with equally well-known dictum regarding the method

from Fantasy, 3-4 (AEI-Brookings Joint Center for Regulatory Studies, Related Publ'n 06-

or compensation, the twin goals of private antitrust enforcement the loss is justifiable.  See
Huffman, supra note 2, at 107.  There is reason to be skeptical on that front, however.  See
infra Part III.A.2008] PRIVATE ANTITRUST CONSPIRACY CLAIMS
of pleading  cases  in  federal  court.  Justice  Black in  Conley v.  Gibson12
placed a gloss on Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8,"3 holding that so long
as any statement of facts could be proved consistent with the allegations a
plaintiff made in  its complaint, the complaint  was sufficient to  survive  a
motion to dismiss.  That rule-itself a staple of Supreme  Court doctrine,
and reaffirmed  recently  in cases  such as  Leatherman v.  Tarrant County
Narcotics Intelligence & Coordination Unit4 and Swierkiewicz v. Sorema
N.A."5-- could,  if  taken  literally,  have  extraordinary  and  far-reaching
consequences.  A  plaintiff  could  plead  that  "the  sky  is  blue,"  and
nonetheless be  entitled to discovery,  because it  is possible to prove  facts
consistent with the sky being blue that would provide a basis for relief.6
There  is  obvious  tension  between  concerns  for  false  positives  in
private Sherman One suits and traditional understandings of ease of access
to  courts  for  private  plaintiffs.  That  tension  presents  certain  neat
coincidences.  The modern conceptions  of both  schemes,  tracing back to
Theatre Enterprises and  Conley,  are  both  creatures  of the  last  half-
century."  Both  schemes  provide  mechanisms-one  procedural,  one
substantive-meant to  compensate  for injury and deter injurious conduct.
Both present dangers of abuse that can summon drastic social ills.  But the
two schemes also dovetail neatly in a demonstration of Sir Henry Maine's
famous  statement  that  "substantive  law  has  at  first  the  look  of being
gradually  secreted  in  the  interstices  of  procedure."'"  Together,  they

1668 (1998)  (noting that "literal compliance with Conley" could consist of nothing more
than the parties' names and a prayer for relief).  Such a literal interpretation is, of course, a
reductio ad absurdum of the language the Court employed in Conley. See Conley, 355 U.S.
41, 45 (stating that a complaint should not be dismissed for failing to state a claim unless it
appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts).
It also fails to heed the text of Rule 8 and writes out of the rule the power expressly granted
to federal  trial courts to dismiss plaintiffs'  suits for "failure  to state a claim upon which
relief can be granted."  FED.  R. Civ. P.  12(b)(6).  On the other hand, Professor Thomas
argues  carefully  that the  open-door  approach  to pleading  followed  by  the  more liberal
understanding  of  Conley  is  commanded  by  the  Seventh  Amendment  to  the  U.S.
Constitution.  See Suja Thomas, Why the Motion to Dismiss is Now Unconstitutional,M  INN.

prescribe the means by which potentially meritorious antitrust litigation can
proceed to discovery and trial.  The two schemes also permit litigation that
is  not based on any reasonable  belief of wrongful  conduct to be  stopped
before excessive waste occurs.
The  Supreme  Court  in  2007  again  affirmed  the  Rule  8  pleading
standard and the principles underlying Theatre Enterprisesa nd its progeny.
In Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly,'9 the Court demonstrated that a middle
ground exists in which the liberal pleading standard can be reconciled with
the  conservative  substantive  legal  rule.  Twombly  has been  called  the
sleeper case  of the 2006 Supreme Court term.20  The reaction to Twombly
was immediate  and vociferous,  with courts re-evaluating their approaches
to motions to  dismiss2' and many scholars expressing  their views that the
Court's interpretation of Rule 8 is an abandonment of the Conley rule.22
The  interplay  between  Rule  8 and the  requirements  for  proving  a
conspiracy  under  Sherman  One  came  before  the  federal  courts  in  the
context  of a  private  antitrust  suit  brought  by  end-user  consumers  that
alleged  a  conspiracy  among  providers  of  local  telephone  and  internet
services. 23 The  plaintiffs  argued  that  the  defendants  conspired  both  to
prevent entry by other competitors  into their respective  service  areas and
not  to  enter  into  each  others'  service  areas  in  competition  with  one
another.24  The  result,  according  to  plaintiffs,  was  that  the  petitioners
maintained  monopolies  in  their  geographic  markets,  causing  injury  to
consumers."s  The allegations made in Twombly, if proved, would represent
per se violations of Sherman One, and give rise to treble damages liability
in a civil suit and jail time and criminal fines in a criminal proceeding.26

The local telephone industry at issue in Twombly has been marked by
a  complex  history  of  regulated  monopoly  and,  since  1996,  torturous
attempts at  deregulation.2 The petitioners'  respective  "service  markets"
' 
are  the  result  of  historical  accident.  Before  February  8,  1996,  when
President  Clinton  signed  the  Telecommunications  Act  of  1996,28  the
monopolies in those markets were protected by state law.29  The patchwork
of monopoly in local service areas traces itself to another massive antitrust
suit, that one brought by the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of
Justice  against  the  American  Telephone  and  Telegraph  Company.  The
parties settled that suit in 1982 with a consent decree, and two years later,
under Judge  Green's  Modified  Final Judgment,30  AT&T  divested  all  its
local telephony  assets by spinning off the seven Baby Bells.  A  series of
mergers  among  the  Baby  Bells  produced  four  remaining  competitors:
BellSouth  Corporation,  SBC  Communications,  Inc.,  Qwest
Communications International,  Inc. and Verizon Communications,  Inc., the
defendants in Twombly.31
Deregulation in local telephony had the effect of creating two business
models for firms seeking to provide  local telecom services.  One model is
that  of  the  traditional  local  telephone  provider-the  incumbent  Baby
Bells-which  are  commonly  referred  to  as  Incumbent  Local  Exchange
Carriers  (ILECs).  Prior  to  deregulation,  those  providers  maintained
exclusive franchises in particular regions under state law.  ILECs own and

has been as  ill-prepared  to move  from regulated  monopoly  to competition  as the  local
telephone industry."  Robert W. Crandall, Are We Deregulating Telephone Services? Think

provide service using their local networks.32  The other business model is a
class  of  competitors  known  as  Competitive  Local  Exchange  Carriers
(CLECs) that seek to serve customers in competition  with the ILECs now
that the local  markets  have been  opened to competition.  CLECs  usually
compete by leasing network space  from ILECs at rates prescribed by the
Telecommunications  Act  of 1996.3'  The  Twombly plaintiffs  alleged that
but for a  conspiracy  on the  part of the ILEC  defendants,  CLECs  would
have  entered  into  competition  on a  larger  scale,  and  ILECs  would  have
entered as CLECs into each others'  territories.  The resulting competition,
according to plaintiffs, would have produced lower prices for consumers.34
Alleging a class of all users of local telephone and internet service from the
passage  of the  Telecommunications  Act  until  the  time  of  filing  suit,
plaintiffs sought treble damages relief for the alleged harm.35
The trial court dismissed plaintiffs' complaint.  In doing so, the court
viewed  the  Rule  8(a)(2)  pleading  standard  through  the  lens  of  the
substantive  Sherman One cause of action.36  Because  "the Supreme  Court
has never held that proof of parallel business behavior . . . itself constitutes
a  Sherman  Act offense,"  the  court noted its responsibility to "distinguish
between  conduct  that represents  the natural convergence  of competitors'
market behavior,  and conduct that appears to have been taken pursuant to
an agreement.,,37  The court then turned to the "plus factor" framework that
courts  of  appeals  widely  regard  as  defining  the  distinction  between
innocent  parallel  conduct  and circumstantial  evidence  of conspiracy.  It
held the plus factors were shorthand for plaintiffs'  responsibility to "assert
facts that, if true, support the existence of a conspiracy."38
The district court held the specific allegations  of the complaint were
insufficient to amount to allegations of a conspiracy.39  While the plaintiffs
alleged that the defendants'  territorial markets appeared gerrymandered, the
court observed that was the result of historical accident.  Parallel refusal to
be hospitable  to entry by CLECs would be in each ILEC's unilateral best
interest.  Parallel conduct in not entering into competition with one another

was  explainable  by  the  fundamentally  different  nature  of the  CLEC
business model ("essentially middlemen, buying network time from ILECs
.. . and  selling  it  for a  profit") from  the  ILEC  business  model.40   One
specific allegation was of a quote by one defendant's CEO.  The court held
that the quote must be taken in the context in which it was made.  Viewed
in context, the quote spoke only to the defendant company's unilateral best
interest.4'  Finally, the court rejected an allegation that the defendants had
conspired  because  it was  conclusory.  A  unanimous panel  of the  Second
Circuit  reversed,  holding  that  the  Conley  standard  commanded  the
conclusion  that  factual  allegations  that  were  ambiguous  as  to  whether
conduct  was  legitimate  or illegal  were sufficient  to  survive  a motion  to
42
dismiss.
The Second Circuit applied more formalistically the rule that "a  court
would  have to conclude that there is  no set of facts  that would  permit a
plaintiff to demonstrate  that the particular parallelism  was the  product of
collusion  rather than coincidence.'43  That standard  was easily met by the
plaintiffs'  complaint  in  Twombly.  It  was  possible,  for  example,  that
observed parallel conduct in  failing to enter other ILECs'  service  areas as
CLECs was the result of a market division agreement.  It was possible that
observed parallel inhospitality to entry by CLECs reflected a conspiracy to
maintain the oligopoly to which the ILECs had grown accustomed.
So long as a conspiracy is "among the realm of plausible possibilities"
from  the  complaint's  allegations-which  clearly  it  was,  and  would  be
except in the truly marginal circumstance-a court should deny a motion to
dismiss.44  The court  of appeals  acknowledged  the  Supreme Court's rule
that to survive summary judgment, a Sherman  One plaintiff must provide
evidence  "'that  tends  to  exclude  the  possibility'  that  the  alleged
conspirators acted independently.'45  But it concluded that the Matsushita
rule applied only at the summary judgment stage of proceedings.

approach  to  pleading.  The  district  court  stated  that  its  holding  "is
somewhat  in  tension  with  Federal  Rule  of  Civil  Procedure  8, which
requires  only  a  'short  and  plain  statement  of the  claim,'  and  allows
plaintiffs to base their complaints on statements of ultimate facts.''46 For its
part, the Second Circuit recognized:
that  a  balance  is  being  struck  here,  that  on  one  side  of that
balance  is  the  sometimes  colossal  expense  of  undergoing
discovery,  that  such costs themselves  likely lead defendants  to
pay  plaintiffs  to  settle  what  would  ultimately  be  shown  to  be
meritless  claims,  that  the  success  of such  meritless  claims
encourages others to be brought, and that the overall result may
well be  a  burden  on the  courts  and a  deleterious effect on the
manner  in  which  and  efficiency  with  which  business  is
conducted.47
The Supreme Court reversed the Second Circuit, holding in an opinion
by Justice Souter that the complaint did not contain enough facts to cross
the line from  a mere possibility of illegal conspiratorial  activity  into the
arena  of "plausibility. 4'8  Rather than making  any  effort to  reconcile the
tension between Rule 8 and the leading case interpreting the rule, Conley,
and what it concluded was the need to protect defendants against frivolous
antitrust litigation, the Court simply wrote the heart of Conley out of the
books.  Perhaps  the most  remarkable  for having been penned by Justice
Souter,  one of the  Court's more liberal members,  the Court held that the
famous  "no  state  of  facts"  standard  from  Conley  "after  puzzling  the
profession for 50 years ...  has earned its retirement. ,41
This Article undertakes  a positivist justification of the rule announced
in Twombly.  Part II concentrates on the procedural questions that arise at
the motion to dismiss stage of litigation.  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8
codifies a standard of pleading under which complaints must both provide
proper  notice  to  the  defendants-a  universally  accepted  basis  for  the
pleading requirement-and  show pleaders'  entitlement to relief-a much
more controversial  proposition.50  The "notice"  requirement  is not terribly

their discretion to do "justice."52
Part III examines the implications for the private Sherman One claim
of the new understanding  of Rule  8.  Viewing  the pleading  requirement
through  the  lens  of  the  governing  substantive  law,  in  order  to  plead
Sherman  One  properly  a  plaintiffs  factual  allegations  must  create  an
inference of a conspiracy.  To survive a motion to dismiss, a plaintiff must
plead plus factors, which are facts "tending to exclude the possibility"53 that
each  defendant  acted  in its unilateral  best  interest.  Couching plaintiffs'
pleading  responsibility  in this manner makes clear that  the Twombly  rule
does not apply uniquely to Sherman One litigation.  It is trans-substantive.
It is the substantively complex nature of the Sherman One claim that gives
rise to any particular difficulties for private litigants.54  Part II continues to
consider anecdotes of pleading practice in the Sherman One context in the
lower courts since Twombly.
II.  THE FEDERAL PLEADING AND DISMISSAL SCHEME
Rule  8  controls  the  sufficiency  of plaintiffs'  statement  of claims.55
Together with Rule 12(b)(6),  it provides a mechanism for courts to dismiss
claims.56   The  rules  require  courts  to  construe  pleadings  "so  as  to  do
justice."57   The  standards  exist  to  accomplish  two  primary  ends.  They
mitigate the concern that a defendant-much  like Kafka's character Josef
K.-might be subjected to defending against suit without knowing what it
did  that  gave  rise  to  the  claims. 8  More  controversially,  Rules  8  and
12(b)(6) give district courts means to dismiss suits that are not justifiable in
light of the governing substantive legal scheme.59

A.  The Relevant FederalR  ules
The Federal Rules are to be interpreted like federal  statutes, according
to  plain  language  principles  of  interpretation.  The  Supreme  Court
unanimously  held in Leatherman that Rule 8 "meant what it said.",60  The
rules, then, are not subject to amendment by judicial interpretation.61  The
plain  language  of Rule  8  and  Rule  12  provide  substantial  ammunition
supporting the  Court's decision  in Twombly  strictly to curtail the  Conley
rule.
The preeminent  treatise on federal  procedure  notes that the broadest
interpretation of the Conley dictum (the "sky is blue" allegations) cannot be
the  rule.62  Professor  Miller notes that  "a  bare averment  that the pleader
wants  compensation  and  is  entitled  to  it"  is  insufficient.63   That
understanding of Rule 8 respects the requirement  contained in the rule that
a  plaintiff make  "a  short  and plain  statement  of the  claim  showing  the
pleader is entitled to relief."6"  Despite Conley, the Supreme Court held in
2005-its most recent prior analysis of the Rule 8 standard-that a plaintiff
must allege facts making out each element of its claim.
In Dura Pharmaceuticals,I nc. v. Broudo,65 the Court considered the
standards for pleading a private plaintiff claim for a violation of the federal
securities  laws.  The substantive  claim at issue in Dura was a violation of
section  10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and SEC Rule lOb-5.
The  claim  required  proof  of  six  elements,  one  of  which  is  "loss
causation.  66  Loss  causation  is  the  existence  of a proximate  causal  link
(discussing  three  rules  governing  pleading  under Rule  8 including  notice,  ensuring  the
viability  of the  claim,  and  the  requirement  that  the  claim  be  premised  on  a  "factual
transaction and not simply on an abstract invocation of the law").  Of course, the rules are
not written on a blank slate.  The Federal Rules operate against a constitutional backdrop.  It
is possible the Constitution has more stringent standards than does the text of Rules 8 and 12
for permitting plaintiffs to have access to federal court.  See Thomas, supra note 16, at 6-7
(arguing "the Supreme Court was wrong to state that Congress and the rule-makers could
impose essentially limitless requirements upon plaintiffs at the pleading stage").

between  a material  misrepresentation  and the plaintiffs  loss.67  Although
the  Private  Securities  Litigation  Reform  Act governs  claims  under  Rule
1Ob-5  and imposes  a heightened pleading  standard on those claims, 68 the
Court  "assume[d],  at least  for argument's sake,  that neither  the Rules nor
the securities statutes  impose any special further requirement  in respect to
the pleading  of proximate causation or economic  lOSS.,'69  In Dura, Rule  8
and  Conley governed  the pleading  issue.  The Court  held that the notice
requirement  from Conley was not satisfied  because the complaint did not
contain  allegations  going to  an essential  element-one  that  the  plaintiff
would be required to prove at trial--of the plaintiffs claim.7°
It  is  interesting  that,  after  the  Court's  unanimous  statements  in
Leatherman and  Swierkiewicz that  Rule  8 is  subject  to  plain-language
interpretation, the Dura Court relied for its holding on a judicial gloss from
Conley.7  In Dura, Rule 8's textual requirement that the plaintiff "show[]
entitle[ment] to relief' would have been a sufficient basis for the holding.
By  contrast,  Dura is  harder  to justify  based  on a  lack  of notice.  The
"notice" goals Conley grafted onto Rule 8 were met in Dura7.2
The Second Circuit in  Twombly gave Dura only passing mention.  It
preferred the Court's 2002 decision in Swierkiewicz v. Sorema N.A.73 which
held that a plaintiff need not plead around a burden-shifting framework for
a Title  VII claim.  The Title  VII complaint at issue in  Swierkiewicz was
sufficient even  if the plaintiff did  not plead a lack of non-discriminatory
reasons for its disparate treatment.74
In one  sense,  the  Title  VII  claim  in Swierkiewicz makes  a  facially
attractive  analogy  to the  Sherman  One suit.  In a  suit under Title  VII, a
plaintiff can  claim  he  or  she  was  treated  differently  than  was  another
employee,  who is not a member of a protected  class.  The employer then
has the burden to demonstrate a legitimate,  non-discriminatory reason for
the disparate treatment.  Only if the employer  does  so  must the plaintiff

lob-5 defendant.  That element has nothing to do with the conduct of the defendant and
everything  to do with the circumstances  of the plaintiff.  Cf Ides, supra note 59, at 612

bring  evidence  to  demonstrate  that  justification  is  pretextual.75  The
conspiracy claim under Sherman One is analogous.  A plaintiff must prove
sufficient facts giving rise to an inference of conspiracy, and the defendants
can rebut those facts with a non-conspiratorial justification for the conduct
alleged.  If the defendants do so, presumably-like the Title VII plaintiff-
the Sherman One plaintiff would argue the justification is pretextual.
Viewed  more  pragmatically,  the  Sherman  One  conspiracy  claim  is
dramatically  different  from  Swierkiewicz7. 6   The  Title  VII-type  burden
shifting  analysis  has  no  place  in  the  context  of  Sherman  One.  The
plaintiff's affirmative case includes the requirement that the plaintiff plead
and prove that the conduct alleged was the product of a conspiracy.  That
requirement  exists  whether  or  not  the  defendant  provides  an  alternate
explanation.  The distinction is made clearer by noting Justice  Thomas's
admonition  in Swierkiewicz that "the McDonnell Douglas framework does
not apply  in every  employment discrimination  case."77  That is much in
contrast  to  the  Sherman  One standard.  The requirement  that a  plaintiff
plead and prove that conduct was the result of a conspiracy is immutable.
The  reason  Swierkiewicz  does  little  to  inform  the  Sherman  One
standard is perhaps best understood as a policy distinction underlying the
respective  substantive  legal rules  of Title VII  and Sherman  One.  As  in
Conley,  itself  an  employment-rights  case,  McDonnell  Douglas  and
Swierkiewicz reflect a policy decision favoring workers in protected classes
by presuming discrimination from a showing of disparate treatment.  The
antitrust rules  do  not presume  a  conspiracy  from  allegations  of parallel
conduct.  They presume  legitimate business justifications exist  for firms'
conduct.7"
It  is easy to be  misled by the  language  the  Supreme  Court used in
Conley to  gloss the  Rule  8  standard.  Under the  "sky  is blue"  pleading
theory, so long as a plaintiff s complaint did not affirmatively demonstrate
the lack of entitlement  to relief, the motion  to dismiss would be denied.
Another dean of federal civil procedure, Professor Hazard, stated that view

76.  But see Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 127 S. Ct. 1955,  1982 (2007) (Stevens, J.,

in tension with Swierkiewicz do not address this distinction.  See Dodson, supra note 22, at
127-28.  This distinction prevents reconciling the apparent tension between  Twombly and
the Sherman One claim on the one hand, and Swierkiewicz and the Title VII claim on the
other, by either reinterpreting Sherman One to involve burden shifting or reinterpreting Title
VII to include the lack of a non-discriminatory reason for the employment decision as an
element of the plaintiff's affirmative case.  The first would improperly increase the risk of
false positives (see infra Part III) while the second would undermine the Title VII claim.2008] PRIVATE ANTITRUST CONSPIRACY CLAIMS
this way:  "Literal  compliance with Conley v.  Gibson could consist simply
of giving  the  names  of the  plaintiff and  the  defendant,  and  asking  for
judgment."79
Surely Conley did not announce such a non-standard.  If it did, it was
dictum, as the complaint in Conley easily satisfies even the more stringent
standard  the Court recognized in Dura and Twombly.8°  More importantly
for the  purposes  of this  Article,  Dura and  Twombly  clearly  require  the
pleading of elements of a claim.  The elements are the "showing"  that the
plaintiff is "entitled to relief."'"
Looking  beyond  the plain  text  of Rule  8 (and  beyond  the  glosses
imposed by courts following Conley), commentary by Judge Charles Clark,
the  "architect"  of the  federal  rules,  and  his  contemporaries  supports
interpreting Rule  8 to require plaintiffs  to plead elements.  The thrust  of
Rule 8, to Judge Clark, was the avoidance of detail  in pleadings-not the
elimination of a requirement that the plaintiff "state a claim."82  According
to New Jersey Supreme  Court Justice Arthur T. Vanderbilt, analyzing  the
Federal Civil Rules,
the objective of reaching an issue of law or of fact in two or at the
most  three  simple  pleadings  has  been  attained  but  not  at the
sacrifice of stating the elements of a claim or defense  ....  The
grand  objective  of the  movement  for  simplified  procedure  by
rules of court is the elimination of the interminable prolixity and
absurd  technicalities  of special  pleading-not  by  abandoning
stating the essentials of a cause of action or of a defense, but by
doing so in 'simple, concise and direct'  terms.83
Others noted the importance  of following the text of Rules 8 and 12.
"A claim for which relief can be granted is a claim which is cognizable  in
law.,84  Another commentator decried interpretations  of Rule 8(a)(2)  that

Any  realistic appreciation  of Conley must acknowledge  Justice  Black's frustration with
shenanigans by unions in avoiding their Railway Labor Act obligations to represent black
members  fairly.  The opinion  begins, "Once  again [black] employees  are here  under the
Railway Labor Act asking that their collective bargaining agent be compelled to represent
them  fairly.  In a  series of cases  . . . this  Court has repeatedly  ruled that an exclusive
bargaining agent under the Railway Labor Act is obligated to represent all employees in the
bargaining unit fairly and without discrimination on the basis of race ....  Id. at 42.
81.  Rule 12(b)(6) provides further support for the plain-language interpretation of Rule
8(a).  If the broadest understanding of the Conley gloss were law, it would write out of the

B.  Application to "The Big Case"
Even advocates  of liberal pleading  practice  emphasize  the necessity
that  a  complaint  put  the  defendant  on  notice  of the  claims  against  it.
Indeed,  "notice"  is the  preferred justification  for the  pleading  standard.
Professor Fairman favors a less stringent pleading standard, but nonetheless
recognizes that the notice requirement is what precludes a plaintiff's resort
to  alleging  legal  conclusions,  rather  than  facts  supporting  the  claims.
"Legal  conclusions do not comport  with  a  notice standard."87  Professor
Ides  advances  another justification  for the  prohibition  of pleading  legal
conclusions.  He argues that "the complaint must place the claims asserted
within the  context  of a  factual  narrative.""s  Ides derives  his  view  from
some combination of Rule 8's requirement of a "showing" of entitlement to
relief and the Article III "case  or controversy"  requirement  for a claim in
federal court.89
If one looks only to "Form 9," the model form in the Federal Rules for
a  complaint  alleging  negligence,90  it  might  appear  that  conclusory
allegations are always permitted. 9' Form 9 establishes as a matter of law
that a complaint  alleging the defendant  "negligently  drove"  is  sufficient.
Alleging "negligence"  is certainly alleging a legal conclusion.92  Form 9 is
not terribly informative as to the problem of pleading "the big case" such as
a  Sherman  One  conspiracy.  "Negligently  drove"  describes  a  narrow,
generally agreed-upon set of circumstances.  The allegation provides notice
to the party who is alleged to have negligently driven what generally, if not

what exactly, he or she is supposed to have done wrong.93  "Conspiracy,"  as
is demonstrated in some depth within, at least under the antitrust laws, is a
slippery concept.94
Judge  Clark would have  agreed that some  line exists beyond  which
allegations  are too conclusory  to be sufficient.  He considered  it "settled"
that  "the  pleader  shows  the  facts  and  the  court  applies  the  legal
conclusion."95
The notice requirement distinguished Twombly from Swierkiewicz and
Conley.  In both  of those cases, the  defendants  knew  exactly  what they
supposedly  had done wrong.  The complaints  alleged plaintiffs  had been
treated  differently  based  on  national  origin  and  race,  respectively.  An
additional  allegation  that  there  was  no  race  or  national-origin  neutral
justification for the defendant's conduct would not improve the defendants'
understanding of what they did to aggrieve the plaintiffs.
The  Sherman  One  claim  is  different.  Allegations  that a  defendant
"conspired"  does  not tell the defendant  what conduct,  from the  limitless
possible  things  corporations  (acting  through their  agents)  do, constituted
the conspiracy.  That is especially so in view of the imperfect  and much-
debated definition of a Sherman One conspiracy.96  Answering a complaint
and preparing a defense would require an internal investigation that would
mirror  the  discovery  process  in  litigation.97   Even  that  would  not
necessarily inform the defendant what conduct the plaintiff would seize on
to  support its claim.  If notice concerns  could justify the  result in Dura,
where  the unpleaded element  was a causal connection  between the  fraud
and harm to the plaintiff-a subsidiary element in the  1O b-5  claim-they
are all the more pressing where the unpleaded element is the crux of what
the plaintiff is supposed to have done wrong.
The notice  concerns  take  on  special  significance  in the  context  of
massive  commercial  tort  cases.  The  onerous  nature  of discovery  gives
plaintiffs "an in terrorem increment of the settlement value."98  Blue Chip
Stamps v.  Manor Drug Stores and Dura are  securities  fraud  cases,  but
93.  See Ides, supra note 59, at 611-12 (range of conduct giving rise to "negligence" is
sufficiently small).  But see Spencer, supra note 54, at 38 (arguing "reckless" in Form  10 is
indefinite).
94.  See Ides, supra note 59, at 610 (although what constitutes "notice"  does not vary
with  different  kinds of claims,  what kind  of pleading  is required to  give  that notice  is
variable;  Form 9 does not inform the manner of pleading more complex claims); see also
infra Part II1. It is not outstanding to note that the distinction between conclusory "factual"
allegations,  which the forms  approve, and  conclusory  legal  allegations,  which  Twombly
reiterates are insufficient, is an arbitrary one.  Gray areas will exist.  However, "conspiracy"
and "agreement" under the antitrust laws is not within the gray areas.

twice  the  Supreme Court  has  expressed the  same concern  for settlement
leverage in the context of private antitrust litigation.  In Associated General
Contractorso  f California,I nc. v. California State Council of Carpenters9,9
the Court noted that a district court retains discretion "to insist upon some
specificity  in  pleading  before  allowing  a  potentially  massive  factual
controversy  to  proceed."'00   The  same  is  true in  Twombly.  Courts and
commentators note "the costs of modem federal antitrust litigation"'0' and
the  concerns,  which  private  antitrust  litigation  presents  in  spades,  of
"asymmetric discovery costs.''102
One  response  is  that  district  courts  can  use  their powers  over  the
discovery process to rein in those costs  and abuses.  The  Twombly  Court
believed that response is too facile.03  Judge  Easterbrook has argued that
for a host of reasons, control of discovery by district judges is a marginally
effective protection against abuses.  If discovery is used to find the details
of the  claim  because the  complaint  is  sketchy,  limiting  areas  of inquiry
based on the contours  of the cause of action is impossible.  It is also not
effective to confine areas of inquiry based on the likelihood of it producing
fruit;  judges  have  no  way  to  know  what  the  files  of the  recipient  of
discovery  contain.  Only  truly  ridiculous  requests  will  be  possible  to
contain."  Another problem with relying  on district judges  to use  their
inherent powers to rein in discovery costs is "the increasing caseload of the
federal courts."'05  Even if judges were equipped to do it, close monitoring
of years of pre-trial activities would bring the system to a halt.06
A more robust response  is that the very circumstances giving rise to
asymmetric  discovery  costs  inure  to  defendants'  benefit  as  well.
Asymmetric  discovery costs will exist in circumstances where information

asymmetries  are present as  well.'17  If it  is  more  expensive  to defend  a
private antitrust suit than it is to prosecute one, it is commensurately  more
difficult for a private antitrust plaintiff to learn what happened in  order to
draft  its  complaint,  or  to  structure  a  document  request  or  a  deposition
notice.  This  information  asymmetry  favoring  defendants  encourages  a
liberal pleading standard.
Three  reasons-two  primarily  theoretical,  one  doctrinal-show
otherwise.  Noted  commentators  including  Judge  Bork  and  Professor
Epstein have shown that error in antitrust litigation should be on the side of
false negatives  rather than  false positives,  because the  market  is able  to
correct  for  a  failure  to  regulate  but  not  for  the  loss  caused  by  over-
regulation.0 8 That concern is greater in the context of private litigation than
in the  context  of government  enforcement  because  of the  concerns  for
misaligned  incentives.  Also, Sherman  One  claims,  more  so than  claims
under other legal schemes that are better understood (like the auto accident
in  Form  9),  raise  the  concern  that  plaintiffs  are  not  able  to  exercise
judgment  about  the  likelihood  that  observed  actions  result  from  illegal
conduct.'09  They are therefore  more likely to sue over innocent  conduct,
exacerbating  the  false  positive  concern.  Finally,  the  doctrine  supports
stringent  review  of  pleadings  in  large  civil  litigation  to  better  align
settlements and liability with actual bad conduct."0
Twombly, involving  a purported class of all users  of local telephone
and  Internet  services  against  all  of the  Baby Bells, may  have boasted  a
nuisance  settlement  value exceeding  $10  million.  Given  the potentially
crippling  liability  the  defendants  faced,  plaintiffs  would  have  massive
leverage in negotiations.  The concern that underlies Blue Chip Stamps and

109.  Empirical  evidence  supports  the  proposition  that  lay jurors  are  more  likely  to
believe conduct  is the result of an  antitrust  conspiracy  than  is consistent with  a robust
understanding of business conduct.  See Barbara S. Swain, Presentation at the ABA Section
of Antitrust Law, 55th Annual Spring Meeting:  We All Had the Same Idea:  How a Jury
Considers Claims Under the Monsanto Standard (Apr. 18,  2007) (paper and slides on file
with author).  Analysis should be done of the relevance of that research to understanding
decision-making by plaintiffs and the impact of that evidence on pleading private antitrust
claims.
110.  See, e.g.,  Associated Gen. Contractors v. California  State Council of Carpenters,
459 U.S. 519, 528 n.17 (1983).  Built into the doctrinal view is the understanding that a
plaintiff that does not know of illegal conduct has no right to conduct a fishing expedition in
an attempt to find it. See DM Research, Inc. v. College of Am. Pathologists,  170 F.3d 53,
56 (1st Cir.  1999).  Cf Brian  Fitzsimmons, Note,  The Injustice of Notice & Heightened

Associated General Contractorsi s that settlements are made with no regard
to defendants'  actual liability.  That danger was presented in Twombly."'
"The  Big Case,"  a  term coined  by Judge Clark  requires  a  "critical
assessment of the costs and benefits of stopping litigation at the pleading
stage relative to those of going forward with discovery."'12  That was what
the  Supreme  Court  meant  in Associated General Contractors, when  it
recommended that district courts "insist upon some specificity in pleading"
in large private antitrust cases.' 13
According  to  Federal  Rule  of Civil Procedure  8(e),  "[a]ll  pleadings
shall be so construed as to do substantial justice."  That injunction is an odd
one.  District courts are required (they do not have discretion) to use their
discretion.  The Rule  8(e)  injunction  is  also result  oriented,  not process
oriented.  It  insists that substantial justice be accomplished  and does  not
limit a court's choices as to how to achieve it1.14
Former  Rule  8(f)  tends  to be  applied  to  resuscitate  a complaint  to
protect a plaintiffs cause of action.'  In Swierkiewicz, the  Court quoted
Rule  8(f)  in passing  while  emphasizing  the  simplicity  of the  Rule  8(a)
notice pleading standard.  In Conley, the Court used Rule 8(f) for the same
purpose.16  Neither Court discussed the rule  in greater detail  or found it
necessary  to  invoke  it  to  hold  the  complaints  met  the  notice  standard.
Certainly,  there  is  nothing  about  former  Rule  8(f)  that  prevents  its
application as recommended here.  Judge Keeton did so in Cash Energy v.
111.  "The same rules of discovery that generate one or two days worth of litigation in
simple contract disputes" can take "years if not decades"  in the case of massive class action
litigation against national companies like the Twombly defendants.  Epstein, supra note 11,

suits in the merger context).  Indeed, the Supreme Court was convinced.
That  potential  expense  is  obvious  enough  in  the  present  case:  plaintiffs
represent  a putative  class  of at  least  90 percent  of all  subscribers  to  local
telephone or high-speed Internet service in the continental United States, in an
action  against  America's  largest  telecommunications  firms  (with  many
thousands of employees generating reams and gigabytes of business records) for
unspecified (if any) instances of antitrust violations that allegedly occurred over
a period of seven years.

"'substantial  justice,'  may  be  read  as  requiring  judges to  exercise  some
degree  of discretion  rather  than  invariably  applying  the  general  rule  of
notice pleading.""'8  The Twombly Court's rejection of the Conley gloss in
the  context  of the  massive  litigation  at  issue  is  reminiscent  of Judge
Keeton's wisdom in applying Rule 8(f),  although the Supreme Court failed
to invoke the rule."19
III.  THE SUBSTANTIVE LAW OF SHERMAN ONE
Twombly  does  not  state  a  new  way  to  understand  pleading
procedure.2°  It  is  an application  of the plain language  of Rule  8 to the
complex  substantive  law  of antitrust conspiracies.  At a  minimum,  that
means  that  the  Twombly  rule  is  trans-substantive.  The  prolixity  of a
complaint  will  depend on the  complexity  of the  substantive  rule  of law
being applied.'2
A.  ParallelC  onduct is Not Enough
The  Sherman  One  claim  requires a  showing  of a  conspiracy.  That
element  has  never  been  satisfied  with  a  mere  showing  of competitors'
parallel conduct.'22
The rationale for requiring more than a showing of parallel conduct by
competitors to  state a Sherman One claim is simple.  No matter what the
level of competitiveness  in an industry, economists know that firms acting
rationally  can  be  expected  to  behave  in  a  parallel  manner.  Amici
117.  768 F. Supp. 892 (D. Mass. 1991).
118.  Id. at 897.  The approach is taken without citing authority other than the former
Rule 8(f), and has not been followed by any court.
119.  Commentators, too, have done surprisingly little to clarify Rule 8(e) (formerly 8(f)).
Like  the  majority  of courts  invoking  its  language,  commentators  favoring  simplified
pleading standards cite the former Rule 8(f) in support.  See, e.g., Fairman, supra note 55, at
993.  None have invoked it in support of Judge Keeton's interpretation in Cash Energy.
120.  But see, e.g., Kendall v. Visa U.S.A.,  Inc.,  No. 05-16549,  Slip Op. 2191  n.5 (9th
Cir. Mar. 7, 2008).
121.  Cf Ides, supra note 59, at 610.
122.  Arguing against the Twombly result, Professor Thomas contends that "evidence that
the ILECs engaged in the same behavior against the CLECs, and also the same behavior of
not competing with one another could demonstrate to a jury that the ILECs agreed to engage
in this behavior  ....  [T]his parallel behavior could show agreement."  Thomas, supra, note
16 (draft at 32).  That is incorrect.  Parallel conduct is not inconsistent with a conspiracy, but
it is not indicative  of-it in no circumstances "demonstrates"-a conspiracy.  To permit a
jury to infer an agreement from parallel behavior is indistinguishable from permitting the
same jury to infer agreement from the fact that the sky is blue, which it seems clear no court
has ever done.  See supra notes 16, 79.646  U. PA. JOURNAL OF BUSINESS AND EMPLOYMENT LAW  [Vol. 10:3
economists  in Twombly argued that in a "perfectly competitive market, all
firms  charge  the  same  price  at  all  times."' 23   That  is  because  in  a
competitive market, all firms are price takers.  They all respond in the same
manner to the same impulses, and none has the ability to raise prices above
its costs. 124
The  same  result  occurs  if  the  firms  do have  power  over  price  as
oligopolists  in  a  concentrated  industry-much  more  akin  to  the  real
circumstances in Twombly.'25  Parallel conduct occurs perhaps for the same
reason  as  in  a  competitive  market,  for  example  when  regulatory
developments or technological  innovations affect all  firms in the industry
in  the  same  manner. 126  Parallel  conduct  also  potentially  occurs  for  a
different, but also innocent, reason.  Firms, like gas-station competitors on
opposite  street  comers,  may  look  two  moves  ahead  and  appreciate  the
effect their actions will have on their competitor, and vice  versa.  Those
oligopolists know, and they know their competitors know, and they know
their competitors know they know,'27 that if they act as industry mavericks
they  will  be  less  profitable  than  if  they  tacitly  agree  not to  cut,  or to
increase, prices.128  That kind of coordination-although  a contracts scholar
might well call it an implied agreement-is not illegal.129
There  are  two  primary  justifications  for  permitting  such  tacit
collusion.  One, advanced by Professor Turner in his  1962 paper  on the
subject, holds that an oligopolist acting in its unilateral best interest is the
same thing  as tacit collusion,  so to  outlaw the latter would be to require

PRIVATE ANTITRUST CONSPIRACY CLAIMS
irrational  conduct.30   Professor  Whinston  recently  demonstrated  the
difficulty  that  Turner  recognized:  "Can  we  tell  [oligopolists]  'Do  not
tacitly  collude'?  Or 'Do  not make your pricing  decisions with regard to
what your rivals do'?"''  The concern is heightened when we consider the
punitive nature of the Sherman One enforcement  scheme.  "[W]ould  it be
fair  to  send  managers  to  jail  for  failing  to  follow  such  vague
prescriptions?"' 32  The private treble-damages remedy is no better, because
of its punitive nature.
A  second  rationale  for permitting  tacit  collusion,  which  is  closely
related  to  the  first,  turns  on  the  difficulty  of  distinguishing  between
independent  parallel  activity and  interdependent  conduct.  To an outside
observer,  the  two  are  indistinguishable.  For  one  example,  imitating
successful  strategies  of  competitors  is  acting  in  parallel,  but  it  is
competitive,  not  anti-competitive.'33   Far  from  being  probably  anti-
competitive,  parallel  conduct  by competitors  is most  likely the result  of
unilateral-and therefore legitimate-business decisions.'34
This wisdom underlay the Supreme Court's 1954 decision in Theatre
Enterprises,I nc. v. Paramount Film DistributingC  orp.,'35 a case in many
ways very similar to Twombly.  In an opinion written by Justice Tom Clark,
formerly  the  head  of the  Antitrust  Division  at  the  U.S.  Department  of
Justice,36 the  Court considered  allegations that parallel  refusal to permit
"first-run"  movies to be shown  outside of densely populated metropolitan
areas  violated  Sherman  One.  The  defendants  were  a group  of motion
picture producers and distributors, including Paramount  Film Distributing,
Loew's,  Inc.,  Twentieth-Century  Fox,  United  Artists,  Warner  Brothers
Pictures, and Columbia Pictures.1"'  Plaintiff was an operator of a suburban
Baltimore theater, called the Crest, that was modem and well-appointed in
every way but its location.'38  All of the defendants  rebuffed the plaintiffs
efforts to  obtain first-run movies,  arguing  that exclusive  franchises  were

necessary  for  their  business,  and  plaintiffs  inferior  location  made  an
exclusive  franchise  with  that  theater  unattractive. 39   Many  of  the
defendants  shared  the  same  rational,  non-conspiratorial  explanation  for
their individual refusals to deal with the plaintiff in the market for first-run
pictures. 14   According  to  the  Court,  "The  crucial  question  is  whether
respondents'  conduct  toward  petitioner  stemmed  from  independent
decision or from an agreement, tacit or express ....  [T]his Court has never
held  that  proof  of parallel  business  behavior  conclusively  establishes
agreement  or,  phrased differently,  that such  behavior  itself constitutes  a
141
Sherman Act offense.'
Procedurally,  Theatre Enterprises is  poor  authority  for the  rule  in
Twombly at the motion-to-dismiss stage.  The Court in Theatre Enterprises
reached  the  un-outstanding  conclusion  that  a  refusal  to  grant  a  directed
verdict for the plaintiff should be affirmed.142  But the Court's substantive
rule  on the  definition  of a  Sherman One  agreement  provides  substantial
support  for  the  result  in  Twombly.  Conscious  parallel  conduct  by
competitors does not suffice to  state a claim under Sherman One.  Noted
antitrust  commentators  such as  Professor Turner have  accepted the  rule.
"[C]onscious parallelism is never meaningful by itself ....  [It is] a neutral
fact in the absence of evidence which would lead one to expect that price
would  have  been  different  if  truly  independent  decisions  had  been
made."'43
Turner's  proposition  is  by  no  means  unchallenged  among
commentators  in the modern era.  The other side of the argument-most
prominently  advanced  by  Judge  Posner-holds  that  consciously  parallel
conduct, where competing gas stations on opposite street comers raise and
lower  prices,  seemingly  in  unison,  sometimes  several  times a  day,  does
actually reflect a meeting of the minds of those competitors, and should be
treated  as  conspiratorial.'44   Posner  recognizes  his  approach  is  not  the
"traditional  legal  approach,"  and  instead  defines  collusive  pricing as  an

occurred during the trial, as not being made in good faith.  Respondents Loew's and Warner
refused petitioner  an exclusive  license because they owned  the three  downtown theatres

economic construct. 45  As Posner states, "From  an economic standpoint  it
is  a  detail  whether  the  collusive  pricing  scheme  was  organized  and
implemented  in  such  a  way  as  to  generate  evidence  of  actual
communications."' 46  Professor Whinston points out, however, that there is
1
neither clear understanding of what exactly constitutes tacit collusion.  For
example,  is  it tacitly collusive  anytime prices in an oligopolistic industry
exceed  marginal  cost?147   Recent  game  theoretic  economic  analysis,
detailed by economists including Werden and Carlton, has offered a more
nuanced  understanding  of consciously  parallel  pricing  than  the  Turner-
Posner  divide  demonstrates. 48   However,  from  a  doctrinal  perspective,
what is essential is that the Theatre Enterprisesr ule has been solidly etched
into the body of Sherman  One doctrine. 49  Barring federal legislation, the
doctrinal approach to conscious parallelism should remain unmolested.50
It is a dangerous  game to indulge the inference of a conspiracy based
on facts, like parallel conduct, that more likely indicate legitimate unilateral
conduct.  As Professor Epstein has argued, such an inference presents two
harms.  One is the direct costs on the business of the particular defendants,
and  the  dead  weight  economic  costs  of  litigation.  The  other  is  the
disincentives the inference  would create for firms vigorously to compete,
because  all  "business  decisions  would  be  colored"  by  the  danger  of
Sherman  One  litigation.'5'  Those  are  precisely  the  concerns  underlying
Dura, Blue Chip Stamps and Associated General Contractors.
Firms  faced  with  sanctions  for  acting  in  parallel  would  be  acting
rationally  if  they  deliberately  avoided  the  most  efficient  course  of
conduct-whether  that  be  imitating  competitors'  winning  strategies,  or
pricing in parallel so as not to give a competitor an advantage.  Judge Bork

exposing  them  to  litigation  beyond  the  motion  to  dismiss  stage)  for
undertaking  the  rational  response  to  stimuli,  whether  the  actions  of
competitors  or external  to the market,  risks  increasing  price rigidity  and
stifling other business decisions.  That is all the more so where, as in the
case  of the definition  of agreement  under  Sherman  One,  the substantive
standards for liability remain vague.  Whinston notes that under the Posner
definition of agreement,  "[f]alse  positives are a real danger" because  it is
difficult even to define what qualifies, and to structure an effective remedy
for tacitly collusive conduct.'54
Those theoretical arguments  are powerful.  The expense of litigation
creates  a powerful  disincentive  to  engage  in conduct  that might  bring it
about.'55  Where that conduct is harmful, that is a good result.  Where that
conduct is beneficial, it is a grievous error.'56
The theoretical  explanation  for  the  Twombly  rule runs  up against a
criticism, however, which is that the danger of litigation apparently did not
prevent the  Twombly defendants  from acting rationally  in pursuit of their
unilateral  best interest in response to market stimuli.  Where,  then, is the
chilling effect?  One response  to the criticism is that we have no way of
knowing how many industries have been limited in their competitive vigor
by  the  threat  of  litigation,  or  indeed,  in  what  circumstances  the  very
defendants  in Twombly may have avoided pro-competitive conduct out of
fear of litigation.
Another response to the criticism is merely one of fairness.  Onerous
litigation  is a sanction in a very real sense, and sanctioning firms for what
we want them to do makes no sense.

156.  It is usually in the context of section 2 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. § 2 (2000 &
Supp.  V 2005), that courts  and  commentators  discuss  the  concern for "false  positives"
preventing vigorous competition.  See, e.g., Matsushita  Electric Industrial  Co. v. Zenith
Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 593-94 (1986).  These arguments thus have all the more force in
the context of Sherman Two litigation.2008] PRIVATE ANTITRUST CONSPIRACY CLAIMS
Finally, Professor Fairman argued  in 2003 that  courts have  required
fact-based pleading in conspiracy claims long before Twombly. "'  If so, it
is  the  Second  Circuit's  rule  that  is  the  aberration,  and  the  Twombly
defendants would have made their business decisions based on expectations
developed under the dominant approach courts took to pleading.'58
The  challenge  is  to  distinguish  those  claims  that  are  inappropriate
sanctions  for  pro-competitive  conduct-the  false  positives-from  those
that  appropriately  act  as  disincentives  to  harmful  conduct.  Courts  and
commentators  understand that the height of competitive activity may look
very much like conduct that violates Sherman One.59  The surest way is  to
enforce rigorously the Dura requirement that a plaintiff plead the elements
of the substantive claim.  In a nutshell, that is what Twombly now requires
for private suits alleging antitrust conspiracies.
B.  Pleading Plus Factors
In 1984 in Monsanto Co. v. Spray-Rite Services Corp.,16° the Supreme
Court  refused  to  infer  an  agreement  from  conduct  that  occurs  "in  the
normal  course  of  business  and  do[es]  not  indicate  illegal  concerted
action.' 6'   This is an application of the same rule that prohibits liability for
parallel conduct.  Instead, and for the various reasons discussed previously
in this Article, "there must be evidence that tends to exclude the possibility
that the [defendants]  were acting independently.' 62  The Court reiterated
that requirement two years later, in the opinion that served as a capstone to
the decades-old  litigation  in Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. v. Zenith
Radio Corp.1 63  "[A]  plaintiff seeking damages for a violation of § 1 must
present  evidence  'that  tends  to  exclude  the  possibility'  that  the  alleged
conspirators acted independently."' 64 That is a faithful rendering of Justice
Clark's Theatre Enterprisesr ule.

insufficient as a matter of law.  See Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp,
475 U.S. at 576 (showing that the Matsushita lesson gives strong contextual support for the
result in Twombly).652  U. PA. JOURNAL OF BUSINESS AND EMPLOYMENT LAW [Vol.  10:3
Those  rules  are  substantive  rules  of  the  law  of conspiracies  in
antitrust, not procedural  requirements imposed because  of some particular
feature  of the antitrust claim.  Such an account  implies that the Twombly
opinion is not a civil procedure  opinion at all, but is important only from
the perspective of the substantive antitrust law.  That explains how Theatre
Enterprises could have compelled the result in Twombly, although the issue
arose at a very different stage of the litigation.
Procedurally, Dura commanded the conclusion-and Swierkiewicz did
not  undermine  it-that  the  Twombly  plaintiffs  were  required  to  plead
allegations that satisfy the Matsushita and Theatre Enterprises rules.  The
question is, then, what about the state of the market for local telephone and
Internet services makes parallel conduct in that market any more nefarious
than in the vast majority of circumstances?
Allegations  of facts that are neutral,  or ambiguous,  do not meet the
standard.  Commentators  analyzing  Matsushita agree  that  "proof  of an
agreement  requires  some  evidence  that  is  exclusively  of agreement."'165
Courts  and  commentators  have  stated  the  required  showing  for
circumstantial  evidence  of  conspiracy  to  be  one  of "parallel  conduct
plus"-with the "plus"  representing  allegations  that  make  it unlikely  the
parallel conduct is based on a firm's pursuit of its unilateral best interest.166
Professor Epstein explained plus factors using the language  of Monsanto.
"A plus factor is any form of evidence that tends to exclude the possibility
that  individuals  work independently."'167   Whinston  describes  "evidence"
that "increas[es]  the likelihood that a price-fixing conspiracy  is taking, or
has taken, place."'161  Such plus-factor evidence is necessary when there is
no direct evidence of a conspiracy, but where enforcement policy demands
there be a way to prove a conspiracy with indirect evidence. 69

PRIVATE ANTITRUST CONSPIRACY CLAIMS
Notably, although  the doctrine  was argued to  the Court in  Twombly
and has been discussed in the lower courts for decades, the Supreme Court
did not expressly adopt the doctrine of plus factors. 70
The  idea  of plus  factors  has  long  been  understood  by  the  Court.
Theatre  Enterprises recognized  that  "business  behavior  is  admissible
circumstantial  evidence from which the fact finder may infer agreement."''
In  Twombly,  the  Court  came  close  to  explicitly  adopting  the  construct,
twice quoting other sources (the Second Circuit's decision below and one
of the parties'  briefs) as referencing "plus factors,"  and in the now-famous
footnote  four  defining  additional  circumstantial  facts  that  might  be
sufficient  to  vault  allegations  of parallel  conduct  into  allegations  of a
conspiracy."'  It  is  fair to  read the  Twombly opinion  as  giving  implicit
approval  to  an  approach  to  implementing  the  Theatre  Enterprises,
Matsushita and Monsanto rules that has been followed in the lower courts
for  decades.  With  the  deepening  body  of  case  law  and  scholarly
commentary  defining plus factors, an appropriate  vehicle  for the Court to
consider them in greater depth may present itself in the near future.
It is good that the Court did not simply adopt wholesale the plus factor
doctrine  from  the  courts  of  appeals.  Much  remains  to  be  decided  to
consider that framework sufficiently developed.  Professor Whinston wrote
about the definition of a Sherman One agreement generally, arguing that it
is "paradoxical  that the least controversial area of antitrust is perhaps  the
one  in which  the  basis of the  policy  in  economic  theory is  weakest."'73
That theoretical weakness invokes Judge Bork's concern for "fair warning"
to a regulated entity-impossible "if the 'law'  depends on the sympathies
and prejudices of any one of the hundreds of federal judges before whom [a
businessman]  may find himself arraigned."''74  Although Whinston did not
adopt  the  terminology  of  plus  factors,  he  described  them  as  being
represented by either structural evidence or behavioral evidence.'75
Evidence  that tends to exclude the possibility of unilateral conduct is
not difficult  to  recognize  at the  margins.  One  example  is the  one  plus
factor  that  the  Twombly  Court  appeared  to  approve  in  footnote  four:
170.  Bell Atlantic Corp.  v. Twombly,  127 S. Ct.  1955,  1964  (2007).  See Interstate
Circuit  v.  United  States,  306  U.S.  208  (1939);  E.  THOMAS  SULLIVAN  &  JEFFREY  L.

"complex and historically unprecedented changes in pricing structure made
at the  very  same  time  by  multiple  competitors,  and  made  for no other
discernible  reason."' 76  Of course,  the challenge in the footnote  four plus
factor  is in  the  words,  "for no  other  discernible  reason."  The difficult
question in  Twombly  is precisely  whether "other  discernible reasons"  for
the  ILECs  parallel  refusal  to  enter  into  competition  as  CLECs  in  one
another's  territories  undid the plaintiffs'  allegations  that the  refusal  was
irrational.
Plus factors have included a vague amalgam of matters, all of which
are relevant (in the way the Federal Rules of Evidence define the term) to
proof of conspiracy, but many of which fall far short of rising to the level
of "tending  to exclude the possibility" of unilateral  conduct.  Some of the
facts  pleaded  in  Twombly,  including  trade  association  involvement  and
oligopolistic market structure, have been considered plus factors.'77  But the
Court  held  they  did  not  make  it  less  likely  that  the  defendants  acted
unilaterally, or more likely they conspired.'78
The answer, such as it is, is to require plaintiffs to plead facts that, if
true, give rise to a reasonable  inference that the observed parallel conduct
was the product of a conspiracy.  The implications of this answer are more
dramatic than they appear to be at first glance.  The economic analysis of
oligopoly  theory,  the  modern  understanding  of which  can  be  traced to
Stigler's  seminal  1964  article,  "A  Theory  of  Oligopoly,''179  turns  on
structural  features  of markets  that  make  collusion  more  likely.8°  But
structural  market  features  are  neutral  facts  under  a  legal  regime  that
requires "some  setting suggesting the agreement necessary to make out a §
1 claim."''  Courts have refused to adopt wholesale the economic definition
of conspiracy,  carving  out  from  it  the  broad  swath  of conduct  that  is

consciously parallel rather than explicitly conspiratorial.'82  Legal  doctrine
thus  narrows  considerably,  vis-d-vis  economic  theory,  the  sort  of
allegations that will suffice to state a Sherman One claim.' 3
As noted  above,  at the  margins,  facts that rise to  the level of being
plus factors  are easy to  define.  The  Twombly  plaintiffs'  quote  from one
defendant's  CEO  was  most  consistent  with  that  defendant's  making  a
unilateral business  decision, but certainly a quote  that was more concrete
and  damning  ("we  met  and  decided  on  prices")-perhaps  from  a
disgruntled  former  employee-might  be  sufficient.  Notably,  Justice
Stevens in dissent in Twombly argued discovery was essential to determine
whether  the  CEO's  quote  was  indeed  neutral. 84   Allegations  of trade
association involvement were neutral, but allegations of a secret meeting in
a smoke-filled room would be indicative of a conspiracy.'85  Allegations of
joint  refusal  to  enter  one another's  markets  were  neutral,  but  the  same
allegations of failure to enter, in a market in which the prevailing norm was
vigorous entry and exit, might be very different.'86  Allegations  of parallel
price  structures  are neutral,  but allegations of parallel  and irrational  price
structures might be sufficient.'87  This description of the shades of gray in
the plus factor framework demonstrates the impossibility of splitting hairs
with a chain saw.'88  The plus factor framework will always be difficult to

(noting the "fine distinction"  between "oligopolistic pricing alone," which  is permissible,
and price changes by one player in a concentrated market serving as signals, picked up by
its competitor).  For this reason it has been considered impossible to outlaw consciously
parallel pricing.  See Clamp-All Corp. v. Cast Iron Soil Pipe Inst., 851  F.2d 478, 484 (1st
Cir.  1988)  ("it  is  close  to  impossible  to  devise  a  judicially  enforceable  remedy  for656  U. PA. JOURNAL OF BUSINESS AND  EMPLOYMENT LAW  [Vol. 10:3

flirtation with per se rules shows that clarity may best be achieved through

Interestingly, some of the facts that are proposed to be legitimate plus
factors  would  require  economic  analysis  to  establish.'9'  It  is  not
newsworthy to observe that economic  analysis is a substantial  aspect of a
private  antitrust  suit in  the modem  era.  Economic  analysis  is  regularly
employed  on  questions  ranging  from  defining  the  relevant  market  to
establishing antitrust injury.  "In antitrust litigation, the factual complexity
and economic  nature  of the  issues  involved  require  the  presentation  of
economic  expert  testimony  in  all  but  a  few  cases."' 92   In  the  case  of
conspiracies  under  Sherman  One,  at  least  since  Matsushita, economic
principles have been imbedded in the governing substantive rule of law.'93
A possible implication of defining the pleading requirement based on
the substantive elements of the offense is that plaintiffs may be required, in
the  absence  of the  ability  to  make  direct  allegations  of conspiracy,  to
produce an economic expert affidavit supporting their complaint.94  Justice

C.  Recent PleadingP ractice
Twombly  has  had  an  impact  extending  far  beyond  the  substantive
Sherman  One  arena,  evidenced  by the  number  of citations  the  case  has
enjoyed among the lower courts since the opinion came down in May 2007.
Within a year of its being handed down,  Twombly has been cited by U.S.
tribunals more than 4800 times. 19  That number is more meaningful  when
compared to the three other antitrust cases decided in the 2006 Term by the
Supreme  Court-Weyerhaeuser, Credit Suisse v.  Billing, and Leegin-all
of which might have been thought to be higher profile than Twombly when
certiorari  was granted.198  Taken together, in approximately  the same time
period, those cases have been cited 70 times by U.S. tribunals.'99  A better
comparison that also paints a dramatic (if somewhat less so) picture,  is to
the other pleading cases from the 2006 Supreme Court Term, Tellabs, Inc.
v.  Makor Issues & Rights, Ltd.00  and Erickson v. Pardus2.'  Tellabs has
informed the decisions of 186 tribunals since the opinion was  issued, and
Erickson has been cited by 1189 courts.202  This loose bundle of statistics
tells at a minimum that Twombly is having an impact far beyond the scope
of the Sherman One claim, with which it ostensibly deals.203

The extent of its actual impact in the Sherman One arena is difficult to
evaluate.  This Article notes above that the idea of true "notice" pleading in
the antitrust arena has something of an urban legend quality.2°4  Many pre-
Twombly influential decisions exist in which courts have required pleading
that would satisfy the  Twombly standard.  Judge Boudin's opinion in DM
Research, Inc. v.  College of American Pathologists25  is  the leading  pre-
Twombly  authority  on pleading  a  Sherman  One  conspiracy.  The  court
refused to sanction the fishing expedition that would entail from permitting
a conclusory allegation of "conspiracy"  to entitle the plaintiff to discovery
to  determine  what facts  demonstrated  the  conspiracy.  "[T]he  discovery
process  is  not  available  where,  at  the  complaint  stage,  a  plaintiff has
nothing more than unlikely speculations.  While this may mean that a civil
plaintiff must do more detective work in advance, the reason  is to protect
society from the costs of highly unpromising litigation.2°6
In  Car Carriers, Inc.  v.  Ford Motor  Co.,207  the  Seventh  Circuit
rejected  as  insufficient  the  allegation  that  "'defendants  and  their  co-
conspirators  entered  into  contracts  and  engaged  in  a  continuing
combinations  [sic]  and conspiracies  to  restrain  trade  in  the  business  of
providing  haulaway  motor  transportation  for  new  Ford  automobiles.' 208
The  Car Carriers court  was  swayed  by  "the  costs  of modem  federal
antitrust  litigation  and  the  increasing  caseload  of the  federal  courts"  in
holding  that  the  allegation  of a  legal  conclusion was  insufficient.2 9   In
addition, Judge Posner wrote in Sutliff, Inc. v. Donavan Cos. 210 that Conley
"has  never  been  taken  literally."21'  That  approach  comports  with  the

Supreme  Court's  own  recognition  in  Associated General Contractors,

The recent conclusion of the Second Circuit in In re Elevator Antitrust
Litigation213  that, after  Twombly,  allegations  of parallel  conduct  coupled
with  conclusory  allegations  of  a  conspiracy-allegations  nearly
indistinguishable  from  those  the  same  court  had  held  sufficient  in
Twombly-is  not  path  breaking  in  light  of the  depth  of pre-Twombly
precedent  on  conspiracy  claims  generally  and  Sherman  One  claims
specifically.214  It  is true,  however, that the Second Circuit's approach  to
pleading Sherman One in Elevators is diametrically opposed to that court's
approach prior to reversal in Twombly.215
The Ninth Circuit has reached post-Twombly a result not inconsistent
with the pre-Twombly DM Research precedent.  In Kendall v.  Visa U.S.A.,
Inc., allegations that the defendants agreed, unaccompanied  by allegations
giving rise to  an  inference  of an agreement,  were  insufficient  to  state  a
216
claim.
In  In  re Late Fee and Over-Limit Fee Litigation in  the  Northern
District  of California,217  allegations  of "lockstep  pricing"  of late  fees,
together  with  allegations  of  opportunity  and  incentive  to, collude  and
conclusory allegations of agreement, were insufficient to meet the Sherman
One  standard  post-Twombly.218   The  court  also  noted  features  of the
complaint,  including  the  conclusory nature  of the  conspiracy  allegations
and the pleading of facts, which themselves provided innocent explanations
for the  parallel  conduct  alleged,  that  should  have  encouraged  dismissal
under such cases as Sutliff or DM Research.  In In re Graphics Processing
Units Antitrust Litigation, the  Northern  District  of California  held  that
allegations  of  parallel  pricing  and  parallel  product  releases  were

insufficient  to  survive  a  motion  to  dismiss  post-Twombly.21 9   Those
holdings would not be surprising even in the pre-Twombly world.
But Twombly does not spell the end of Sherman One litigation.220  This
Article discusses above the sorts of plus factors that should be sufficient to
permit a claim to proceed.221  Plaintiffs in Pennsylvania and California have
been able to clear the hurdle.  In In re OSB Antitrust Litigation, the Eastern
District  of Pennsylvania  held  that  allegations  of secret  meetings  and  a
published  price  list  were  sufficient  to  survive  the motion  to  dismiss.222
Likewise,  in In re Rubber Chemicals Antitrust Litigation, allegations  of
parallel pricing,  together with allegations of meetings, including who was
present and how they were involved in fixing prices, were sufficient.223
IV.  CONCLUSION
Potential  criticisms  of the  approach  to  pleading  the  Sherman  One
claim  discussed  in  this  Article  abound.  The  application  of Rule  8,
according  to its terms, to the  substantive  antitrust rules has the  effect of
making more difficult the task for private plaintiffs in entering the litigation
arena.  That is more so because antitrust conspiracy claims, at least, involve
conduct that is secretive in nature.  The defendants are also the gatekeepers
of the kind of information necessary  to  satisfy the pleading  requirement.
Those  two  factors  produce  dramatic  information  asymmetries.  Justice
Stevens discussed in his dissent (in a portion which Justice  Ginsburg did
not join) that the result is to protect "antitrust defendants-who  in this case
are some of the wealthiest corporations in our economy-from the burdens
of pretrial discovery., 224  Those concerns  ignore  fundamentals  about the
legal and regulatory scheme.
Telecom regulation and antitrust have had an uneasy relationship since
1996.  When  the  Telecom  Act was  passed,  it  was predictable  that  the
requirements  of  interconnectivity  would  present  exclusionary  conduct
concerns,  as  competitors  sought  to  enter  new  markets  and  incumbents

allegations could lead to a conclusion of coincidence rather than conspiracy).
220.  But cf  Thomas,  supra note  16 (draft  at  7-8) (arguing that after  the trilogy  of
summary judgment decisions in 1986, which included the Matsushita decision, "the courts
exponentially increased their use of summary judgment," particularly in antitrust cases, and
that the same should be expected for the motion to dismiss after Twombly).

fixing conspiracy.").

dissenting).2008] PRIVATE ANTITRUST CONSPIRACY CLAIMS
sought to keep them out.  So they did, and in Verizon Communications Inc.
v. Law Offices of Curtis V. Trinko,n5 the Supreme Court held there was no
place  for  a  Sherman  Two  suit  in  the  regulatory  scheme.16   One  might
wonder whether the same rule could be applied to the Sherman One claim
raised  in  Twombly.  The  Supreme  Court  noted  that  some  of plaintiffs'
allegations  supporting  their  conspiracy  claims  were  the  result  of  the
changing regulatory  scheme.  That being  so, perhaps,  like Sherman Two,
the  Sherman  One  claims  should  be  approached  with  particular
circumspection in that particular industry.
What is clear about antitrust claims in general, and their application in
this  industry  specifically,  is  that  the  substantive  law  imposes  a  heavy
burden  on  plaintiffs.  It  does  so  to  protect  against  the  direct  harm  to
individual defendants and the broader economic consequences of punishing
commercial activity.  Unlike the civil rights claims at issue in the Supreme
Court's  other  recent  pleading  cases,  where  individual  dignity  of  the
plaintiffs is implicated, private suits under the antitrust laws primarily serve
the  purpose  of  vindicating  broader  economic  interests.  The  remedy
available  serves  as  an  incentive-perhaps  a  poorly  designed  one 
2-to
encourage private plaintiffs to incur the expense.  But it is the public right
at stake, not the individual remedy, that is the primary thrust of the cause of
action.  Thus,  imposing  strict  standards for private  claims  as  a matter of
substantive antitrust law-with the effect of making it harder to survive the
procedural  hurdle  of a  motion  to  dismiss2S-is a  necessary  protection
against  misaligned  incentives.  That  check  would  be  undermined  by  a
contrary  rule that  allowed claims  to proceed despite  the  failure  to plead
elements.  The Twombly Court struck a substantially correct balance.

226.  See id. at 412-16 ("The 1996 Act is, in an important respect, much more ambitious
than the antitrust laws. It attempts 'to eliminate the monopolies enjoyed by the inheritors of
AT&T's  local  franchises.'  Section 2 of the  Sherman Act, by contrast,  seeks merely to
prevent unlawful monopolization. It would be a serious mistake to conflate the two goals.").
227.  See Huffman, supra note 2, at 114 ("little incentive exists for private plaintiffs to
limit  their  claims,  so  the  remedy  does  not  result  in  too  great  of deterrence  by  the
defendant.").
228.  Cf Twombly,  127 S. Ct. at 1975 (Stevens, J., dissenting) (accusing  the majority of
"an interpretation of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) that seems to be driven by the
majority's appraisal of the plausibility of the ultimate factual allegation").
