Abstract 
Canadian courts draw a tenuous distinction between expert scientific evidence and what they 
characterize as specialized knowledge gained through the expert witness’s experience, training, 
and research. This characterization is based on unclear criteria and has significant consequences. 
Notably, specialized knowledge regularly receives considerably less scrutiny than that which is 
characterized as science, while still often serving as powerful inculpatory evidence in criminal 
trials. Moreover, specialized knowledge is often provided by figures that carry an air of 
authority, like police officers and scientists. This article focuses on the leading opinion on 
specialized knowledge, the Court of Appeal for Ontario’s decision in R v Abbey. An analysis of 
Abbey’s application to three fields of contested specialized knowledge (including the evidence 
the Abbey Court admitted, but fresh evidence revealed as fundamentally unreliable) provides two 
general insights. First, while Abbey could be interpreted as providing for a flexible and probing 
analysis of all expert evidence, courts have often relied on it to justify giving almost no scrutiny 
to specialized knowledge. Second, this review of the post-Abbey jurisprudence suggests that 
scrutiny focused on the transparency of the expert’s data and analysis, and whether that analysis 
can reliably be applied to the relevant factual question, may provide a valuable way to evaluate 
expertise.

Part I. Introduction 
  Expert evidence is both immensely important to legal adjudication, but equally 
dangerous. Experts, veiled in their authority and in their (often) superior knowledge, can exert 
great influence over the trier of fact. One method of safeguarding the trial against prejudicial 
expert evidence is to exclude it when it is not demonstrably reliable. When determining how to 
scrutinize the reliability of expert evidence, Canadian courts frequently engage in the 
(misleading and unhelpful) task of characterization. They characterize expertise as either science 
or “specialized knowledge” flowing from the witness’s training, experience, and research.1 Both 
this categorization system and the fact that specialized knowledge regularly receives insufficient 
scrutiny have received considerable criticism.2 The leading guidance on the task of assessing 
specialized knowledge is found in a provincial appellate decision, R v Abbey (Abbey #1).3 Abbey 
                                                 
1 See, for instance, R v Abbey, 2009 ONCA 624 at paras 108-109, 97 OR (3d) 330 [Abbey ONCA 2009], which 
distinguished between the “product of scientific inquiry” and “specialized knowledge gained through experience and 
specialized training in the relevant field”. See also R v Aitken, 2012 BCCA 134 at paras 79-80, 92 CR (6th) 384 
[Aitken] comparing an opinion that is “scientific in nature” to specialized knowledge; R v Awer, 2016 ABCA 128 at 
paras 32-49, 2016 CarswellAlta 827 [Awer ABCA], rev'd (1995), 2017 SCC 2, [2017] 1 SCR 83 [Awer SCC]; 
Sidney N Lederman, Alan W Bryant & Michelle K Fuerst, The Law of Evidence in Canada, 4th ed (Ontario: 
LexisNexis, 2014) at 808-809 [Lederman]. Formally, expert evidence receives additional scrutiny if it is “novel or 
contested science or science used for a novel purpose”. White Burgess Langille Inman v Abbott and Haliburton Co, 
2015 SCC 23 at para 23, [2015] 2 SCR 182 [White Burgess]. Even this categorization, however, has been called into 
doubt by recent Supreme Court jurisprudence and the definition of novel science has never been clear, see Author 
citation (2017) at 18-19, 47-50. Although, within this article, I am critical of a categorical approach to expert 
evidence and ultimately advocate for more flexibility, I will use the term “specialized knowledge”. This is because 
the term was featured heavily in Abbey (which is this article’s focus) and has been widely used in the subsequent 
case law. 
2 Emma Cunliffe & Gary Edmond, “Gaitkeeping in Canada: Mis-steps in Assessing the Reliability of Expert 
Testimony” (2013) 92 Can Bar Rev 327 at 361 [Cunliffe & Edmond Gaitkeeping]: “…little light is shed on 
reliability by trying to determine whether a technique is novel (or established) or classifying it as a matter of 
professional experience (as opposed to ‘scientific’)”; Lisa Dufraimont, “New Challenges for the Gatekeeper: The 
Evolving Law on Expert Evidence in Criminal Cases” (2012) 58:3&4 Crim LQ 531 at 546 [Dufraimont Gatekeeper] 
saying R v Abbey provided for a move away from a “simplistic and value-laden dichotomy between ‘hard’ and ‘soft’ 
science” – I will suggest that while Abbey should (and could) have had this effect, much of the time this has not been 
the case; Gary Edmond & Kent Roach, “A Contextual Approach to the Admissibility of the State’s Forensic Science 
and Medical Evidence” (2011) 61 UTLJ 343 at 399 [Edmond & Roach]: “…whether we can develop useful means 
of demarcating science from other types of knowledge and experience are distractions”; Author citation (2016) at 
548.

recently gained attention for another reason – fresh evidence revealed that the expert evidence 
admitted in that decision was deeply flawed. In this article, I will evaluate how Abbey has been 
interpreted and applied, and then suggest how it ought to be interpreted and applied.   
  There is much at stake in the decision to admit or exclude the evidence that courts have 
frequently characterized as specialized knowledge. Notably, and spanning fields as diverse as 
social science and police experience, specialized knowledge regularly appears as inculpatory 
evidence in criminal trials.4 The trial judge’s gatekeeper role is especially important in such 
cases because the defence is often underfunded and thus at a disadvantage in cross-examining the 
expert evidence and calling its own witness.5 Still, for the reasons I will discuss throughout this 
article, courts have not always rigorously scrutinized specialized knowledge.6

Roach, supra note 2 at 391-395; Cunliffe & Edmond Gaitkeeping, supra note 2. Evidence that would likely be 
characterized specialized knowledge in current Canadian courts was present in the wrongful conviction of Guy Paul 
Morin, see Ontario, The Commission on Proceedings Involving Guy Paul Morin: Report (Toronto: Ministry of the 
Attorney General, 1998) vol 1 (The Honourable Fred Kaufman, C.M., Q.C.) at 56-57. This was evidence from a dog 
behaviour expert. See also Author citation (2017) for a trend whereby evidence similar to that of the dog expert’s is 
being tendered and admitted under the more permissive rules for lay opinion. For a review of specialized knowledge 
evidence in the United States, see: David H Kaye, David E Bernstein & Jennifer L Mnookin, The New Wigmore

(Partial) Failure of the Daubert Revolution” (2008) 93 Iowa Law Review 451 at 480-489 [Bernstein], referring to 
specialized knowledge evidence as “connoisseur” evidence. Note that the effect of culture and context makes 
generalizations across the U.S. and Canadian evidence jurisprudence precarious, see David M Paciocco, “Context, 
culture and the law of expert evidence” (2001) 24 Advoc Q 42. In Australia, see Kristy A Martire & Gary Edmond,

admitted on consent at trial with no cross-examination.”.

(i.e., when it is not necessary) and excluding it for bias. For necessity, see: David M Paciocco, “Coping with Expert

This article examines the impact of Abbey #1 on three forms of contentious expert 
evidence: social science, forensic science, and police experience. I seek to achieve two general 
aims. First, I will suggest that Abbey #1 has not had the impact that it could have had and attempt 
to explain why that is the case. In particular, there was a hope that Abbey #1 would have been 
used by trial courts as guidance in flexibly assessing the reliability of expert evidence in a way 
that did not require a nebulous exercise in categorizing the evidence as scientific or not.7 
Unfortunately, many post-Abbey courts have not taken up that challenge. Rather, the decisions 
frequently do not engage with Abbey at all or simply refer to it as a means to avoid exerting 
closer scrutiny by simply characterizing the evidence as non-scientific. These courts appear to 
either see the reliability factors (discussed below) established by Abbey as inapplicable or they 
overemphasize the portions of the judgment that were deferential to the expert’s field and 
experience within that field.8 In other words, Abbey has simply served as an off-switch for any 
substantive reliability scrutiny.  
Second, this exploration into the post-Abbey expert evidence jurisprudence provides 
some insight into how courts ought to evaluate expert evidence. In particular, Abbey’s guidance 
regarding the openness and transparency of expert knowledge production has been especially 
useful in providing the legal scaffolding for recent judgments that examined expert evidence 
with a critical eye.

8 See Cunliffe & Edmond Gaitkeeping, supra note 2 at 351 making this observation in their analysis of the Aitken 
case: “…the BC Court of Appeal appears to have misunderstood Doherty JA’s holding in Abbey that the reliability 
of an expert’s opinion should be assessed according to the standards that are relevant to his or her field.”. 7 
 
Because my two aims (an evaluation of Abbey’s effect and the lessons that flow from its 
failures and successes) permeate the remainder of this article, it may be useful to provide a 
roadmap for the reader. Following this introduction, I will detail Abbey itself and contextualize it 
in the rest of Canada’s expert evidence landscape (Part II).  
Part III begins my exploration of Abbey’s impact on three fields of expert evidence. Part 
III discusses Abbey’s impact on social scientific evidence, primarily on the sociological expertise 
at issue in the Abbey proceedings and in a case in which the same expert was proffered by the 
defence. In these cases, the courts engaged with the reliability of the evidence but may have 
given too little emphasis to transparency and too much to the appearance that the expert followed 
the standards of the field. In Part IV, I examine forensic scientific evidence. Here, Abbey has 
frequently served as an exemption to any substantive reliability scrutiny by allowing parties to 
avoid the scrutiny that novel or contested science typically receives. For evidence that is not 
susceptible to formal testing, I suggest reliable expertise may be inferred in some circumstances. 
Part V then examines Abbey in the context of police knowledge. I find that courts often do not 
apply Abbey at all, and simply advert to the expert’s general experience and status as a police 
officer. However, when they do engage with Abbey, demanding a transparent knowledge base 
provides some safeguards as to reliability. Part VI concludes with a summary of my main 
findings through what I describe as a “transparent proficiency” approach to expert evidence. 
Part II. Abbey and the Reliability of Specialized Knowledge 
  Abbey #1 was decided during a sensitive time in the development of Canada’s law of 
expert opinion evidence. It was heard just months after Justice Goudge’s Inquiry into Pediatric 
Forensic Pathology in Ontario, which detailed, among other things, scientifically invalid 8 
 
practices that contributed to at least 14 wrongful convictions.9 At the same time, Canadian courts 
were subjecting evidence from the experimental sciences to increasing scrutiny.10  
Situating Abbey: The Beginning of the Road 
The foundations of modern expert opinion law in Canada are found in R v Mohan.11 In 
that case, Justice Sopinka provided four requirements: (1) relevance; (2) necessity in assisting the 
factfinder; (3) no other applicable exclusionary rules; and (4) a properly qualified expert.12 An 
opinion passing those hurdles must also withstand the trial judge’s residual discretion to exclude 
evidence when the opinion’s costs (e.g., potential to confuse and overwhelm the factfinder) 
outweigh its benefits to the trial process (e.g., assistance to the factfinder).13 Further, Justice 
Sopinka said that expert opinions advancing a “novel scientific theory or technique” should be 
able to withstand “special scrutiny” to determine if they are reliable.14  
  Following Mohan, two Supreme Court of Canada cases elaborated on what special 
reliability scrutiny entailed. These two decisions followed the U.S. Supreme Court’s landmark 
decision, Daubert v Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals Inc.15 Daubert added to the trial judge’s 
gatekeeping responsibility, holding that the judge should take neither the expert’s nor the field of

expertise’s word for it that the science is reliable.16 The U.S. Supreme Court provided four 
factors to assist in this gatekeeping endeavor: (1) whether and how the science had been tested; 
(2) the error rate of the science; (3) the peer-review and publication status of the science; and (4) 
whether the science is generally accepted in the scientific community from which it came.17  
  Daubert was applied by the Supreme Court of Canada in R v J (LJ).18 The Supreme Court 
characterized an expert’s psycho-physiological tests (designed to ascertain whether a person is a 
pedophile) as novel science.19 Among other shortcomings, the opinion was insufficiently tested 
and error-prone, and thus inadmissible.20 In R v Trochym, decided two years before Abbey #1, 
the Supreme Court again relied on the Daubert factors. This time, the Court excluded testimony 
from a witness because her memories had been retrieved and clarified through the non-novel (but 
contested) practice of hypnosis.21  
Before addressing the expert opinion in Abbey, it is worth elaborating on the case’s place 
in the pantheon of opinion evidence decisions. First, Abbey’s influence has gone well beyond its 
treatment of specialized knowledge. The decision, written by Justice Doherty, has been widely 
cited for the direction that trial courts should establish the scope of expert evidence and actively 
ensure experts do not go beyond that scope.22 Moreover, Abbey employed a two-step formulation 
of the Mohan test. The two-step process drew favour from courts across Canada and was 
                                                 
16 Prior to Daubert, the leading federal case in the U.S. was Frye v United States, 54 App DC 46, 293 F 1013 (1923), 
which provided a more deferential standard whereby judges determined if the science was generally accepted in the 
scientific community. Frye was never the law in Canada: R v J(TE), 25 WCB (2d) at para 74, 1994 CarswellOnt 
3370 [JTE].

eventually adopted, with minor modifications, by the Supreme Court in White Burgess Langille 
Inman v Abbott and Haliburton Co.23  
White Burgess is the most current thorough enunciation of the expert evidence rules. 
Under the first step of the test, the opinion must meet four preconditions: logical relevance, 
absence of an exclusionary rule, a properly qualified expert, and necessity (note Abbey had 
relegated necessity to the second stage).24 Further, novel or contested science must receive 
special reliability scrutiny (likely under Daubert; White Burgess left the treatment of anything 
that could not be characterized as novel or contested science, ostensibly, to Abbey).25 If the 
evidence passes the first step, only then does it receive the discretionary costs-benefits weighing, 
which also includes reliability and any bias or partiality the expert may possess.26  
Second, after Daubert, U.S. courts have also struggled with expert evidence that does not 
lend itself easily to formal testing.27 The leading case on this issue is Kumho Tire Co., Ltd. v 
Carmichael, a 1999 decision of the U.S. Supreme Court.28 In that case, the Court held that all 
expert evidence should have a reliable basis and thus the Daubert factors should be flexibly 
applied to these opinions.29 The Court also remarked that it was important that the witness use 
                                                 
23 Supra note 1. Another important post-Abbey development is the Supreme Court’s decision in R v Sekhon, 2014 
SCC 15, [2014] 1 SCR 272 [Sekhon]. That case will be explored in Part V. For a helpful description of Abbey’s 
reformulation of the Mohan test, see the annotation (Lisa Dufraimont) accompanying R v Boswell, 2011 
CarswellOnt 2428. 
24 White Burgess, ibid at para 23.  
25 White Burgess cites the paragraphs of JLJ detailing the Daubert analysis. 
26 According to White Burgess, a threshold level of partiality is required at the first step (a properly qualified expert). 
A review of the post-White Burgess case law suggests that partiality may a fertile ground for challenging experts 
going forward, see Cunliffe Paradigm, supra note 6. 
27 For commentary on the Daubert-Kumho interstitial period, see Edward J Imwinkelried, “The Next Step After 
Daubert: Developing a Similarly Epistemological approach to Ensuring the Reliability of Non-Scientific 
Testimony” (1994) 15 Cardozo Law Review 2271. 
28 526 US 137 (1999) [Kumho]. 
29 Ibid at 141, 147: “In Daubert, this court held that Federal Rule of Evidence 702 imposes a special obligation upon 
a trial judge to ‘ensure that any and all scientific testimony... is not only relevant but reliable.’ The initial question 
before us is whether this basic gatekeeping obligation applies only to ‘scientific’ evidence or to all expert testimony. 
We, like the parties, believe that it applies to all expert testimony.” 11 
 
“the same level of intellectual rigor” as experts in his or her field. Influential American 
commentators and academics have criticized a post-Kumho trend whereby some courts have 
seemed overly reliant on these standards within the relevant field, thus allowing dubious 
specialized knowledge to pass the gatekeeper.30 D. Michael Risinger has labeled standards which 
defer to the internal quality controls of a field, as “guild tests”.31 Kumho, as we will see below, 
had a clear impact on the Court of Appeal’s decision in Abbey #1. 
R v Abbey: The Tattoo and the Sociologist 
Abbey is widely regarded as Canada’s leading decision on specialized knowledge. This is 
not to say that it was the first Canadian decision to suggest a broad role for reliability in the 
assessment of all expert evidence.32 These cases, however, did not elaborate on how reliability 
should be assessed and none has been as influential as Abbey.33 Moreover, it should be noted that 
some pre-Abbey decisions denied there was any reliability requirement (and some continue to do 
so, as I will detail in Parts III-V).34

[Modern Scientific Evidence]; Risinger, supra note 4 at 775-778. Similarly, in Australia, academics have eschewed 
a general acceptance standard for one focused on demonstrable reliability, see Gary Edmond, “Forensic Scientific 
Evidence and the conditions for Rational (Jury) Evaluation” (2015) 39 Melbourne University Law Review 77

33 Note McIntosh serves as a de facto bar to eyewitness identification expertise, holding it failed Mohan’s necessity 
criterion. It was also critical of the field’s (applied cognitive psychology) scientific status. See Dufraimont

34 See R v O(N), 2009 ABCA 75 at para 21, 2 Alta LR (5th) 72 [ON]: “The only requirement for the admission of 
expert opinion is that the "expert witness possesses special knowledge and experience going beyond that of the trier 
of fact […] The admissibility of [expert] evidence does not depend on the means by which the skill was acquired." 
(quoting pre-Mohan decisions). Troublingly, some still deny a reliability requirement, see R v Woodcock, 2010 
ONSC 671 at para 12, 87 WCB (2d) 630 [Woodcock].  12 
 
R v Abbey encompasses a series of murder trials and appeals set it the context of violent 
gang wars in the Toronto-area during the early 2000s.35 Warren Abbey, an alleged gang member, 
was accused of murdering Simeon Peter. Under the Crown’s theory, Abbey shot Peter, confusing 
him with a rival gang member who had robbed Abbey earlier. Identity was the central issue at 
trial.36 Peter’s killer had followed him down a Toronto-area street and shot him at least three 
times.37  
Abbey was acquitted at the first trial after Justice Archibald excluded the Crown’s key 
expert witness, a sociologist named Dr. Mark Totten.38 Totten would have opined that a teardrop 
tattoo Abbey received after the killing meant he had killed a member of an opposing gang: “it is 
clear to me that Warren Abbey’s teardrop tattoo on his right cheek below the eye represents the 
fact that he killed a rival gang member, most likely in 2004”.39 Alternatively, Totten would 
provide more general evidence about the three possible meanings of teardrop tattoos within gang 
culture: the bearer had suffered the loss of a family or fellow gang member, the bearer had 
served time in prison, or the bearer had killed a rival gang member.40 
Justice Archibald, at the first trial, excluded the totality of Totten’s opinion pursuant to 
his gatekeeping discretion.41 In particular, he found that Totten’s evidence was not reliable42 and 
                                                 
35 See R v Abbey, 2017 ONCA 640 at paras 13-41, 2017 CarswellOnt 12134 [Abbey ONCA 2017] for a summary of 
the proceedings.

carried three possible meanings: (1) killing a rival gang member; (2) losing a loved one or gang member or; (3) 
spending time in prison. Due to the other facts of the case, (1) was the only plausible option of the three. See Abbey

42 See a succinct summary of Justice Archibald’s reliability analysis at ibid para 4. 13 
 
that it cut right to the ultimate issue (i.e., identity).43 As to reliability, Justice Archibald 
characterized Totten’s evidence as “novel science” and thus applied the Daubert factors to 
“measure the reliability of this methodology”.44 First, while Totten had interviewed 
approximately 290 gang members, it was unclear if those experiences could be applied to Abbey. 
More specifically, Totten’s sample was not random45 and other than screening out some gang 
members who seemed like they might lie, his inclusion criteria were unclear.46 As a result, no 
reasonable error rate could be ascribed to Totten’s conclusion. In other words, there was no way 
of systematically comparing Totten’s gang research to the context of the killing.47  
Justice Doherty, writing for the Court in Abbey #1, held that the trial judge erred in 
excluding Totten’s evidence and he did so for two general reasons: the opinion overreached but 
could have been circumscribed as to be admissible, and it should not have been judged against a 
rigid scientific standard (i.e., Daubert). As to the first reason, Justice Doherty seemed to agree 
with the lower court decision that Totten could not opine on the reason that Abbey got his 
particular tattoo (the Crown’s primary position).48 He held, however, that Totten could provide 
framework evidence about the three possible meanings of teardrop tattoos in gang culture.49 
The distinction drawn by the Court of Appeal is well-known in evidence law scholarship. 
David Faigman, John Monahan and Christopher Slobogin refer to the problem as “G2i”, or the 
difficulty of reasoning from group (G) data to the individual (i) level.50 To drastically simplify

this line of research, evidence researchers tend to agree that there is insufficient data in many 
fields to reliably individuate group findings to specific cases.51  
The second major mistake the trial court made, according to the Court of Appeal, was 
excluding the group-level research. This was Totten’s conclusion about the three potential 
meanings of teardrop tattoos, drawn from the years of field research that Totten had conducted. 
The Court held that Justice Archibald should not have applied the Daubert factors because 
Totten’s research was not scientific in nature: “It was not scientific. It was not novel. And it was 
not a theory.”52 Rather, Justice Doherty characterized the evidence as “specialized knowledge 
gained through extensive research”.53  
Importantly, the specialized knowledge characterization was not the end of the analysis. 
Justice Doherty held that the opinion still needed to be reliable, but that the reliability inquiry 
should be conducted according to the “nature of the opinion”.54 He then provided nine questions 
to assist with that inquiry.55 Approximately half of these factors deferred to the standards of the 
field of expertise. The others were directed at accurate recording of any data, clarity of 
reasoning, use of methodology, and collecting data independent of the case. I will revisit these 
factors throughout this article, so they are worth reproducing in full now:56 
• To what extent is the field in which the opinion is offered a recognized discipline, profession 
or area of specialized training?

Chicago Law Review 417 [Faigman G2i]. 
51 For example, applied cognitive psychologists can provide reliable evidence about the factors that influence 
eyewitness memory, but they cannot say, with any degree of certainty, how likely a particular eyewitness memory is 
to be accurate. See Faigman G2i, ibid at 432-434.

• To what extent is the work within that field subject to quality assurance measures and 
appropriate independent review by others in the field? 
• What are the particular expert's qualifications within that discipline, profession or area of 
specialized training? 
• To the extent that the opinion rests on data accumulated through various means such as 
interviews, is the data accurately recorded, stored and available? 
• To what extent are the reasoning processes underlying the opinion and the methods used to 
gather the relevant information clearly explained by the witness and susceptible to critical 
examination by a jury? 
• To what extent has the expert arrived at his or her opinion using methodologies accepted by 
those working in the particular field in which the opinion is advanced? 
• To what extent do the accepted methodologies promote and enhance the reliability of the 
information gathered and relied on by the expert? 
• To what extent has the witness, in advancing the opinion, honoured the boundaries and limits 
of the discipline from which his or her expertise arises? 
• To what extent is the proffered opinion based on data and other information gathered 
independently of the specific case or, more broadly, the litigation process? 
Critically, Justice Doherty went on to quote Kumho and emphasize the much maligned “same 
intellectual rigour” language (i.e., the portion of the judgment that hinted at a guild test).57  
  Here, it may be useful to summarize the framework that Abbey now fits into.58 Under 
White Burgess, expert evidence must be logically relevant, necessary, absent an exclusionary 
rule, and from a properly qualified expert (who meets a threshold level of unbiasedness, 
impartiality and independence).59 Then, at the second stage, the benefits of that evidence must 
outweigh the costs, a calculus that includes, necessity, reliability and bias. Novel or contested 
scientific evidence, which has never been clearly defined,60 receives special scrutiny under 
Daubert. Other expert evidence is (notionally) then subject to the guidelines in Abbey #1.

  Applying the nine reliability factors, the appellate court found that Justice Archibald had 
given insufficient weight to the fact that Totten’s opinion seemed to have used the well-
established social-scientific method of drawing inferences from interviews.61 Further, the 
defence had not challenged the recording of the data (although formally, the onus is on the party 
tendering opinion evidence to establish its admissibility) and Totten’s opinion was not too 
complex for the jury to scrutinize.62 Justice Doherty also noted that the data had been collected 
independently (years prior) to the case.63 As a result, the opinion was admissible. Totten gave his 
evidence in the second trial and Abbey was convicted of murder.64 
   In many cases, this would be the end of the story: an expert had provided (seemingly) 
powerful inculpatory evidence; the defence had not produced its own expert but had cross-
examined the expert about the reliability of his method; much judicial ink had been spilled about 
the admissibility of the opinion. Indeed, this is often much more than an accused can expect.65 In 
Abbey, however, the case went on to follow an even more aberrant path – in the years after 
Abbey’s conviction, Totten provided expert evidence for a co-accused in R v Gager.66 In that 
case, the Crown’s probing cross-examination of Totten revealed serious flaws in his 
methodology that the earlier Abbey proceedings had failed to unearth.   
Part III. Social Science and the Importance of Transparency 
The revelation from Gager that much of Totten’s evidence was fundamentally flawed 
suggests that Totten’s use of  accepted standards within sociology may have been misleading. In

this section, I will review the flaws in Totten’s opinion and demonstrate that (besides some 
seemingly overt dishonesty) they are not very different from widespread scientific practices that 
have been criticized as part a movement in science towards more transparency and openness.67 
More generally, this section finds that the social sciences typically do draw some substantive 
reliability analysis. That analysis, however, should include more attention to the transparency of 
the expert’s methods, following from emerging guidelines from scientists, publishers and 
funding bodies.68 
In Gager, Totten’s evidence would have supported the defence’s contention that the co-
accused (Gager) was not a gang member, but merely a friend or affiliate of a gang. In assessing 
Totten’s evidence, Justice Clark applied the nine factors in Abbey #1.69 His analysis revealed an 
important tension in those factors: Totten appeared, for the most part, to be using accepted 
methods, but he seemed to have twisted those methods to arrive at the conclusion he was 
seeking.  
As to the standards in the field, Justice Clark noted that sociology was a recognized 
discipline with quality assurance measures.70 Moreover, he found that, by and large, Totten 
“arrived at his opinions using methods accepted by those working in the sociological field”71 and 
“honoured the boundaries and limits of his discipline.”72 Despite these concessions to accepted

70 Ibid at para 31. 
71 Ibid at para 56 
72 Ibid at para 63; The decision in Gager is replete with descriptions of Totten’s methods as well in keeping with 
generally accepted sociological practices. See ibid at para 32: “…he has both academic credentials as a sociologist 
along with considerable knowledge and experience concerning street gangs acquired within pursuit of his 
discipline.” Ibid at para 44: “Dr. Totten made much in his evidence on the voir dire of the fact that his writings are 
all peer reviewed. While that may be true, the fact remains that, except for two ongoing studies, for the most part, 18 
 
practices, Justice Clark was deeply critical of Totten’s data collection and retention practices (the 
fourth Abbey #1 factor).73 First, he found that Totten’s raw data had been destroyed, thus making 
it difficult to test his claims. This would have been useful because Totten’s summary and 
analysis evinced many inconsistencies. For instance, Totten (as he did in Abbey) made 
conclusions about the meaning of tattoos, but many of the studies he relied on did not seem to be 
about tattoos, nor did their protocols seem to include questions about tattoos.74  
Justice Clark further noted that the number of actual gang members in Totten’s sample 
was dubious because he had shifted his definition of what it means to be a gang member over 
time. As a result, by his most recent definition, only “10 to 20” of the 90 putative gang members 
presented in his report would now qualify as such and “[s]urprisingly, he could not be more 
precise than that.”75 Further, some aspects of the data collection seemed plainly implausible. 
Totten said that he had interviewed 309 participants in month, a number that, according to the 
Court’s math, would have made it difficult or impossible to have also slept and eaten.76  
Finally, Justice Clark questioned a category of gang affiliation (i.e., “long term friend” of 
the gang) that Totten used to suggest that Gager was not in the relevant gang, but rather tightly 
allied with it.77 In particular, Totten modified a diagram he had used in previous publications to 
                                                 
the data upon which his opinions rest has been destroyed.” Ibid at para 55: “Given the witnesses’ academic training, 
I am confident that he can clearly explain the methodology he employed to gather the data he did and the reasoning 
he used to interpret it in such a way that it can be critically examined by the jury.” Ibid at para 62: With the 
exception of the use of 519 as the overall sample size and the gathering of the data concerning the prevalence of 
tattoos other than the tear drop, the methodologies employed would appear to be in keeping with those recognized in 
the field of sociology.” 
73 Abbey ONCA 2009, supra note 1 at para 119: “To the extent that the opinion rests on data accumulated through 
various means such as interviews, is the data accurately recorded, stored and available?” 
74 Gager Totten, supra note 38 at para 45. Justice Clark remarked: … “…absent any record of what was asked, it 
strikes me that the validity of any data gathered in this fashion is questionable at best.” 
75 Ibid at para 49. 
76 Ibid at para 54. See Risinger, supra note 4 at 788 describing an expert who testified as to having performed over a 
million document examinations, a similarly impossible figure.

add that long term friend category.78 He also admitted that he had never written about this 
category prior to his expert report in Gager.79 According to Justice Clark, this apparently ad hoc 
characterization suggested partiality.80  
While Justice Clark accepted at several points that Totten had used the methodologies of 
his field, he did not do so universally.81 In particular, Justice Clark found it improbable that 
academic sociologists would inflate their sample sizes by exploiting flexible categories like gang 
membership and draw such strong conclusions about a tattoo’s meaning when such data did not 
seem to be planned or recorded.82 While Justice Clark was correct to independently question 
Totten’s methodological rigour, he would likely be surprised to find out that recent studies find 
that academic psychologists, ecologists, and biologists have admitted to using similar methods at 
rates approaching 60%.83 I will discuss these findings further below. 
  Totten’s cross-examination provided the fresh evidence Abbey needed to support an 
appeal in 2017.84 The Court ordered a third trial, finding that in light of the weaknesses exposed 
in Gager, Totten’s evidence was too unreliable to pass a gatekeeper’s weighing of the evidence’s 
risk of prejudice against its probative value.85 More specifically, as in Gager, Totten’s sample 
size (i.e., the number of interviews he conducted) was unverifiable and likely lower than he 
represented at trial.86 This was because he used a flexible definition of gang member and counted 
                                                 
78 Ibid at para 64. 
79 Ibid at para 74. 
80 Ibid at para 75. 
81 Ibid at paras 56-61. 
82 Justice Clark questioned whether it was acceptable to rely on data that was two decades old. 
83 See note 92 below. Further, current norms in many sciences do not require the scientist keep a public record of 
data (although it is a current reform proposed as part of the open science movement). Justice Clark expressed 
surprise at this practice of Totten’s but seemed to accept the practice. 
84 Abbey ONCA 2017, supra note 35. 
85 Ibid at para 121. 
86 Ibid at para 117. 20 
 
the same interviews as two separate data points, thus inflating his reported sample size.87 And, 
also as in Gager, there was no record – and it did not seem likely – that the interviewees were 
explicitly asked about their tattoos.88  
In holding that Totten’s evidence should be excluded, Justice Laskin, writing for the 
Court, adverted to the list of nine reliability factors in Abbey #1.89 He also referenced the Goudge 
Report’s recitation of 14 factors, which Justice Goudge extracted from R v Johnston.90 Justice 
Laskin noted two of those factors bore on appeal before the Court: the data being recorded 
accurately (from Abbey #1), and the opinion accurately representing the data and studies on 
which it is based (this factor does not actually appear in either list).91  
  As I mentioned above, some of the tactics Totten used to make his data seem more 
credible are unfortunately not entirely uncommon in science. They are known as “researcher 
degrees of freedom” or, in other words, flexibilities in the scientific process that do not amount 
to outright fraud but bias the scientific literature.92 They include excluding data in a manner that 
supports the researcher’s hypothesis, deciding to end data collection after a statistically 
significant result has been found, and using flexible definitions of key measures.93  
  Recent scientific reforms being implemented as part of the “open” or “reproducible 
science” movement can help control for (or at least illuminate) these researcher degrees of

freedom and allow for rational evaluation of the evidence.94 For instance, several leading 
journals now require authors to publish their raw data and materials to improve peer review and 
general scrutiny in the scientific community.95 Further, leading groups of scientists prescribe a 
practice known as “preregistration” whereby researchers publicly commit to a set of procedures 
that they cannot edit after data collection has started.96 The idea is not to constrain science, but to 
make any changes (like those Totten apparently made) transparent. I do not mean to say that 
open science would have served as a panacea in Abbey, but rather that – even today – orthodox 
standards in many scientific guilds do not include these important reforms.97   
  As to research fraud and data fabrication, the Abbey #2 Court expressly refrained from 
weighing in on Totten’s behaviour: “…it would be unfair to make the positive finding that 
Abbey urges us to make: Totten fabricated or concocted part of his research, or gave deliberately 
misleading testimony.”98 Still, the Court pulled few other punches, recounting Totten’s “false” 
reply in Gager to the question of whether he ever used the same interviews in different published 
studies.99  
  Indeed, inferring intentionality in bad science is challenging and should not be taken 
lightly. Perhaps the most important thing to note is that research finds that, depending on the 
specific activity, up to 60% of academic scientists anonymously admit to using researcher 
degrees of freedom (i.e., mainstream but error-prone scientific practices).100 Similar studies find

that only about 1% of researchers intentionally falsify or fabricate their data.101 As a result – and 
as I propose in Part VI – legal approaches aimed at reducing researcher degrees of freedom may 
help in promoting reliable expert evidence.  
  Moving beyond Totten’s evidence in Abbey and Gager, framework evidence from social 
scientists tendered by the defence have not seen their evidence treated any more favourably post-
Abbey.102 Some in the criminal law bar thought that Abbey would assist in admitting legally 
relevant academic psychology. Prior to Abbey, the most influential case to discuss the 
admissibility of the social scientific evidence was R v McIntosh. And McIntosh still stands as a 
controversial bar to the admission of expert psychological evidence on the fragility of eyewitness 
memory.103 McIntosh took a dim (and mistaken) view of psychology, questioning whether it was 
a recognized body of knowledge.104 Abbey, on the other had, appeared (at least facially) to be 
more accepting of social science.105

of Survey Data” (2009) 4:5 PLoS ONE. See also Sherkow, supra note 67 at 855 reporting that fraud was “extremely 
rare”. 
102 Courts, by and large, at least seem to see the applicability of Abbey #1 to social scientific expert evidence (unlike 
with police expertise, see Part V below). In sociology, see R v Shafia 2016 ONCA 812, 341 CCC (3d) 354.  In 
history, see Ross River Dena Council v Canada (Attorney General), 2014 YKSC 53, 249 ACWS (3d) 119. In 
criminology, see R v Orr, 2015 BCCA 88, 18 CR (7th) 158. In Orr, a criminologist would have explained why an 
alleged victim of human trafficking did not report her plight to the police immediately The Court of Appeal for 
British Columbia held that while the evidence did not need to meet scientific standards, it was from the “behavioural 
or ‘soft’ sciences” and thus Abbey applied. Orr at paras 2, 16-32. Courts may, however, take a permissive approach 
to admitting social science in bench trials. Recently, in R v Comeau, 2018 SCC 15 at para 40, the Supreme Court 
noted that part of a historian’s expert evidence did not meet Mohan’s necessity criterion for, in essence, being a legal 
opinion. The transparency approach that I discuss in Part VI would also help determine if the historian had surveyed 
a sufficient amount of the historical literature in forming his opinion.

104 “…I would have to be persuaded that the subject is a recognized branch of psychology.” McIntosh, supra note 32 
at para 19. To the contrary, it is very much a recognized branch of psychology. For instance, the Society for Applied 
Research in Memory and Cognition has existed since 1997: SARMAC, online: <http://www.sarmac.org/about/aims-
and-origin/>. 
105 See R v Jeanvenne, 2011 ONSC 7244 at para 50, 286 CCC (3d) 65 [Jeanvenne]. This was the defence’s argument 
in R v Frimpong, 2013 ONCA 243, CR (7th) 242 [Frimpong], R v Frimpong, Appellant’s Factum, Court file No 
C53147 at para 61, available online <https://osf.io/ukdqw/> [Frimpong Factum]. 23 
 
Abbey was not the game-changer that some wished for. For example, the Court of Appeal 
for Ontario had the chance to reconsider the exclusion of eyewitness memory experts in R v 
Frimpong.106 The defence submitted that Abbey overruled the McIntosh view of social science.107 
The appellate court disagreed.108 Similarly, in R v Jeanvenne, an Ontario trial court held that 
Abbey had not changed the law as to experts who would opine on the factors that produce false 
confessions, a form of evidence that is also difficult (if not impossible) to admit into Canadian 
courts.109  
While there does seem to be some imbalance in where Abbey’s permissive effect has 
been felt, cases like Frimpong and Jeanvenne do not hinge on the reliability of experts, but 
whether their evidence is beyond the factfinder’s ken. In other words, memory and confessions 
experts are excluded because courts believe their evidence to be common sense (i.e., about 
everyday memory processes and social pressure) and thus not “necessary” pursuant to Mohan.110 
There is, in fact, little doubt that the field of eyewitness memory research has produced a tested 
and reliable basis of knowledge.111 
Courts might be more likely to find that a psychologist’s opinion was beyond the 
factfinder’s ken if he or she could opine on the psychology of a particular witness or confessor 
rather than on the general psychological processes. However, these researchers have largely

research to the law.’ Experimental methods and findings have been tested and retested, subjected to scientific 
scrutiny through peer-reviewed journals, evaluated through the lens of meta-analyses, and replicated at times in real-
world settings.” 24 
 
stayed within the boundaries of their discipline.112 And when they have not, courts have excluded 
them.113 For example, the defence in R v Pearce tendered an expert who psychologically 
assessed the accused and opined that he was prone to false confessions (i.e., he did not simply 
describe the factors that produce false confessions).114 The Court applied Daubert to this 
(minimally tested) evidence and found it was not demonstrably scientifically valid, and thus 
should be excluded.115 
Part IV. Forensic Science, the Off-Switch, and the Science of Expertise 
  Abbey’s impact on the admission of forensic scientific evidence is possibly the most 
baffling. Courts have not taken up Justice Doherty’s suggestion of tailoring the reliability 
analysis to the nature of the opinion.116 Rather, they have engaged in various exercises in 
characterization to find that a testable forensic scientific practice is not novel or is more 
appropriately labeled experiential. Then, they have avoided any substantive reliability inquiry by 
(apparently) construing Abbey #1 as a guild test and adverting to the expert’s membership in a 
profession or field of study. Or, they simply admit the expert based on his or her qualifications 
and experiences (a “sufficient experience” test).117 In other words, courts simply hit the “off-
switch” on any substantive reliability scrutiny.118 As academics and peak scientific bodies have

113 I am not aware of a Canadian case in which an eyewitness expert has attempted to provide an individuating 
opinion. Clinical psychologists or psychiatrists periodically attempt to provide unreliable individuating opinions 
about the effects of abuse on memory and reporting of abuse: KA, supra note 32; JP v British Columbia (Children 
and Family Development), 2017 BCCA 308, [2017] 12 WWR 639.

117 Risinger, supra note 4 at 769-771. 
118 A similar trend has been occurring in the U.S., New Wigmore, supra note 4 at §10.3.2, concluding: “A number of 
opinions then simply assert that the Daubert deficiencies are not fatal because the traditional forensic identification 
testimony satisfies Kumho Tire.” 25 
 
noted, this is a dangerous practice.119 I will only briefly review this phenomenon (because it has 
been detailed elsewhere)120 and then suggest that when expertise is truly not susceptible to 
formal testing, courts may look to whether the expert obtained that expertise in a reliable 
manner. 
In a case lucidly detailed by Emma Cunliffe and Gary Edmond,121 the Court of Appeal 
for British Columbia in R v Aitken held that a “forensic gait” expert had been properly admitted 
at trial despite the fact that the trial judge did not consider the scientific validity of this highly 
contested practice.122 In short, forensic gait analysts compare footage of an unknown person 
walking to a known person and determine, based on the way they walk, if they are the same 
individual (or share gait characteristics, as was the case in Aitken).123 The Court of Appeal found 
that the trial court properly admitted the putative expert because, among other reasons, the 
expertise was specialized knowledge and so indicia of scientific validity were inapplicable.124 It 
did not apply the nine reliability factors to forensic gait analysis nor give any express 
consideration of reliability.  
  In similar manner to that in Aitken, the Crown has also relied on Abbey to tender a 
forensic practice developed by police officer Steve Horwood and his protégé Scott Ferguson to 
identify the individuals in videos who are carrying a gun and to opine on the characteristics of 
gun-carrying individuals.125 In two cases, courts have excluded the identification portion of these

opinions (for going to the ultimate issue) but allowed them to describe gun carrying indicia.126 
These range from common sense (e.g., a gun-sized bulge in the clothing) to unsupported folklore 
(keeping one’s gun-armed side away from nearby police).127 In admitting this expertise in R v 
Edwards, an Ontario trial court did no more than recount Officer Ferguson’s years in the police 
force  and the fact he had learned from Horwood and gone on to teach the method himself.128 
There was no reported discussion of whether these predictors are reliable. Further, as I will now 
address in the context of R v Awer, there was no discussion of whether the officers developed 
their purported specialized knowledge in a reliable way. In other words, based on the 
environment in which they trained and studied, could they be expected to have developed valid 
cues to identify armed individuals? 
  The opinion at issue in Awer was a DNA expert’s conclusion that a sample of DNA 
found on a swab of the accused’s penis came from a “wet” source of the complainant’s DNA.129 
This opinion called into question the defence’s theory of a secondary transfer or, in other words, 
that Awer may have touched something with the complainant’s DNA on it and then touched 
himself. The expert, Mr. Stephen Denison, mainly relied on an anecdote to support the wet 
transfer mechanism: “I have not seen a dry stain transfer that total amount of DNA”.130 The 
defence expert disagreed, saying that the science was too unsettled to determine if a transfer was 
secondary or direct based on the amount of DNA found. The trial judge, however, was not 
persuaded and appeared to place great weight on Denison’s anecdote in convicting Awer.131

  On appeal, Awer challenged the admissibility of the Crown expert’s opinion as unreliable 
anecdotal evidence. A majority of the Court of Appeal for Alberta disagreed and simply hit the 
off-switch. Daubert, according to the majority, did not apply because the expert, like Dr. Totten, 
was drawing on specialized knowledge rather than novel science:132  
The evidence of Dr. Totten, like that of Denison here, was of specialized knowledge flowing 
from personal life experience in relation to activities of gangs. For Denison it arose in the 
practical application of DNA investigations and related science. 
Despite this analogy the Court did not apply the Abbey #1 factors to Denison’s evidence or 
consider whether his previous practical applications provided him with reliable expertise.  
The defence also relied on the Supreme Court’s 2014 R v Sekhon decision.133 In Sekhon, 
the Court held as inadmissible a police officer’s opinion that in his years of work, he had never 
encountered a drug courier who did not know he or she was carrying drugs (i.e., a blind 
courier).134 The Supreme Court, quoting the dissent in the court below, said that such evidence 
was unduly prejudicial because it was endorsed by the “superficial attractiveness” of an 
expert.135 Yet, at the same time, the merely anecdotal personal observation seemed dispositive of 
the accused’s mens rea.136 The defence in Awer argued that, like the police officer’s drug courier 
opinion, Denison could not found his opinion on the bald anecdote that in all his years analysing 
DNA, he had not seen a dry source transfer as much DNA as he observed in the instant case.137 
The majority of the Alberta court again disagreed. First, the trial judge’s weighting of the 
                                                 
132 Awer ABCA, supra note 106 at para 38. Justice Berger dissented, saying that Denison’s evidence did not meet 
scientific standards, see paras 89-132.

135 Ibid at para 50.

137 Awer ABCA, supra note 1 at para 50. 28 
 
evidence deserved discretion138 and second, Sekhon was distinguishable because the anecdote in 
that case went to the ultimate issue – Sekhon’s mens rea.139 
  At the Supreme Court, Awer again argued that Denison’s evidence should not be 
admitted. The Supreme Court allowed the appeal but importantly did not hold that Denison’s 
anecdote should have been excluded. Rather, the Court held that the trial judge should have been 
more measured in the relative scrutiny applied to the Crown and defence expert.140 This 
imbalance unduly shifted the burden of proof to the accused. While this decision itself is not very 
informative about the meaning of Abbey and Sekhon going forward, a review of oral arguments 
may provide insight into the Supreme Court’s current thinking on expert evidence. Note, 
however, that these comments are not in any way binding and may have been posed rhetorically 
as part of the discussion with counsel. 
  First, Justice Rowe suggested that there are circumstances in which experience-based 
expertise is valuable. In doing so, he drew a contrast between experimental science and the 
experience of a sea pilot.141 His description of the sea pilot’s experience is worth quoting in 
full:142 
The testimony of a master mariner concerning the handling of a vessel in a particular sea state 
or in a particular situation in a port. You cannot have a controlled study there. You’re not 
going to smash vessels into a dock and do a statistical analysis of it.

scientific method and others simply do not. Chemical analysis does.” 
142 Ibid. 29 
 
But if you have a mariner who has basically spent their whole life on the water and says look, I 
docked vessels thousands of times and I know what happens and the limits in which you can 
control it. That to me, in the right circumstances, is proper expert evidence […] the publication 
of studies, the reference to peer reviewed literature, the strict application of the scientific 
method it seems to me is not a prerequisite for expert opinion in all instances. 
  Here, Justice Rowe appears to be relating the “harbor pilot” analogy from United States v 
Starzecpyzel.143 An important point, unfortunately not explored in oral arguments, was that the 
harbor pilot example is distinguishable from much of the expert evidence that passes the Abbey 
test (including that in Awer, Woodcock, Edwards, and much of the police expertise discussed in 
Part V). The harbour pilot receives immediate and accurate feedback about his performance each 
time he docks. The mere fact that he has not crashed provides objective evidence of his 
proficiency. Denison, however, is unlikely to receive such unambiguous feedback from his DNA 
tests. In many cases, he may never learn if the source of a sample is dry or wet, and – in fact – 
may be less likely to learn the source of dry secondary transfers because those occur in cases in 
which the complainant’s account is difficult to corroborate.144 
Justice Moldaver, who authored the Sekhon decision, picked up on the harbour pilot 
example and related it to Sekhon. First, Justice Moldaver expressed that lower courts had read 
the holding (as against anecdotal evidence) too broadly.145 Instead, he indicated that Sekhon 
                                                 
143 (1995) 880 F Supp 1027 at 1029. For a review, see D Michael Risinger & Michael J Saks, “Science and 
Nonscience in the Courts: Daubert Meets Handwriting Identification Expertise” (1996) 82 Iowa L Rev 21 at 33-34. 
144 For example, wet source transfers may occur in more straightforward cases in which other evidence eventually 
corroborates the mode of transfer. Dry transfers may occur in cases in which it is difficult to directly implicate an 
assailant. Therefore, dry transfers may actually transfer more DNA than Denison thinks, but he never received the 
feedback to know this. 
145 Awer Webcast, supra note 141: “There is no legitimate inference that can be drawn from the fact that every 
murder that I have investigated – and if you look at the examples we used in Sekhon they are all related to mental 
state, every one of them and to the extent that’s not been considered, it really should be – because you cannot 
possibly say that because in every murder I have investigated, the accused was found to have the requisite intent for 
murder, therefore this accused had the requisite intent for murder in the context of we’ll say a domestic assault or 30 
 
should be read narrowly, applying specifically to anecdotes going to the accused’s mental state. 
In particular, he said that the harbour pilot is a “whole different matter” than “what’s in 
somebody’s mind based on every time you have arrested someone for murder”.146  
  Going forward – and assuming these comments made during legal arguments are 
representative of the Supreme Court’s thinking – there may be a sizable contested area between 
potentially admissible harbour pilot-type situations (i.e., specialized knowledge from 
circumstances when the tendered expert receives immediate and unambiguous feedback about 
his or her performance) and clearly inadmissible Sekhon-type situations, in which the expert 
never learns what was in the mind of the accused. Where courts draw the line between 
permissible and impermissible expertise will be important and, in my view, should be informed 
by the science of expertise.147  
Several insights from cognitive scientific research on expertise merit a brief review. First, 
while the amount of experience is a factor,148 it is often a misleading factor because of the 
importance of the learning environment.149 As reflected in the harbour pilot example, timely and 
objective feedback is a key aspect of a learning environment because it allows the individual to 
connect some relevant cue (e.g., the speed of the harbor pilot’s vessel) to the ultimate conclusion 
                                                 
something.” [emphasis added]. In the Awer Supreme Court judgment, Justice Moldaver similarly noted “qualitative" 
distinction between Awer and Sekhon. See Awer SCC, supra note 1 at para 2.

(e.g., whether that was a safe speed at which to dock). In this respect, Daniel Kahneman and 
Gary Klein give the counterexample of “technical”150 stock analysts who have no non-public 
information about a company, but instead deceive themselves into thinking they have actual 
expertise based on industry folklore about patterns of price changes (e.g., arbitrary “resistance 
levels” that drive stock prices – these are what psychologists call illusory correlations).151 
Further, expertise is typically not fractionated – it does not carry over to tasks that may 
seem closely related. For example, weather forecasters are proficient at predicting routine 
weather, but are much poorer at predicting more aberrant events like hail.152 Given these 
findings, job status and general professional progression (i.e., forms of social recognition) are 
often poor indicators of domain specific forms of expertise.153 Moreover, a particular danger 
arises when professionals “who know how to use their knowledge for some purposes, attempt to 
use the same knowledge for other purposes.”154 This can result in the highly prejudicial “illusion 
of validity” whereby the expert gives a confident opinion about something he or she is not 
actually skilled in.155 
  These findings from the study of expertise should inform the admission of experience-
based expertise. For instance, courts should be less concerned with the number of years a

novel research on companies and industries.

dollar business of baseball decisions. Executives long relied on largely invalid indicia (e.g., the player’s 
attractiveness) and only recently began relying on predictive statistical measures. See also Paul Slovic,

purported expert has held some job adjacent to the expertise156 and more concerned with the way 
in which he or she developed the expertise. In this way, Justices Rowe and Moldaver were 
correct in suggesting the “anecdote” characterization is itself not very useful. For instance, it may 
have been that the concealed gun experts had viewed hundreds of videos in which they 
ultimately learned if individuals were indeed carrying guns. Or, more dangerously, they may 
have simply been repeating unvalidated heuristics passed down through the years as a way to 
rationalize unconscious reliance on other cues, like the race of the suspect. Importantly, as I will 
discuss in Part V, questions probing actual expertise are not asked enough of the time.    
Part V. Police Expertise and a (Possible) New Role for Transparency 
An examination of police expertise post-Abbey demonstrates many of the themes detailed 
so far. First, courts rarely engage in any substantive reliability analysis, instead simply reciting 
the officer’s qualifications and experiences (i.e., sufficient experience) or standards of the police 
guild. And following from the above discussion of the science of expertise, courts rarely attempt 
to connect the officer’s experiences to their ability to reliably produce the opinions they are 
tendered for. However, when an expert purports to possess some gang-related knowledge, courts 
do sometimes engage with the Abbey reliability factors. This may simply be due to the 
superficial similarity of the expertise (i.e., Totten was a gang expert). Those courts have found 
the transparency-related factors particularly useful, a trend I will pick up on in in Part VI in my 
description of a transparent proficiency-based approach. 
                                                 
156 For examples of this problematic approach, see: R v M(C), 2010 ONSC 4819 at para 13, 90 WCB (2d) 192; R v 
Pham, 2013 ONSC 4903 at para 32, 300 CCC (3d) 111 [Pham]; R v Reid, 2017 ONSC 4082 at paras 29-30, 140 
WCB (2d) 649 [Reid].  33 
 
With an increasing amount of police expertise proffered by the Crown, determining the 
reliability of that expertise is of special importance.157 The Crown frequently calls on police 
officers to provide inculpatory opinions about drug and gang related charges. With drugs, the 
opinion often supports a charge of possession for the purpose of trafficking.158 For example, the 
officer may describe the typical tactics of traffickers, the amount of the drug they carry and sell, 
and the equipment they use.159 The officer may also be proffered to describe the consumption 
patterns of drug users to counter the defence’s suggestion that the accused merely possessed the 
drug for personal use.160 Sometimes, the officer would go as far as to definitively state that the 
accused possessed the drug to traffic it (or give that opinion on a hypothetical set of facts 
identical to the Crown’s case).161 As to gangs, police also provide several inculpatory opinions: 
indicia of gang membership,162 whether an individual is in a gang,163 and the meaning of gang 
slang or coded language.164

  Following from the discussion of experiential expertise above, it is possible to develop 
guidelines for how difficult-to-test police expertise should and should not be scrutinized for 
reliability. On the less reliable end of the spectrum is a general reference to time spent as a police 
officer and the experiences that follow from that (e.g., conversations with informants, internal 
coursework). Such analysis provides meagre assurance that the officer can reliably perform tasks 
like identifying drug traffickers (or the characteristics of them). 
Rather, courts should inquire into how experience translates into reliable proficiency in 
the specific judgment the expert is making. For instance, undercover officers will learn quickly if 
slang means what he or she thinks it means and if a drug purchase of a certain size is customary. 
This is because if the officer was mistaken, he or she would unequivocally find out. Other roles 
in investigations in which the officer regularly receives feedback can also be expected to produce 
expertise. Officers may, for instance, consistently learn if other evidence corroborated the 
suspicion that a suspect was involved in trafficking. On the other hand, mere conversations with 
arrestees and informants about their drug use carry no guarantees of reliability. The officer may 
also be siloed into a particular role and thus rarely learn about the outcome of investigations. 
Finally, as demonstrated by the expert in Abbey, results of interviews and investigations may be 
misremembered or otherwise distorted. Therefore, transparency should be demanded, even of 
police experts relying on their experiences.  
Police Drug Expertise 
  This subsection details Abbey’s lack of impact in cases considering the admissibility of 
police drug experts.165 Rather, the Supreme Court’s decision in R v Sekhon – a trafficking case  – 
                                                 
165 Prior to Abbey, there was no consistent approach to the reliability of police experts. For instance, the Court of 
Appeal for Alberta did not consider reliability when reversing a trial decision that had excluded a police officer 35 
 
and its exclusion of a police officer who provided anecdotal evidence about drug traffickers 
seems to have had more of an effect. Courts subsequently scrutinized such anecdotal evidence 
more closely. This may have led to a practice whereby the police undertook more systematic 
surveys and interviews of drug users and traffickers. As Abbey and Gager demonstrated, 
however, this practice carries its own dangers, even when the expert is a trained social scientist.   
After Abbey, courts continued to sidestep reliability analysis by characterizing the 
expertise as non-scientific and then broadly adverting to the officer’s years of experience.166 One 
Ontario trial court at least cited Abbey’s reliability analysis but, puzzlingly, did not apply it to the 
facts and instead focused on general police experience.167 Another Ontario decision developed 
11 factors for use in assessing police experts’ qualifications.168 These factors generally focus on 
experience and training in the form of coursework and membership in organizations, without any 
express consideration of reliability.169 Such decisions sharply contrast with the one decision I am 
aware of to have expressly applied Abbey’s reliability analysis. In that case, R v Sriskanda, the 
court noted that the Abbey factors were an imperfect fit with the officer’s purported specialized 
                                                 
because he was not demonstrably more experienced than an average police officer. Instead, the Court simply 
examined the officer’s experience as a police officer relative to what a factfinder might know. The officer opined on, 
among other things, drug consumption patterns, packaging for distribution, and pricing. ON, supra note 34 at paras 
12, 14, 24. Similarly, a British Columbia court characterized drug consumption knowledge as not novel science and 
resultingly evaded the question of reliability altogether. R v Petavel, 2006 BCSC 1931 at para 14, 72 WCB (2d) 35. 
These decisions are difficult to reconcile with contemporaneous decisions that demanded more structured and 
scientific experience. See R v Klassen, 2003 MBQB 253 at para 26, 179 Man R (2d) 115 [Klassen]; R v Jerrett, 242 
Nfld & PEIR 348 at para 28, 719 APR 348 demanding the evidence pass Daubert. Post-White Burgess, police 
officers who are involved in the investigation or have significant experience with the accused may be excluded for

169 The court eventually found the police officer had “sufficient expertise” based on general advertence to his 
interactions with “literally hundreds” of potential drug users in vehicle stops and “numerous” drug users without 
considering how these may have produced reliable expertise. Ibid at paras 32-81. Several other post-Abbey decisions 
gave little or no attention to reliability, see: R v Lee, 2014 ONCJ 640, 117 WCB (2d) 598 [Lee]; R v Tremblett, 2012

knowledge.170 Still, there were no quality assurance measures (factor 2) and information passed 
to the officer through others was not reliably stored and available (factor 3).171 As a result, this 
officer’s opinion on the risks associated with consuming and producing a marijuana by-product 
were inadmissible.172 
  Perhaps because it was a drug trafficking case itself, the Supreme Court’s decision in R v 
Sekhon seems to have been more influential than Abbey in cases of drug expertise.173 Across 
several decisions it appears to have at least nudged courts to consider whether a police officer’s 
years of anecdotal observations could scaffold his or her expertise.174 This issue is especially 
likely to arise when the expert would opine on drug addiction and casual use (as opposed to 
trafficking) because most officers obtain their knowledge about these areas from unstructured 
interviews and conversations with confidential informants and individuals arrested for other 
reasons. Following Sekhon, courts began to exclude such evidence, under the theory that 
anecdotally-derived specialized knowledge requires additional scrutiny.175  
These worries about anecdotal drug use evidence may have inspired the Crown in R v 
Reid to tender a police officer who purported to have performed a more systematic study of drug 
users.176 He opined on the behaviours of drug traffickers and users. This officer, Detective 
Constable Charlie Rau, questioned 40 marijuana users about their use.177 His participants

consisted of arrestees, those identified when executing search warrants, and confidential 
informants.178 
In assessing the reliability of Rau’s opinion, the Court expressly declined to follow 
guidance from Daubert179 and the Goudge Report.180 As to the Goudge Report, the trial judge 
easily dismissed it: “The Goudge Inquiry dealt with the evidence of a disgraced forensic 
pathologist. I am dealing with a police officer.” This view ignores the vast literature the Goudge 
Report inspired and reflected, finding systemic uncertainties in expert evidence.181 Instead, the 
Court characterized Rau’s evidence as specialized knowledge pursuant to Abbey.182 Despite the 
clear similarity between Rau’s and Totten’s interview methods, the Court did not apply the 
Abbey factors.  
  Instead of relying on the Abbey factors, the trial judge found sufficient expertise in Rau’s 
years of experience as a police officer who attends courses and converses with “fellow officers, 
arrested persons, confidential informants, found-ins, and others.”183 The difficulty in the Court’s 
approach towards Rau’s interviews is viscerally illustrated by Mark Totten’s evidence in Abbey 
and Gager. As discussed, Totten exploited shifting inclusion criteria and definitions of key terms 
(e.g., gang member) to support the opinion he was hired to give. To qualify a police officer with

ostensibly less training in social science who labours under the same (or worse) adversarial bias 
seems dangerously imprudent.184  
Police Gang Expertise 
  While Abbey’s influence on the admission of drug expertise has been notably limited, the 
decisions in the gang context have at times taken on a different tenor.185 This may be due to the 
simple fact that Totten’s gang expertise in Abbey is factually similar to the expertise of police 
gang experts who also purport to understand gang culture. In any event, the gang cases are useful 
in showing what occurs when courts begin demanding demonstrable reliability from police 
officers. In short, they find that these opinions are seriously flawed.  
  In 2016, the British Columbia Supreme Court in R v Giles was much more critical of a 
police expert who based his opinion on his “omnibus” experience and training,186 without 
demonstrating the reliability of that knowledge.187 For instance, after a lengthy comparison to 
Totten’s opinion in Abbey #1, the Court in Giles found that the expert’s failure to retain his notes 
was problematic, leading to the possibility that his opinion was not representative of his actual 
expertise.188 Somewhat ironically in light of Abbey #2, the Court held up Totten’s evidence as a 
model of transparency and diligence: “an important aspect […] in relation to Dr. Totten’s work 
in Abbey 2009 was that the information upon which the opinion was based had been ‘accurately 
                                                 
184 Both Totten and Rau’s methodologies were not purely qualitative because they drew force from the number of 
interviews peformed  
185 The following decisions applied the factors in Abbey #1 or compared an expert witness to Totten: R v Myles

recorded and memorialized’.”189 Moreover, the expert in Giles relied on literature that seemed 
unsystematically chosen, except for the fact that it supported his opinion.190  
  Giles bears many similarities to the Ontario Superior Court of Justice’s recent decision in 
R v O(F).191 In OF, the Court excluded the Crown’s police gang expert, who would have opined 
on the characteristics and customs of Toronto street gangs, for many reasons related to the 
reliability of his expertise. Notably, while the officer had debriefed many alleged gang members, 
these debriefings were not produced for the defence.192 And again, in this pre-Abbey #2 decision, 
the Court drew a somewhat portentous parallel to Totten’s work:193  
… the officer did not give any evidence that he had employed any techniques or methods to 
ensure, to the degree possible, the veracity of the information that he received through these 
debriefs. I contrast this absence of validation with the evidence that was given regarding the 
techniques and methods employed by Dr. Totten in Abbey to ensure that the methodology that 
he followed was valid… 
The officer had also not done any undercover work, attended conferences, or reviewed the 
academic literature on gangs.194  
  All of this is not to say that Abbey has been widely effective in encouraging trial judges 
to seek reliable gang expertise. For instance, and somewhat puzzlingly, the Abbey remand judge 
did not apply a reliability analysis to a police officer’s opinion that Abbey was a gang

member.195 Further, the trial judge in Gager who was deeply critical of the reliability of Totten’s 
research did not apply the same scrutiny to a police officer who gave substantively the same 
evidence.196 It appears both judges expected more out of the sociology guild than they did the 
police guild. However, some objective level of reliability ought to be demanded and provided 
when an authority provides such powerful inculpatory opinion evidence in a criminal trial.197 
Part VI. Towards a Transparent Proficiency Approach 
The Royal Society's motto 'Nullius in verba' is taken to mean 'take nobody's word for it'.198 
  Despite its promise, Abbey #1 seems to not have had effect that commentators hoped 
for.199 In other words, it has not served as adaptive approach to a panoply of expertise (i.e., one 
tailored to the “nature of the opinion”).200 Rather, the specialized knowledge characterization is 
an off-switch for any substantive evaluation of the reliability of experts. In some cases, Abbey 
                                                 
195 Rather, that decision was excluded because it went to the ultimate issue and would have forced a cross-
examination on inadmissible hearsay. The expert’s opinion on the meaning of Abbey’s tattoo was excluded for its 
basis in anecdote. See R v Abbey, 2011 ONSC 1260 at paras 41-49, 82 CR (6th) 385. 
196 For instance, Justice Clark noted that police expertise should not be held to too high a standard because it is 
predominantly experiential and typically not based on systematic research. On the factors that proved nearly fatal to 
Totten’s admissibility – whether the underlying data was recorded and open to scrutiny –  Justice Clark seemed less 
concerned with the fact that the police officer’s (Detective Backus) interviews with confidential informants were 
privileged and thus not available to the defence. Similarly, when considering whether Backus honoured the 
boundaries of his discipline, Justice Clark was not particularly concerned that Backus refused to resile from opinions 
even when “objectively viewed, their foundations appear to be weak.” See Gager Police, supra note 163 at paras 
167-183, 193. The same stubbornness on the part of Totten drew much more criticism. See Gager Totten, supra note 
35 at para 42. Justice Clark ultimately allowed Backus to opine on the identity of the gangs that appeared to be 
involved in case, but not conclude as to whether the co-accused were members of that gang. See Gager Police, 
supra note 163 at paras 215-266. 
197 Beyond Abbey and Gager, several other forms of police gang expertise continue to evade the gatekeeper with 
little or no reliability analysis. For instance, the Nova Scotia Supreme Court qualified a police officer as an expert on 
motorcycle gangs over the defence’s protestations that he did not have “reliable ‘specialized knowledge’”. The 
Court justified its decision merely on the basis of the officer’s long experience without delving into whether that 
experience had a reliable basis. See R v Howe, 2017 NSSC 213 at paras 30-31, 140 WCB (2d) 648. See also R v 
Sappleton, 2010 ONSC 5704, 91 WCB (2d) 699; R v Valentine [2009], 87 WCB (2d) 518, 2009 CarswellOnt 8872 
(Ont SCJ); R v Ali, 2011 BCSC 1850, 103 WCB (2d) 68; R v Nurse, 2014 ONSC 2409, 117 WCB (2d) 378; R v 
Patterson, 2015 ONSC 660, 120 WCB (2d) 42; AT, supra note 164. But note that some consideration of reliability 
may be tacit in a court’s analysis, see R v Farah, 2016 ONSC 2874 at paras 33, 41, 129 WCB (2d) 577.

has allowed for the uncritical admission of untested (yet testable) evidence. In other cases, the 
say-so of the expert has been replaced by the say-so of the group. The most deferential parts of 
the judgment have – too often – ruled the day.  
  Ultimately, it may be that Supreme Court guidance is needed for courts to take 
specialized knowledge more seriously – in both providing assistance in how to scrutinize 
specialized knowledge and in rethinking the unhelpful dichotomy between novel or contested 
science, and specialized knowledge.201 But, in the interest of adding to the judicial toolkit and in 
service of a more flexible approach, I offer suggestions based on the transparent proficiency of 
experts. As I noted above, this suggestion is informed by both the failures and successes of 
Abbey. Moreover, transparency builds off of the text of Abbey #1 itself, which includes an 
inquiry into the storage, recording and availability of the underlying data (although, I will 
suggest broader transparency, including the parameters of the expert’s analysis). Transparent 
proficiency can also be applied in a manner that is sensitive to the expert’s opinion and thus is 
not reliant on blunt distinctions between novel science and specialized knowledge. 
Transparency responds to the fact that mere reference to conversations, interviews and 
various other experiences the witness has engaged in may be unreliable and misleading. Even 
scientists working under ostensibly stricter safeguards have frequently fooled themselves and 
their peers by exploiting undisclosed flexibility in their data and analysis. Brian Nosek, Jeffrey 
Spies and Matt Motyl cogently describe how these biases operate in science:202

Promote Truth Over Publishability” (2012) 7:6 Perspectives on Psychological Science 615 at 617. 42 
 
we might remember the gist of what the study was and what we found. Forgetting the details 
provides an opportunity for reimagining the study purpose and results to recall and understand 
them in their best (i.e., most publishable) light.  
There is no reason to think the same is not true among expert witnesses. 
  The primary meta-scientific reform flowing from Nosek and colleagues’ work is 
enhanced transparency. For example, the journal Science now requires that authors make their 
data and methods publicly available.203 And, as mentioned above, pre-registration is becoming 
increasingly common.204 While it is certainly important that scientists build a reliable body of 
knowledge, science can self-correct in most cases. Such opportunities (e.g., appeals or fresh 
evidence) are much more limited in law – it does not seem like so much of a stretch to suggest 
that experts providing powerful inculpatory opinions should be held to a standard of 
transparency. Indeed, as I described above, there is some precedent now that a failure to disclose 
the foundations of an opinion (for instance, based on confidential informant privilege) can impair 
the probative force of that opinion so greatly that it is inadmissible.205  
  Along with transparency, courts should determine if the witness has proficiency in the 
precise task at hand (i.e., to reliably provide the conclusion they are seeking to provide). This 
requires more than “omnibus”206 experience as a member of a guild. For instance, it is not 
enough that a witness has decades of experience as a forensic scientist. If the question is 
determining whether a DNA sample came from a wet source based on the amount of DNA

present, then the witness must be able to reliably do that (or, as we will see, provide convincing 
indirect evidence that he or she can do that).207 
  The concept of proficiency is an important and growing area of study among 
academics.208 Formal proficiency testing (e.g., a fingerprint examiner’s accuracy in identifying 
fingerprints in realistic circumstances according to a validated test) was also recently prescribed 
by a report of the U.S. President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (the 
“PCAST”) on forensic science.209 Surprisingly, however, courts do not seem to require that 
experts establish their proficiency, even in fields where tests are routinely performed and when 
the expert’s practices are described as scientific.210 On the other hand, cogent academic work 
suggests that examiners in several forensic sciences should not be permitted – as they are – to 
describe their processes as objective and scientific – that is misleading.211 Rather, they should 
simply provide results of their proficiency tests. Analogously, years of largely unrelated police 
and forensic experience and accreditations may only mislead the trier of fact, who should be 
focused on the expert’s proficiency at the task at hand.  
                                                 
207 Further, Helena Likwornik, supra note 22, suggests that defining the task at hand can also provide courts with 
analytic clarity. In the context of the Awer trial, she suggests that the relevant issue was if the DNA transfer was 
direct or from a secondary source. If the Court had established this as the scope of the evidence, then it would have 
been even clearer that Denison’s opinion lacked probative value.

Abbey #1 may have helped the Canadian case law down a path towards proficiency at the 
task at hand by encouraging trial judges to define that at an early stage. This exercise promotes 
analytic clarity and sets up an inquiry into what exactly the expert must demonstrate proficiency 
in.212 Recall that Justice Doherty held that the (first) trial judge in Abbey should have established 
the permissible scope of Totten’s evidence as the three general meanings of teardrop tattoos (and 
not a case-specific judgment of Abbey’s tattoo).213 Several decisions have followed Abbey to 
exclude conclusory opinions about the accused (but note several have not followed this rule).214 
Courts typically justify these decisions by referring to the old ultimate issue rule, saying that 
while that rule is no longer in general effect, opinions going to the ultimate issue are especially 
prejudicial.215 
I suggest that a more useful and parsimonious justification for excluding these conclusory 
opinions is that they are judgments about which the expert cannot be expected to be reliably 
proficient. For example, while the expert may be proficient in the pre-scoped expertise (e.g., 
globally, as a police officer or forensic scientist), the expert has not established that he or she can 
reliably identify drug traffickers or armed individuals in CCTV footage. Moreover, it seems 
illogical to admit unreliable evidence simply because of its distance from the ultimate issue.216 
                                                 
212 Likwornik Awer, supra note 22. 
213 Abbey ONCA 2009, supra note 1 at paras 62-70. That framework evidence was still assailable for a lack of 
transparency, as the courts in Gager and Abbey #2 eventually decided. 
214 See Lucas, supra note 164 at para 9. Note, however, that several courts have chosen to not exclude the 
individuating portion of the expert’s opinion: R v Tulloch, 2016 ONSC 3667, 131 WCB (2d) 37; R v Robertson, 
2017 BCSC 1451, 141 WCB (2d) 621; Lee, supra note 169; Murphy, supra note 167; Dominic, supra note 161. 
215 Awer ABCA, supra note 1 at para 59. 
216 See for instance Robertson, supra note 214. In that case, the police expert opined that the location of the crime 
was a place of drug trafficking (an individuating opinion). However, there were no drug trafficking charges. Rather, 
the Crown relied on the drug trafficking evidence to suggest the accused must have known he was receiving stolen 
goods. Despite this evidence not going to the ultimate issue, the court excluded the individuating portion of the 
evidence. While the court did not justify the exclusion on these grounds, I suggest a good reason for exclusion in 
Robertson is that the expert was not demonstrably (or impliedly) proficient in determining if specific locations are 
places of drug trafficking. 45 
 
This invites (counterproductive) dispute about how far evidence needs to be from the ultimate 
issue. In Awer, for instance, the Court of Appeal held that the opinion on the source of the DNA 
should have been admitted because it was not about the ultimate issue.217 The Supreme Court, 
however, delved deeper into the case and noted the opinion was essential to the trial judge’s 
decision.218 The question of ultimate issue, in this case, was little more than a distraction – the 
evidence was baseless and should have been excluded. 
The proper manner of demonstrating proficiency at the task at hand (the onus of which 
lies on the party tendering the evidence) will depend on the nature of the expertise. For instance, 
forensic identification can typically be subjected to formal proficiency tests that are as 
challenging as the instant case. If a forensic gait analyst purports to be able to reliably identify 
individuals (or reliably compare gait characteristics) based on their gait in videos of similar 
quality to the case, then that expert should be able to demonstrate that in a proficiency test. 
Pursuant to the transparency requirement, the conditions of these tests (e.g., the quality of the 
video) should be disclosed. For judgments that cannot be formally tested, valid indicia of 
proficiency may substitute in some cases. For instance, when a witness has amassed experience 
in circumstances in which the feedback is immediate and unambiguous (as with the harbour 
pilot), the trial judge may properly infer proficiency.   
  Perhaps most critically, transparent proficiency helps remedy an information asymmetry 
that has been at the root of many miscarriages of justice.219 Experts, cloaked in the garb of 
authority, will almost always know more about the subject matter of their opinion than both the 
judge and jury. This presents the risk that both will uncritically accept the expert’s opinion.

Indeed, as Justice Doherty noted in Abbey #1, “the most important risk is the danger that a jury 
will be unable to make an effective and critical assessment of the evidence.”220 But by laying 
bare the foundations of the opinion and the expert’s ability to provide any judgments related to 
that foundation, the factfinder stands a much better chance.
