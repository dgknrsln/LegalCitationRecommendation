THE MANY REVOLUTIONS OF CARPENTER

forthcoming 32 HARV. J.L. & TECH ___ (2019) 
 
 
Carpenter v. United States, the 2018 Supreme Court opinion that 
requires  the  police  to  obtain  a  warrant  to  access  an  individual’s 
historical whereabouts from the records of a cell phone provider, is the 
most important Fourth Amendment opinion in decades. Although many 
have  acknowledged  some  of  the  ways  the  opinion  has  changed  the 
doctrine of Constitutional privacy, the importance of Carpenter has not 
yet been fully appreciated. Carpenter works many revolutions in the 
law,  not  only  through  its  holding  and  new  rule,  but  in  more 
fundamental respects. The opinion reinvents the reasonable expectation 
of privacy test as it applies to large databases of information about 
individuals.  It  turns  the  third-party  doctrine  inside  out,  requiring 
judges to scrutinize the products of purely private decisions. In dicta, it 
announces a new rule of technological equivalence, which might end up 
covering more police activity than the core rule. Finally, it embraces 
technological exceptionalism as a centerpiece for the interpretation of 
the Fourth Amendment, rejecting backwards-looking interdisciplinary 
methods  such  as  legal  history  or  surveys  of  popular  attitudes. 
Considering all of these revolutions, Carpenter is the most important 
Fourth Amendment decision since Katz v. United States, a case it might 
end up rivaling in influence.

INTRODUCTION 
 
The Supreme Court’s opinion in Carpenter v. United States2 has 
been heralded by many as a milestone for the protection of privacy in 
an  age  of  rapidly  changing  technology.3  Despite  this,  scholars  and

[hereinafter Strahilevitz, Ten Thoughts]; Orin Kerr, First Thoughts on Carpenter v. 
  2 commentators have failed to appreciate many of the important aspects 
of this landmark opinion. Carpenter works a series of revolutions in 
Fourth  Amendment  law,  which  are  likely  to  guide  the  evolution  of 
Constitutional privacy in this country for a generation or more. 
The most obvious revolution is the case’s basic holding—for the 
first time, the Court has held that the police must secure a warrant to 
require a business to divulge information about its customers compiled 
for the business’s purposes, reinventing the reasonable expectation of 
privacy test and significantly narrowing what is known as the third-
party doctrine.4 Information about the location of cell phone customers 
held  by  cell  phone  providers  is  now  protected  by  the  Fourth 
Amendment, at least when the police seek seven days or more of such 
information.5 This cell-site location information (CSLI) has become a 
key source of evidence for the investigation of crimes, so this holding 
will  revolutionize  the  way  the  police  build  their  cases,  requiring  a 
warrant where none has been required before.6 
Building outward, the reasoning of the majority opinion, written 
by Chief Justice Roberts and commanding five votes, revolutionizes the 
law of police access to many other types of information, in addition to 
CSLI.7 Databases that can be used, directly or indirectly, to ascertain 
the precise location of individuals over time are likely now covered by 
the Fourth Amendment. The police will probably need a warrant to 
obtain location information collected by mobile apps, fitness trackers, 
connected cars, and many so-called “quantified self” technologies.8 
The  reasoning  extends  beyond  location  information,  although 
predicting the scope and shape of this revolutionary step requires a bit 
more  speculation.  The  majority  opinion  promulgates  a  new,  multi-
factor test that will likely cover other commercially significant data 
that  the  police  has  begun  to  access  in  its  investigations.9  Massive 
databases of web browsing habits stored by internet service providers 
(ISPs) will probably now require a warrant to access.10 Perhaps most

  3 surprisingly,  the  majority’s  reasoning  will  apply  even  to  massive 
databases of telephone dialing and banking records, cutting back on 
the holdings of two cases, Smith v. Maryland11 and Miller v. United 
States,12  that  the  Carpenter  Court  expressly  declined  to  overrule.13 
Those  two  cases  are  in  a  much  more  precarious  state  than  other 
commenters have recognized.14 
Looking beyond the central holding and reasoning, to dicta from 
the  majority  and  dissenting  opinions,  another  class  of  revolutions 
comes into view. The Court has breathed new life into Kyllo v. United 
States, the 2001 case that required the police to obtain a warrant to 
aim  a  thermal  imaging  device  at  a  private  home.15  At  least  seven 
justices of the Carpenter Court suggest a heretofore unrecognized rule 
building on Kyllo: the rule of technological equivalence. If a technology, 
or  a  near-future  improvement,  gives  the  police  a  power  to  gather 
information that is the “modern-day equivalent” of activity that has 
been  held  to  be  a  Fourth  Amendment  search,  the  use  of  that 
technology  is  also  a  search.16  This  is  a  far  simpler  and  more 
straightforward  test  to  apply  than  the  multi-factor  core  test  of 
Carpenter, and for that reason, could end up becoming the Carpenter 
rule cited most often as the basis for requiring the police to get a 
warrant. 
The  rule  of  technological  equivalence,  although  dicta,  finds 
expression in at least three forms in these opinions. The first is the 
rule  of  equivalence  to  the  home.  Kyllo  remains  the  best  example, 
building on Justice Scalia’s conclusion that, “in the home, our cases 
show, all details are intimate details .  . . .”17 After Carpenter, this rule 
will likely cover many consumer products sold under the banner of the 
Internet of Things.18 It will also likely cover the information gathered

doorbells, security systems, light bulbs, speakers (like Amazon’s Echo), 
refrigerators,  and  televisions.19  Many  “connected  city”  technologies, 
such  as  smart  grid  devices  similarly  gather  information  about  the 
interior of homes and would be covered as well.20  
The  second  rule  of  technological  equivalence  is  the  rule  of 
equivalence to bailment. Both Justices Kennedy and Gorsuch suggest 
that any information stored with a 21st century digital bailor—such as 
a cloud storage provider like Dropbox—is protected by a reasonable 
expectation of privacy.21  
The third rule is the rule of communications equivalence. Any 
communications technology equivalent to postal mail or the telephone 
is  covered  by  the  Fourth  Amendment.22  Most  importantly,  all  nine 
justices sign on to opinions in Carpenter that suggest that the police 
are  not  allowed  to  access  the  content  of  email  messages  without  a 
warrant, something the Court has never before held.23 It is likely that 
this  reasoning  will  cover  other  communications  technologies  in 
addition  to  email,  such  as  instant  messaging,  text  messaging,  and 
person-to-person  communications  features  of  social  networking 
services.24 
  The  last  revolution  is  a  revolution  of  legal  reasoning.  In  his 
opinion, the Chief Justice evinces, as he did in the majority opinion in 
Riley v. California,25 a profound technology exceptionalism.26 Recent 
advances in information technology are different in kind not merely in 
degree from what has come before. This idea finds substantial support 
in two decades of legal scholarship about threats from technology to 
information  privacy,  work  that  has  never  before  received  such  a 
profound endorsement from the Supreme Court.

  5 In embracing tech exceptionalism, the Court expressly declined 
invitations from scholars and amici to base its Fourth Amendment 
reasoning  in  traditional  disciplines  such  as  history  or  economics.27 
Scholars coming from those interdisciplinary traditions have expressed 
disappointment about this choice, which is an understandable reaction 
to having been heard and rejected.28  
Carpenter  is  an  inflection  point  in  the  history  of  the  Fourth 
Amendment. From now on, we’ll be talking about what the Fourth 
Amendment means in pre-Carpenter and post-Carpenter terms. It will 
be seen as being as important as Olmstead29 and Katz30 in the overall 
arc of technological privacy. 
  This article proceeds in four parts. Part I lays out the basic rule 
of Carpenter, which protects large databases full of information from 
unreasonable police access according to a new, multi-factor test, and 
applies  the  test  to  other  private  databases  of  information.  Part  II 
explains how Carpenter has turned the government action rule of the 
Fourth  Amendment  on  its  head  and  created  three  new  rules  of 
technological  equivalence.  Part  III  discusses  the  technology 
exceptionalism at the heart of Carpenter and how it changes Fourth 
Amendment reasoning. Finally, Part IV argues that Carpenter might 
replace rather than merely apply Katz and the reasonable expectation 
of privacy test, at least for cases involving complex modern technology. 
I.  THE BASIC RULE OF CARPENTER 
Carpenter  holds  that  the  government  collection  of  cell-site 
location information (CSLI) is a search by introducing a new, multi-
factor test.31 This test serves the dual purpose of deciding whether 
access to large databases full of personal information about individuals 
constitutes a search under the Fourth Amendment and whether the 
third-party doctrine should extend to such access.32 
The Court does not exhaustively specify or defend the new test, 
although a close reading of the opinion reveals the critical factors and 
why they matter. The importance of these factors finds great support 
in recent legal scholarship. When lower courts apply these factors, they 
                                            
27 Infra Part III.F. 
28 Id. 
29 Olmstead v. United States, 277 U.S. 438 (1928) (holding that a wiretap is not a 
search, embracing the trespass theory of the Fourth Amendment). 
30 Katz v. United States, 389 U.S. 347, 351 (1967) (holding that placing a recording 
device on the exterior of a telephone booth is a search). 
31 Carpenter v. United States, 138 S. Ct. 2206, 2223 (“In light of the deeply revealing 
nature of CSLI, its depth, breadth, and comprehensive reach, and the inescapable 
and automatic nature of its collection, the fact that such information is gathered by a 
third party does not make it any less deserving of Fourth Amendment protection.”). 
32 Id. 
  6 are likely to extend the Fourth Amendment to cover many important 
commercial databases that have never before required a warrant for 
the police to access. 
A.  Carpenter’s Broad New Rule33 
Carpenter holds that the police may not collect historical CSLI 
from a cellphone provider without a warrant.34 Footnote three restricts 
the holding, for now, to seven days of collection.35 
This  is  the  opinion  most  privacy  law  scholars  and  privacy 
advocates have been awaiting for decades.36 Oceans of ink have been 
spilled  by  those  worried  about  how  the  dramatic  expansion  of 
technologically  fueled  corporate  surveillance  of  our  private  lives 
automatically expands police surveillance, too, thanks to the way the 
Supreme Court has construed the reasonable expectation of privacy 
test and the third-party doctrine.37 The Fourth Amendment protects 
only that which is protected by a “reasonable expectation of privacy” 
(REP).38 This requires a two-pronged analysis, “first that a person have 
exhibited  an  actual  (subjective)  expectation  of  privacy  and,  second, 
that the expectation be one that society is prepared to recognize as 
‘reasonable.’”39 The third-party doctrine says that information a person 
voluntarily discloses to a third party is not protected by a reasonable 
expectation of privacy.40 
With  Carpenter,  the  Supreme  Court  reinvents  the  REP  test. 
Until now, the Supreme Court has always paid more attention to the 
nature of the police intrusion required to obtain information than to 
the nature of the information obtained. Information has been deemed

  7 protected  by  REP  because  the  police  obtained  it  using  advanced 
thermal imaging tools,41 or a wireless beeper located inside a house.42 
Information has fallen outside an REP when obtained from trash left 
on the curb,43 low-flying aircraft,44 or a wireless beeper traveling on 
public  roads.45  The  analysis  has  always  turned  primarily  on  the 
invasion and only secondarily on the information. 
Carpenter  heralds  a  new  mode  of  Constitutional  analysis, 
because the Court finds an REP based largely on an analysis of the 
information divorced from the actions of the police, database owner, or 
surveillance target. The most important holding—which commanded 
the  votes  of  five  justices—“is  that  “individuals  have  a  reasonable 
expectation of privacy in the whole of their physical movements.”46 The 
Court explains that a database full of CSLI meets this standard using 
an  analysis  focused  exclusively  on  the  nature  of  the  data  in  the 
database and the target’s role in the initial collection of it. 
Next,  with  Carpenter,  the  Supreme  Court  has  declared  the 
third-party doctrine to be almost dead. The majority opinion decline[d] 
to extend” the third-party doctrine to the collection by the FBI from 
cellphone providers of seven-days of CSLI.47 “Given the unique nature 
of  cell  phone  location  information,  the  fact  that  the  Government 
obtained  the  information  from  a  third  party  does  not  overcome 
Carpenter’s claim to Fourth Amendment protection.”48  
Even  on  their  own  terms,  these  two  holdings  have  sweeping 
consequences for privacy and law enforcement. But it’s the way Chief 
Justice  Roberts  reasoned  his  way  to  them  that  assures  that  this 
opinion will be applied far beyond the facts of this case. 
First, as described in the majority and dissenting opinions, the 
CSLI  that  has  just  been  protected  isn’t  terribly  precise.49  If  the 
majority had placed an exaggerated gloss on the precision of CSLI at 
issue in this case, it would have given the government a way in future 
cases to distinguish other types of location information: “the data at 
issue in this case is not controlled by Carpenter,” the government could 
have argued, “because it is far less precise than CSLI.” 
It will be difficult to make this argument because the majority 
opinion  informs  us  that  the  CSLI  records  in  this  case  “placed

  8 [Carpenter] within a wedge-shaped sector ranging from one-eighth to 
four  square  miles.”50  In  his  dissent,  Justice  Kennedy  characterizes 
these dimensions as “covering between a dozen and several hundred 
city  blocks”  in  cities  and  “up  to  40  times  more  imprecise”  in  rural 
areas.51 GPS this certainly is not. The Chief Justice waves this away, 
in part, because “the rule this Court adopts ‘must take account of more 
sophisticated systems that are already in use or in development’”.52  
Second, the majority opinion is not restricted to CSLI, even on 
its own terms. Instead, this is an opinion about information the police 
can use to locate people generally, not CSLI specifically.53 Part III of 
the opinion is all about the privacy interests individuals have in “the 
whole  of  their  physical  movements.”54  This  is  a  meditation  on  the 
nature  of  location  information,  whatever  form  it  takes.  Geolocation 
information, when there is enough of it, “provides an intimate window 
into a person’s life”, quoting Justice Sotomayor’s celebrated opinion 
from Jones, revealing “familial, political, professional, religious, and 
sexual associations.”55 This case is “not about ‘using a phone’ . . . [i]t is 
about  a  detailed  chronicle  of  a  person’s  physical  presence  compiled 
every day, every moment, over several years.”56 It is about “a trail of 
location data.”57 
By focusing on the nature of the information rather than on the 
telecommunications nitty-gritty used to gather the information or the 
structure  of  the  database  in  which  the  information  was  held,  this 
opinion  clearly  signals  that  its  holding  will  apply  to  other  massive 
collections  of  historical  geolocation  information,  of  which  there  are 
many.  Many  smartphone  apps  collect  precise  GPS  information, 
including apps that have no need for this kind of information except to 
sell to advertisers.58 It’s not just your smartphone, as GPS information

that  every  database  of  location  information  generated  by  every 
technology listed above will fall within the Carpenter reasoning, but 
the police should think twice before trying to collect any of it without a

Third,  the  majority  opinion  will  probably  even  apply  to

location  may  be  inferred.  “[T]he  Court  has  already  rejected  the 
proposition that ‘inference insulates a search’”,60 quoting Kyllo once 
again. The opinion highlights how the government could use CSLI “in 
combination  with  other  information,  [to]  deduce  a  detailed  log  of 
Carpenter’s movements.”61 Many databases that do not store location 
information directly can be used to infer location information. Credit 
card records, automatic toll transponder records, automated license-
plate records, etc., can all generate inferences about a person’s location 
that  are  far  more  precise  than  CSLI.62  Any  time  the  government

This  gives  the  lie  to  something  the  majority  said  that  has 
puzzled commenters: “We do not . . . call into question conventional 
surveillance techniques and tools, such as security cameras.”63 What 
the  Chief  Justice  misses  in  this  simple  statement  is  how  facial 
recognition technology has advanced to the point that a huge archive of 
security  camera  footage  can  easily  be  transformed  into  a  huge 
database tracking the location of identified individuals.64 It might be 
that  CSLI  records  track  location  far  more  comprehensively  than

Carpenter’s  reasoning  whenever  the  police  use  massive  databases 
assembled by private parties that reveal location information, directly

unrelated to location. The broad reasoning of the majority’s opinion 
will give all of them plenty to work with. Anticipating this, risk-averse 
police departments will err on the side of caution, getting a warrant for 
data whenever they can, and turning promising leads into dead ends 
whenever  they  can’t.  It’s  a  powerful  reminder  of  the  ability  the

  11 B.  What is the Carpenter Test? 
The test that emerges from the majority opinion will also be 
applied to collections of information maintained by third parties that 
do not track location, not even by inference, but are of interest to law 
enforcement. Going forward, whenever the government obtains a copy 
of  a  massive  database  of  information  containing  non-public 
information about individuals, judges will conduct a qualitative and 
quantitative assessment of the information, using a new, multi-factor 
test.  This  assessment  will  answer  two  questions:  first,  does  the 
individual  whose  information  has  been  obtained  have  a  reasonable 
expectation  of  privacy  in  the  database?  Second,  even  if  that 
information has been collected and is being maintained by a private 
third party, does the third-party doctrine apply?  
There  is  likely  to  be  disagreement  about  the  precise  list  of 
Carpenter  factors,  given  the  wide  ranging  nature  of  the  opinion. 
Different  characteristics  of  CSLI  data  and  smartphone  use  are 
emphasized  throughout  the  Chief  Justice’s  opinion.66  Still,  in 
concluding  the  opinion,  he  helpfully  isolates  three  factors:  (1)  “the 
deeply revealing nature” of the information; (2) “its depth, breadth, 
and  comprehensive  reach”;  (3)  “and  the  inescapable  and  automatic 
nature of its collection.”67 To this list, I would add a fourth factor, how 
much does access to this data give the police a gain in efficiency as 
compared  to  historical  surveillance  practice?68  In  weighing  each  of 
these, the Chief Justice keeps in view two overarching purposes for the 
Fourth Amendment: “to secure ‘the privacies of life’ against ‘arbitrary 
power’” and “‘to place obstacles in the way of a too permeating police 
surveillance.’”69 
Later, we will probe the theoretical foundations and normative 
desirability of this test,70 but for now, let us note the similarity of the 
test to the work of Susan Freiwald.71 Freiwald has long advocated that 
the Court embrace her own four factor test for deciding whether there 
is  an  invasion  of  REP  in  electronic  surveillance.72  She  argues  that 
courts should inquire whether the police are using a “hidden, intrusive,

  12 indiscriminate, and continuous method of surveillance.”73 Using this 
test, she bested the Supreme Court by seven years, arguing in 2011 
that the police should be required to obtain a warrant to access CSLI.74 
I  will  highlight  in  the  discussion  below  how  the  Freiwald  factors 
correspond to the Carpenter factors. 
Let  us  consider  each  of  the  Carpenter  factors  in  turn.  The 
sections that follow will highlight the key language from the majority 
opinion  about  each  factor,  as  well  as  focus  on  language  from  the 
various dissents that sharpen the meaning or import of each factor. 
These  sections  will  also  connect  most  of  the  factors  to  the  broader 
world of privacy law and scholarship beyond this case. This is meant to 
address a criticism that has been directed at the majority’s opinion: its 
failure to cite any legal scholarship.75 The Court could have supported 
each of its points with scholarly citation. This opinion resonates with 
two  decades  of  writing  about  the  Fourth  Amendment  in  an  age  of 
rapidly changing technology, regardless of whether the Chief Justice 
was aware of any of this work. Consider this the majority’s missing cite 
check, demonstrating the rigor and theoretical underpinnings of this 
approach. 
1.  First Factor: Deeply Revealing Nature 
The  Carpenter  test  protects  information  only  if  it  is  “deeply 
revealing” of some private quality of the person under surveillance.76 
“As with GPS information, the time-stamped data provides an intimate 
window  into  a  person’s  life,  revealing  not  only  his  particular 
movements,  but  through  them  his  “familial,  political,  professional, 
religious, and sexual associations.”77 These location records “hold for 
many Americans the ‘privacies of life.’”78 
This factor is perhaps the most important. Information stored by 
a  private  third  party  must  in  some  way  be  deemed  sensitive  or 
intimate to fall within the reasonable expectation of privacy test. These 
two words, although similar to one another, have different meanings. 
Sensitive  information  is  information  that  can  be  used  to  cause  an 
individual or group harm.79 In contrast, intimate information reveals 
something  important  and  not  widely  known  about  a  relationship 
between individuals.80

[hereinafter Ohm, Sensitive Information]. 
80 JULIE C. INNESS, PRIVACY, INTIMACY, AND ISOLATION 56 (1992). 
  13 The connection between sensitive and intimate information and 
the REP test has a long doctrinal lineage. Professor Orin Kerr argues 
that  the  Supreme  Court  has  adopted  four  different  models  for 
assessing whether police practice implicates a reasonable expectation 
of privacy, one of which is a “private facts” model, which measures the 
sensitivity  and  intimacy  of  the  information  obtained.81  This  factor 
mirrors  Freiwald’s  “intrusiveness”  factor,  which  considers  what  a 
surveillance technique reveals.82  
The road to the Court’s recognition of this factor was paved by 
the two blockbuster opinions from recent years about technology and 
the  Fourth  Amendment,  United  States  v.  Jones  and  Riley  v. 
California.83 The notion that detailed location information can reveal 
the “familial, political, professional, religious, and sexual associations” 
comes  from  Justice  Sotomayor’s  concurrence  in  Jones,  perhaps  the 
single most important quote ever uttered in a Supreme Court opinion 
about the sensitivity of information.84 The idea that a smart phone can 
“hold for many Americans, the ‘privacies of life’” comes from the Chief 
Justice’s opinion in Riley.85 
As  discussed  earlier,  this  factor  focuses  exclusively  on  an 
analysis of the intrinsic nature of the information itself, divorced from 
any  consideration  of  what  the  police  had  to  do  to  obtain  it,  the 
company’s incentives for gathering it, or the individual could have done 
to prevent it. This is a fundamental break from Fourth Amendment 
analyses of the past, which always placed police action and individual 
counter-action at the center, and information on the periphery. 
2.  Second Factor: Depth, Breadth, and Comprehensive Reach 
The Carpenter test protects information that possesses “depth, 
breadth, and comprehensive reach”.86 Like the first factor, this focuses 
on the intrinsic nature of the information.  
Justice Kennedy, in dissent, provides his own list of the factors 
he sees in the majority’s opinion, to criticize the majority’s “unstable 
foundation”.87  His  list  boils  down  this  factor  into  a  single  one, 
“comprehensiveness,”88 but it is better to treat this as three distinct

“probabilistic”, “positive law”, and “policy”. Id. at 506. We will return to this later.

  14 requirements (meaning our three factors might instead be treated as 
five). All three speak to the quantity, primarily, of information stored. 
But they measure a database along three distinct dimensions. 
Depth  refers  to  the  detail  and  precision  of  the  information 
stored.89 This is closely related to the deeply revealing nature factor, as 
it  is  the  precision  of  location  information  that  triggers  Justice 
Sotomayor’s litany of private inferences—location information betrays 
a person’s political, sexual, religious associations only if is sufficiently 
precise  to  imply  visits  to  particular  storefronts,  homes,  or  other 
individual locations.90 The Carpenter majority emphasizes that CSLI 
stores “the whole of [a person’s] physical movements”91 as well as “a 
detailed chronicle of a person’s physical presence.”92 
In contrast, breadth refers to time in two ways: how frequently 
is the data collected, and for how long has the data been recorded?93 
CSLI qualifies as broad in both senses, because the database at issue 
in Carpenter stored “an average of 101 data points every day” of the 
defendant’s location,94 and because cell phone providers tend to store 
data for five years.95 Every one of us “has effectively been tailed every 
moment of every day for five years.”96 It is information “compiled every 
day, every moment, over several years.”97 
Finally,  comprehensive  reach  refers  to  the  number  of  people 
tracked in the database.98 This recognizes that “there, but by the grace 
of  the  police,  go  I.”  “Critically,  because  location  information  is 
continually  logged  for  all  of  the  400  million  devices  in  the  United 
States—not just those belonging to persons who might happen to come 
under investigation— this newfound tracking capacity runs against 
everyone.”99 This is critical because, “[u]nlike with the GPS device in

in  combination  with  other  information,  deduce  a  detailed  log  of  Carpenter's

thought the CSLI accurate enough to highlight it during the closing argument of his 
trial.”).

and absolute surveillance.”). 
99 Id. at 2218. 
  15 Jones, police need not even know in advance whether they want to 
follow a particular individual, or when.”100 
Two  of  Freiwald’s  four  factors  anticipated  these  Carpenter 
factors, the “continuous” and “indiscriminate” nature of surveillance.101 
She considers these factors important because they increase the odds 
that  the  government  will  conduct  surveillance  “without  sufficient 
justification” and which reveals “activities that are entirely unrelated 
to criminal actions.”102 
By  identifying  these  factors,  the  Court  embraces  the  mosaic 
theory of privacy.103 The mosaic theory is animated by an idea that 
finds support both in folk wisdom and modern machine learning: the 
whole is greater than the sum of the parts.104 It first found expression 
in Fourth Amendment jurisprudence in United States v. Maynard, the 
D.C. Circuit opinion that was renamed United States v. Jones on its 
way to the Supreme Court.105 In the majority opinion in Maynard, 
Judge Ginsburg concluded that “[p]rolonged surveillance reveals types 
of information not revealed by short-term surveillance, such as what a 
person  does  repeatedly,  what  he  does  not  do,  and  what  he  does 
ensemble. These types of information can each reveal more about a 
person than does any individual trip viewed in isolation.”106 Although 
the Jones majority chose not to embrace the mosaic theory, focusing 
instead on the physical trespass that occurred during the installation 
of the GPS tracking device, Carpenter seems to revive the idea. 
The mosaic theory bring us to footnote three of Carpenter: 
 
The  parties  suggest  as  an  alternative  to  their  primary 
submissions that the acquisition of CSLI becomes a search only 
if it extends beyond a limited period. As part of its argument, 
the Government treats the seven days of CSLI requested from 
Sprint  as  the  pertinent  period,  even  though  Sprint  produced 
only  two  days  of  records.  Contrary  to  Justice  KENNEDY's 
assertion, we need not decide whether there is a limited period 
for which the Government may obtain an individual's historical

  16 CSLI free from Fourth Amendment scrutiny, and if so, how long 
that period might be. It is sufficient for our purposes today to 
hold  that  accessing  seven  days  of  CSLI  constitutes  a  Fourth 
Amendment search.107 
 
Several  dissents  criticized  the  seeming  arbitrariness  of  this 
seven-day rule.108 Footnote three is likely to spark scholarly criticism 
and commentary.109 Any opinion that tries to give force to the mosaic 
theory has to draw a line.110 Given the role that the quantity factors 
play  in  the  majority’s  reasoning,  it  seems  likely  that  a  database 
containing a single datum that revealed a single registration between 
a cell phone and cell site would not trigger nearly the same privacy 
concerns. A single data point would be neither as deep, broad, nor 
comprehensive, as seven days (much less five years) of CSLI. For that 
reason, it would not be nearly as “deeply revealing”. A future court 
asked to rule on the warrantless access of a single datum of location 
information might well distinguish it from the facts and reasoning of 
Carpenter. 
While one point of information might not suffice, one should not 
read too much into the seven day figure. For one thing, this is the 
figure that the facts presented: the government sought seven days of 
CSLI.111 In fact, the order seeking seven days of information elicited 
only  two  days  of  CSLI.112  The  Court  gave  no  principled  reason  for 
selecting seven days as the cut-off, so we ought not consider it the 
precise  dividing  line.  Future  opinions  will  need  to  analyze  the 
relationship between the temporal breadth of data and the impact on 
privacy interests. 
These quantitative facts are sure to be the source of confusion in 
the  lower  courts—and  inside  police  stations—and  the  target  of 
criticism from other scholars. What if a database has only two forms of 
quantitative comprehensiveness—say depth and breadth—but about 
only  one  person  rather  than  with  comprehensive  reach?  What  if  a 
database reveals deep information about many people, but recorded at 
a single moment in time? 
One potential complicating scenario was expressly referenced in 
the  majority  opinion:  does  a  real-time,  future-looking,  prospective

  17 collection of data trigger this factor and thus the Carpenter rule?113 
The majority opinion expressly declined to say.114 At the same time, it 
emphasizes repeatedly the retrospective nature of CSLI information, 
and indeed, Justice Kennedy includes “retrospectivity” in his summary 
of the factors, although the majority opinion does not.115 What will 
lower courts say about real-time CSLI collection? 
On the one hand, it is clear that the majority opinion is quite 
worried about the time travel nature of the CSLI database, which isn’t 
implicated in the same way by real-time data gathering.116 Real-time 
CSLI gathering can be “switched on” for a specific target, allowing it to 
be pinpointed rather than amassed indiscriminately.  
But  on  the  other  hand,  retrospectivity  is  just  one  version  of 
problematic  “breadth”,  and  should  be  seen  as  such,  rather  than 
treating retrospectivity as a necessary requirement. There might be 
databases that collect a broad swath of data across time without being 
retrospective in the same way as the CSLI database. A police order 
commanding a phone company to collect CSLI in real-time about one 
individual  for  seven  days,  would  be  an  example.117  Or  consider  a 
database that stores retrospective information only about some people

  18 but not everybody in the database.118 So long as the information is 
deep, broad, and of comprehensive reach, it should trigger this factor, 
whether or not it is retrospective in the same way.  
3.  Factor Three: Inescapable and Automatic Nature of the 
Collection 
The  first  two  factors  focus  on  the  intrinsic  nature  of  the 
information. They analyze information as a database designer would, 
interrogating the qualitative and quantitative information content of 
the data, and the inferences that can be drawn from them. The other 
two factors operate in a much more traditional mode, focusing in factor 
three on what the database owner and data subject have done (or could 
have done) and in factor four on how the information empowers the 
police.  
The  third  factor,  the  final  factor  the  majority  cites,  is  the 
“inescapable  and  automatic  nature”  of  how  the  information  is 
collected.119  This  factor  speaks  to  whether  the  targets  of  the 
surveillance  could  be  said  to  have  assumed  the  risk  of  the  data 
collection or knowingly exposed information to the private party.120 
This factor (really two separate factors) brings into the analysis the 
idea  that  individuals  might  sometimes  relinquish  their  Fourth 
Amendment  rights  when  they  assume  the  risk  of  surveillance,  for 
example by publishing information to the general public. 
This connects to Freiwald’s factor of “hidden” surveillance. She 
argues  that  surveillance  conducted  without  the  awareness  of  the 
person being observed introduces a risk “that agents will exceed the 
scope of a proper investigation with impunity.”121 
Some data collections are inescapable because they relate to a 
service one needs to use to be a functioning member of modern society. 
In the case of CSLI, cell phones are “‘such a pervasive and insistent 
part of daily life’ that carrying one is indispensable to participation in 
                                            
118 For example, under the USA FREEDOM Act, the NSA can request telephony 
metadata records relating to a suspect and everyone within “two hops” of contact 
with  of  the  suspect.  18  U.S.C.  §  1861(c)(2)(F)(iii)-(iv)  (permitting  two  hops  of 
production of call detail records). Researchers estimate that this can net the records 
of approximately 25,000 subscribers with a single search. Jonathan Mayer et al.,

121 Freiwald, Cell Phone Location Data, supra note 71, at 747. 
  19 modern society.”122 The opinion makes this point in dramatic fashion, 
borrowing from the Chief Justice’s opinion in Riley: 
 
Unlike the bugged container in Knotts or the car in Jones, a cell 
phone—almost a “feature of human anatomy,” Riley, 573 U. S., 
at ___ (slip op., at 9)—tracks nearly exactly the movements of its 
owner.  While  individuals  regularly  leave  their  vehicles,  they 
compulsively carry cell phones with them all the time. A cell 
phone faithfully follows its owner beyond public thoroughfares 
and  into  private  residences,  doctor’s  offices,  political 
headquarters, and other potentially revealing locales. See id., at 
___ (slip op., at 19) (noting that “nearly three-quarters of smart 
phone users report being within five feet of their phones most of 
the time, with 12% admit- ting that they even use their phones 
in the shower”); contrast Cardwell v. Lewis, 417 U. S. 583, 590 
(1974) (plurality opinion) (“A car has little capacity for escaping 
public scrutiny.”).123 
 
Perhaps reflecting how some members of modern society feel 
shackled  to  these  devices,  the  Chief  Justice  deploys  an  especially 
evocative simile: “when the Government tracks the location of a cell 
phone it achieves near perfect surveillance, as if it had attached an 
ankle monitor to the phone’s user.”124 
Inescapability is not the same as the automatic nature of the 
information  collected.  CSLI  is  automatically  part  of  cell  service 
because the records are generated whenever the service is used, and 
there is no opportunity to opt out.125 
 
[A] cell phone logs a cell-site record by dint of its operation, 
without  any  affirmative  act  on  the  part  of  the  user  beyond 
powering  up.  Virtually  any  activity  on  the  phone  generates 
CSLI, including incoming calls, texts, or e-mails and countless 
other data connections that a phone automatically makes when 
checking for news, weather, or social media updates. Apart from 
disconnecting the phone from the network, there is no way to 
avoid leaving behind a trail of location data. As a result, in no 
meaningful sense does the user voluntarily “assume[] the risk” 
of  turning  over  a  comprehensive  dossier  of  his  physical 
movements.126

  20  
Once  again,  lower  courts  might  have  difficulty  applying  this 
factor  to  technologies  that  are  automatic  but  not  inescapable—say 
tracking by a particular mobile app that is voluntarily installed and 
can be deleted with one click—or tracking that is inescapable but not 
automatic—say the manual logging of a patient’s symptoms taken by a 
doctor who provides a meaningful opt-out. 
4.  Factor Four? Efficiency Gain 
One  other  factor  played  a  vital  role  in  the  analysis  of  the 
majority opinion, yet is not listed in the helpful summary at the end: 
the relative efficiency with which the data allows the police to learn 
information  about  a  target,  as  compared  to  what  it  would  have 
required to collect equivalent data in an earlier technological age.127 
 
Prior to the digital age, law enforcement might have pursued a 
suspect for a brief stretch, but doing so “for any extended period 
of  time  was  difficult  and  costly  and  therefore  rarely 
undertaken.”  For  that  reason,  “society’s  expectation  has  been 
that law enforcement agents and others would not— and indeed, 
in the main, simply could not—secretly monitor and catalogue 
every single movement of an individual’s car for a very long 
period.” . . . And like GPS monitoring, cell phone tracking is 
remarkably easy, cheap, and efficient compared to traditional 
investigative  tools.  With  just  the  click  of  a  button,  the 
Government  can  access  each  carrier’s  deep  repository  of 
historical location information at practically no expense.128 
 
The  two  internal  quotes  come  from  Justice  Alito’s  concurrence  in 
Jones, which also placed great weight on preventing the power of the 
police to increase dramatically through the progress of technology.129 It 
connects to the Carpenter majority’s invocation of the idea that the 
“central aim of the Framers was “to place obstacles in the way of a too 
permeating police surveillance.”130 Carpenter puts to rest the dictum in 
United States v. Knotts that “We have never equated police efficiency 
with unconstitutionality, and we decline to do so now.”131 
  The notion that the Fourth Amendment should prevent massive 
and sudden gains in police power thanks to technology connects to a 
                                            
127 In a different summary of the reasoning of the opinion, the Chief Justice did focus 
on this factor: “Much like GPS tracking of a vehicle, cell phone location information is 
detailed, encyclopedic, and effortlessly compiled.” Id. at 10.

  21 broad range of legal scholarship.132 Of most direct relevance, it stems 
from an important article by Kevin Bankston and Ashkan Soltani.133 
They  argue  that  the  police  engage  in  a  Fourth  Amendment  search 
whenever a new technology makes it “much less expensive” to collect 
information  about  individuals.134  The  Article  presents  a  compelling 
case  that  the  facts  of  Jones  meets  this  standard,  because  a  police-
installed  GPS  tracker  significantly  reduces  the  cost  of  location 
tracking. They lend rigor to this conclusion by meticulously reading 
FBI pursuit manuals and cross-referencing them to FBI Special Agent 
salary  tables  to  conclude  that  a  GPS  tracker  is  twenty-eight  times 
cheaper than covert pursuit, while tracking location by cell phone—
akin to the facts of Carpenter—is almost twice as cheap as GPS.135 
  Bankston  and  Soltani  pay  due  to  other  scholarship,  most 
importantly Orin Kerr’s theory of equilibrium adjustment.136 According 
to this influential theory, “When new tools and new practices threaten 
to expand or contract police power in a significant way, courts adjust 
the level of Fourth Amendment protection to try to restore the prior 
equilibrium.”137  Carpenter  is  the  ultimate  embrace  of  both  the 
Bankston-Soltani  theory  of  efficiency  and  the  Kerr  theory  of 
equilibrium adjustment.138 
5.  The Test 
To  summarize,  Carpenter  promulgates  a  new  four-factor  test 
that should be applied not necessarily to the specific facts of a case but

ask whether that category of information (1) has a deeply revealing 
nature;  (2)  possesses  depth,  breadth,  and  comprehensive  reach;  (3) 
results from an inescapable and automatic for of data collection; and 
(4) represents a powerful gain in the efficiency of the police.  
C.  Applying the Carpenter Test 
Under  this  test,  what  other  databases  full  of  third-party 
collected  records  are  likely  to  be  found  protected  by  a  reasonable 
expectation  of  privacy  and  fall  outside  the  third-party  doctrine? 
Consider a few examples. 
1.  Very Likely Covered: Web Browsing Records 
I  am  confident  that  the  Carpenter  test  will  extend  Fourth 
Amendment protection to web-browsing records collected by ISPs (or 
browser or operating system manufacturers). Justice Kennedy raises 
this  prospect,  complaining  that  the  majority  opinion  doesn’t  reveal 
whether the seven-day threshold “should apply to information like IP 
addresses or website browsing history.”139 
Web browsing records possess a “deeply revealing nature”, even 
if they record only the IP addresses of websites visited.140 In 2009, I 
argued that “[t]he potential inconvenience, embarrassment, hardship, 
or pain that could result from the trove of data of [ISP monitoring] is 
limited only by the wickedness of one’s imagination.”141 More recently, 
and succinctly, I testified to Congress that: 
  
The  list  of  websites  an  individual  visits,  available  to  a 
[broadband Internet access service] provider even when https 
encryption is used, reveals so much more than a member of a 
prior generation would have revealed in a composite list of every 
book she had checked out, every newspaper and magazine she 
had subscribed to, every theater she had visited, every television 
channel  she  had  clicked  to,  and  every  bulletin,  leaflet,  and 
handout she had read. No power in the technological history of 
our nation has been able until now to watch us read individual 
articles,  calculate  how  long  we  linger  on  a  given  page,  and 
reconstruct the entire intellectual history of what we read and 
watch on a minute-by-minute, individual-by-individual basis.142 
                                            
139 Carpenter v. United States, 138 S. Ct. 2206, 2234 (2018) (Kennedy, J., dissenting).

Subcomm. on Commc'n & Tech. of the H. Comm. on Energy and Commerce, 114th 
Cong.  5  (2016)  (statement  of  Georgetown  Law  Professor  Paul  Ohm), 
  23  
Similarly,  Neil  Richards  has  written  about  the  sensitivity  of 
records of “intellectual privacy” like these.143 “Intellectual records—
such as lists of Web sites visited, books owned, or terms entered into a 
search  engine—are  in  a  very  real  sense  a  partial  transcript  of  the 
operation of a human mind. They implicate the freedom of thought and 
the  freedom  of  intellectual  exploration.”144  He  argues  that  First 
Amendment  concerns  add  a  gloss  to  the  Fourth  Amendment  and 
should require warrants for access to records like these.145 
The  efficiency  gain  represented  by  web-browsing  records  is 
profound.  Just  as  CSLI  has  given  the  police  unprecedented  power 
tracking the location of targets at very low cost, so too can the police 
for the first time in human history access the reading habits of millions 
through their web browsing records with very little expense or effort.146  
The “depth, breadth, and comprehensive nature” factor is sure to 
be  more  contestable  when  applied  to  web  browsing  records.  This 
precise  question  has  recently  been  debated  publicly  in  the  Federal 
Communications Commission, which enacted a sweeping broadband 
privacy rule in the final days of the Obama administration only to have 
Congress  roll  back  the  rule  in  the  early  days  of  the  Trump 
administration.147 In those proceedings, ISP lobbyists argued that their 
view into individual reading habits was far from comprehensive—in 
Carpenter’s  terms,  they  lacked  depth  and  breadth—because 
individuals surf the web via different ISPs.148 In the course of a single 
day,  many  people  surf  on  their  phone,  their  home  broadband 
connection, and their work connection, using a different ISP for each 
one.149 The police might plausibly argue that this distinguishes web 
browsing data from CSLI, because people tend to carry their cell phone

  24 in their pockets or purses throughout the day. Your cell phone works 
like a passive tracking device, sending pings to the nearest cell tower 
whenever you are using your phone and sometimes even when you are 
not.150 
Finally, the police might argue that that web browsing records 
generated by an ISP are not “inescapable and automatic” in the same 
way  as  CSLI,  because  web  browsing  is  an  intentional  and  visible 
behavior—a  record  is  logged  whenever  you  use  your  phone  or 
computer’s web browser to access the web.151 
Lower courts thus might struggle with the uncertainty inherent 
in a multi-factor test. ISP-generated web browsing records are much 
more deeply revealing and represent more of an efficiency gain than 
CSLI  records.152  Although  they  are  deep,  broad,  of  comprehensive 
reach, inescapable, and automatic, they might not rise for these factors 
to the same levels as CSLI. 
I predict courts will have little difficulty holding that massive 
databases that record the IP addresses visited by an individual will 
meet the four factor test, even though a few factors cut in the other 
direction. Police access to these records will constitute a search and the 
third-party doctrine will not extend to cover them. Going forward, the 
police  are  well-advised  to  seek  records  like  these  only  after  first 
obtaining a warrant. 
2.  Most Likely Covered: Massive Collections of Telephone and 
Bank Records 
Perhaps counter-intuitively, the police most likely now need a 
warrant to obtain massive collections of phone records or bank records, 
the same category of records held not to require a warrant in the third-
party  doctrine  cases,  Smith  v.  Maryland153  and  Miller  v.  United 
States.154  Even  though  the  Court  declined  to  overturn  those  cases, 
hints throughout the Carpenter opinions suggest that, some day, these 
two  opinions  will  be  narrowed  to  the  relatively  non-comprehensive 
quantities available in the 1970s.155

155 Carpenter, 138 S. Ct. at 2217 (declining to extend but not overturning Smith and 
Miller). 
  25 Bank records and phone records can be as deeply revealing as 
CSLI.  Carpenter’s  dissenting  opinions  make  this  plain.  Justice 
Kennedy  concludes  that  “[t]he  troves  of  intimate  information  the 
Government can and does obtain using financial records and telephone 
records dwarfs what can be gathered from cell-site records.”156 Justice 
Gorsuch  asks,  “[w]hy  is  someone’s  location  when  using  a  phone  so 
much  more  sensitive  than  who  he  was  talking  to  (Smith)  or  what 
financial transactions he engaged in (Miller)?”157 These passages will 
be quoted the first time a defendant challenges the warrantless access 
by police to large quantities of this kind of information. Say the police 
use a subpoena to obtain years of credit card transactions or the NSA 
uses sub-warrant process to obtain millions of telephone metadata. It 
is now quite likely that courts will require a warrant for this kind of 
information, citing Carpenter’s new test. 
These courts will now be able to distinguish Smith and Miller 
because modern technology tends to produce databases of telephone or 
financial information that are far more voluminous and detailed than 
the records at issue in those 1970s cases. With the ubiquity of credit 
and  decline  of  cash,  almost  every  commercial  transaction  we  make 
ends up in a bank record. These might today include great detail about 
what has been purchased, or a note by the merchant. Similarly, more 
metadata about communications is collected by today’s telephones than 
in the past. Computer storage is much cheaper and easier to access 
than the paper records of the 1970’s, reducing the incentive to ever 
delete anything.158 
This shines new light on the dueling district court opinions that 
passed judgment on the NSA’s massive telephony metadata program 
in 2013, one distinguishing Smith and the other feeling bound by the 
precedent. In Klayman v. Obama, Judge Richard Leon of the District 
Court for the District of Columbia held that the telephony program 
likely violated the Fourth Amendment, expressly declining to follow 
Smith.159  “[T]he  Smith  pen  register  and  the  ongoing  NSA  Bulk 
Telephony Metadata Program have so many significant distinctions 
between them that I cannot possibly navigate these uncharted Fourth 
Amendment waters using as my North Star a case that predates the 
rise  of  cell  phones.”160  Less  than  two  weeks  later,  Judge  William 
Pauley, in ACLU v. Clapper, came to the opposite conclusion, finding

  26 that  Smith  controlled.161  “Because Smith controls,  the  NSA's  bulk 
telephony  metadata  collection  program  does  not  violate  the  Fourth 
Amendment.”162 
History,  in  the  form  of  Carpenter,  has  been  much  kinder  to 
Judge  Leon.  A  lower  court  judge  trying  to  rule  today  that  Smith 
controls would have to work much harder than Judge Pauley did, to 
distinguish Carpenter. Judge Pauley’s reasoning seemed essentially to 
be that zero times a massive number is still equal to zero. Smith found 
no protectable Fourth Amendment interest in the numbers dialed for a 
single telephone customer, and no Fourth Amendment interest springs 
forth from the collection of the dialing habits of tens of millions of 
customers.163 
Carpenter  makes  clear  that  the  scale  of  data  collection 
matters.164 Constitutionally  meaningful privacy can spring forth when 
records amass in the millions. Judge Pauley’s reasoning should now be 
seen as defective, especially held next to Judge Leon’s approach, which 
anticipated the Carpenter reasoning, albeit using different factors and 
language.  Judge  Leon  offered  four  reasons  to  distinguish  the  NSA 
program from the facts of Smith. First, Smith involved data collected 
over a shorter time frame—14 days versus months or years.165 Second, 
the detailed program between the NSA and the telephone companies 
created a far more intertwined relationship than the one-off request in 
Smith.166 Third, the NSA had the technological capability “to store and 
analyze the phone metadata of every telephone user in the United 
States,” providing perhaps the closest parallel between this opinion 
and Carpenter.167 Finally, telephony metadata can reveal much more 
sensitive information than the phone records of the late-1970s.168 
Had Judge Leon’s opinion been written after Carpenter, it would 
have been seen as a direct application of the new opinion. Massive 
databases  of  telephony  phone  records  implicate  every  one  of  Chief 
Justice’s  concerns  about  CSLI.  The  NSA’s  program  implicated  the 
Fourth Amendment, notwithstanding the supposed continued vitality

metadata.169 
3.  Uncertain Application: Databases of Medical Records and 
Genetic Information 
The  examples  covered  so  far—massive  databases  of  web 
browsing habits, telephone dialing records, and financial records—each 
satisfy all, or nearly all, of the four Carpenter factors and thus are 
likely to be found to be searches. But other databases of investigatory 
interest face a far less certain fate under the new test. 
Under  rules  promulgated  under  the  Health  Insurance 
Portability  and  Accountability  Act  (HIPAA),  law  enforcement  can 
access medical records stored by a covered provider with a grand jury 
subpoena.170 Has Carpenter upset this rule, rendering this regulatory 
scheme  now  unconstitutional?  Does  a  large  database  of  health 
information now require a warrant to access?  
For  two  of  the  four  Carpenter  factors,  one  could  argue  that 
medical records deserve as much or even more protection than CSLI. 
Medical  records  contain  symptoms,  diagnoses,  and  prescriptions, 
information that are likely far more deeply revealing than location 
information.171 Even compared to owning a smartphone, individuals 
cannot easily choose to avoid professional medical care, making the 
production  of  these  records  more  inescapable  and  automatic.  The 
breadth and efficiency gain sub-factors probably weigh about the same 
for these records as for CSLI: most medical providers keep records 
dating back to the beginning of the interaction with the patient, and it 
would  cost  the  police  an  exorbitant  sum  to  compile  the  kind  of 
information it can access for very little. 
The other subfactors and factors cut the other way. The main 
subfactor that distinguishes CSLI from medical records is depth. The 
metronomic regularity with which an individual’s location is tracked 
seemed quite important to the majority opinion.172 In contrast, most 
people interact with the health care system only on occasion.173 
While the creation of medical records might be as inescapable as 
CSLI, they usually are not as automatic. Unlike the take-it-or-leave-it 
and  invisible  quality  of  CSLI  gathering,  most  medical  records  are

173 The exceptions are hospitalized patients and people diagnosed with chronic or 
terminal conditions. Many of these people might be connected to 24/7 electronic 
devices that generate information in exactly the same fashion as a smart phone. 
  28 populated in clearly delineated interactions, when we are aware that 
we are being literally poked, prodded, and measured. 
Finally, although the rise of electronic health records has made 
access to historical health information more efficient, it has always 
been the case that your doctor maintained a historical record of your 
health history, in a single location that they could access with little 
expense, and that they could be compelled to hand over to the police 
bearing a subpoena or a warrant. The efficiency gains in this situation 
are not nearly as dramatic as they are for the tracking of location or 
reading habits.  
For  these  reasons,  lower  courts  will  consider  this  to  be  a 
relatively close call. For ordinary, healthy individuals, their medical 
records—while undoubtedly sensitive—are not nearly the product of 
the  same  kind  of  “tireless  and  absolute  surveillance”  at  issue  in 
Carpenter.174 The digitization of these records has not experienced the 
same dramatic gains in efficiency as the tracking of location or reading 
habits.  
What about a copy of an individual’s DNA stored with a private 
third party? In his dissent Justice Gorsuch opines without analysis 
that “most lawyers and judges today” would require a warrant and 
probable cause to access DNA voluntarily stored with 23andMe.175 This 
provides an important window into Justice Gorsuch’s baseline attitude 
about the Fourth Amendment, and it might offer a window into how to 
directly  appeal  to  him  in  the  future.  But  this  conclusion  certainly 
doesn’t flow from the Carpenter factors. 
Without doubt, a copy of an individuals’ genome satisfies the 
deeply revealing nature factor. Genetic information reveals propensity 
to  disease,  physical  and  mental  characteristics,  parentage,  and 
genealogy.176 It reveals this not only for the individual who uploaded 
the DNA but also for close relatives.177 
None of the other factors seem to trigger the same concerns as 
CSLI. A single copy of the three billion base pairs that comprise a 
human DNA does not track activity and change over time, as with 
most  of  the  other  examples  we  have  considered.  At  least  under 
23andMe’s  current  business  model,  submissions  are  fundamentally 
voluntary, although close relatives who did not submit their DNA will 
be able to argue about the inescapable nature of their presence in the

  29 data, if the police target them through their relatives’ submissions.178 
Finally, there are other ways to obtain and sequence DNA of a known 
individual that will be only marginally less efficient than a subpoena 
from 23andMe.179 
It seems unlikely that a court would require a warrant for DNA 
evidence held by a private third party based on a straight application 
of the Carpenter factors. This is not to say that there might not be 
other applications of the reasonable expectation of privacy test that 
would protect this information. It is a reminder that Carpenter is not 
the  only  path  to  finding  that  a  Fourth  Amendment  search  has 
occurred. 
The  basic  rule  of  Carpenter  alone  presents  a  fundamental 
change to Fourth Amendment doctrine. It requires a warrant in many 
situations where none were required before. But this important change 
is just the first of many found within the reasoning of this opinion. 
II.  BEYOND THE CORE TEST OF CARPENTER 
Based on the new substantive rule it announces, Carpenter is 
already  on  par  with  some  of  the  most  consequential  Fourth 
Amendment cases of all time. But when you look beyond the core rule 
to some of the other revolutions wrought in the opinion, it is possible to 
conclude that Carpenter represents a fundamental shift, not merely an 
incremental adaptation. It turns the third-party doctrine inside out, 
requiring  the  government  to  account  for  the  database  design  and 
information  gathering  decisions  of  private  parties,  decisions  made 
without any state intervention. Its broad reasoning will apply not only 
when  third  parties  are  involved  but  also  when  the  government 
conducts detailed digital surveillance by itself. And it creates three 
new  rules  of  technological  equivalence,  which  are  much  more 
straightforward to apply than the multi-factor test and which might 
end up be applied more often than the core rule. 
A.  The Third-Party Doctrine, Inside Out 
Carpenter  concludes  that  location  information  is  protected 
“[w]hether the Government employs its own surveillance technology as 
in Jones or leverages the technology of a wireless carrier . . . .”180 This 
quote is breathtaking. It calls into question the bedrock rule that the 
Fourth  Amendment  concerns  itself  only  with  the  activities  of  the 
government.181 The police has never before had to account so fully for

Genetic Privacy, 100 NW. U.L. REV. 857, 860-62 (2006). 
180 Carpenter, 138 S. Ct. at 2217. 
181  United  States  v.  Jacobsen,  466  U.S.  109,  113  (1984)  (“This  Court  has  also 
consistently construed this protection as proscribing only governmental action; it is 
  30 the independent decisions or actions of private actors. A private citizen 
could literally break into a house, break into a safe inside the house, 
steal what lay within the safe, and deliver the contents of the safe to 
the police.182 So long as the police had nothing to do with the thief 
before he arrived at the stationhouse, they would be free to use the 
contents in court.183 
For the first time, even though the police aren’t responsible for 
the  decisions  that  led  to  the  creation  of  a  collection  of  potential 
evidence, they nevertheless are held to account for the nature of the 
information  collected.  This  has  blurred  the  government  action 
requirement in some important ways. 
Of the four Carpenter factors, the one that is most influenced by 
the  choices  made  by  private  actors  is  “depth,  breadth,  and 
comprehensive  reach.”184  To  be  clear,  the  Court  doesn’t  seem  to  be 
delving  into  the  motivations  of  cell  phone  providers;  warrant 
suppression  hearings  will  not  turn  on  the  testimony  of  a  T-Mobile 
executive explaining why the company structures its data the way it 
does. But the Constitutional meaning of the word “search” in cases like 
these now turn intrinsically on the results of the business decisions of 
companies. 
Consider the breadth factor. The majority opinion emphasizes 
the importance of the “time machine” quality of CSLI. “With access to 
CSLI,  the  Government  can  now  travel  back  in  time  to  retrace  a 
person’s  whereabouts,  subject  only  to  the  retention  policies  of  the 
wireless  carriers,  which  currently  maintains  records  for  up  to  five 
years.”185 For the most part, corporate retention policies are not set by 
regulation, at least not in the United States.186 Each company must 
                                                                                                                       
wholly inapplicable to a search or seizure, even an unreasonable one, effected by a 
private individual not acting as an agent of the Government or with the participation 
or knowledge of any governmental official.”).

preservation” in the United States, in the absence of a data retention mandate). One 
rare  exception  is  that  the  FCC  requires  telephone  companies  to  keep  billing 
information about telephone toll calls for eighteen months. 47 C.F.R. § 42.6. In 2006,

  31 weigh the potential benefits of having access to old data against the 
cost  of  data  storage  and  the  potential  trouble  in  the  form  of 
cybersecurity risk or regulatory scrutiny. Practices vary widely even 
between  companies  in  the  same  industry.187  These  choices  are  not 
made in consultation with the police, yet Carpenter has now given 
these private decisions Constitutional weight.188 
The  same  can  be  said  for  the  depth  factor.  Every  company 
decides how much information to track and retain. Returning again to 
web-browsing surveillance, some ISPs retain very little evidence of the 
web  browsing  habits  of  their  customers;  others  deploy  deep  packet 
inspection  to  view  and  store  information  about  the  content  of 
communications between individuals and websites.189 The first time 
the  government  is  forced  to  defend  against  a  challenge  to  the 
warrantless access to this kind of information, its fate might turn on 
where the ISP chose to position itself along this spectrum. 
It could be argued, then, that the Court did more than narrow 
the third-party doctrine; it turned the third-party doctrine inside out. 
Not only does the mere fact that a target trusted personal information 
with  a  third  party  no  longer  insulate  that  data  from  Fourth 
Amendment scrutiny, but also the Constitutional duties imposed on 
the  police  might  now  turn  on  the  independent  decisions  of  third 
parties. 
B.  Carpenter and Direct Government Surveillance 
Carpenter’s reasoning should apply even when third parties 
are not involved. Its multi-factor test focuses most of its attention 
on the quality of the database alone, so it should apply even to 
databases compiled directly by the government. It might apply, for 
example, to analyze the use by the police of suspicionless, automated 
data  collection  techniques  such  as  drone  monitoring  or  facial 
recognition techniques used on surveillance camera data.190  
Consider  automated  license  plate  readers.191  These  devices 
contain stationary cameras that sit for days, weeks, or longer on the

  32 side  of  the  road,  deployed  by  government  officials  for  the  express 
purpose of recording the license plate numbers of cars that pass by a 
particular location.192 These records are fed into databases from which 
the police can search for particular vehicles and that are sometimes 
automatically searched to locate stolen or unregistered cars, kidnap 
victims, or missing persons.193  
A simplistic view of Carpenter would assume it had nothing to 
say about ALPRs. Because this technology does not involve private 
parties  doing  the  data  collection,  this  falls  out  of  the  potential 
application of the third-party doctrine.194 Ignoring Carpenter, this case 
might be seen as a fairly straight application of Fourth Amendment 
cases  involving  plain  view,  knowing  exposure,  and  reduced 
expectations of privacy in automobiles.195 This simplistic view would 
suggest that no justification or judicial review is required to collect 
ALPR—much less a search warrant.196 
The  better  reading  is  to  understand  that  Carpenter  has 
rewritten the rules  for assessing the reasonable expectation of privacy 
in massive data gathering efforts, whether or not they are instigated 
by private actors.  
How,  then,  does  ALPR  fare  under  the  Carpenter  factors? 
Because ALPR gives the police the ability to track the location and 
movement of cars, it seems superficially similar to CSLI. But because 
ALPR measures location only at fixed points throughout a city, it is 
likely  to  be  seen  as  less  problematic  than  CSLI  for  many  of  the 
Carpenter  factors.197  ALPR  generates  data  that  is  neither  as  deep, 
broad, nor comprehensive as CSLI.198 Because there is less data, it

  33 collectively  is  less  deeply  revealing  than  CSLI.199  It  is  just  as 
inescapable  and  automatic  as  CSLI,  and  the  efficiency  gain  is 
approximately the same. 
In the end, courts must balance these factors and determine 
whether ALPR implicates privacy enough to qualify as an invasion of a 
reasonable expectation of privacy. It is likely to be a very close call. But 
Carpenter’s reasoning and multi-factor test should apply no less to it, 
even though third parties are not involved. 
C.  The New Rule of Technological Equivalence 
Up to this point, I have focused almost entirely on the rules 
deriving from the majority opinion signed by five justices. Even more 
can be surmised by what the dissents added, because even though they 
disagreed  with  the  majority’s  holding  and  reasoning,  they  provide 
tantalizing concessions suggesting that they too are willing to read the 
Fourth Amendment to cover more police conduct than the Court has 
recognized in the past. Reading all of the Carpenter opinions together 
suggests  a  broad  new  rule  of  technological  equivalence.  Any  police 
activity that is the modern-day equivalent to activity that has been 
long protected under the Fourth Amendment is now protected.200 
The new test relies on a simple syllogism: The Court in the past 
has held that information in a particular, traditional privacy context is 
protected  by  the  Fourth  Amendment.  A  technology  produces 
information  that  is  a  modern-day  equivalent  to  the  information 
produced in the traditional context of step one. The information in the 
modern context is also protected by the Fourth Amendment. 
There are three major strands of this new test in these opinions: 
activity that is technologically equivalent to prying into: the intimacy 
of the home, papers held in bailment, and private communications. 
Consider each in turn. 
1.  Information from Inside the Home 
The  rule  of  technological  equivalence  springs  from  Kyllo,  the 
2001  case  involving  the  use  by  police  of  a  thermal  imaging  device 
pointed at a suburban home in Florence, Oregon.201 To prove that the 
defendant  was  growing  marijuana  inside  his  home,  they  used  the 
device to reveal the heat that emanated from powerful grow lights and 
compared  it  to  the  ordinary  heat  patterns  of  his  neighbors.202  The 
Supreme  Court,  in  an  opinion  by  Justice  Scalia,  held  that  using  a 
thermal imager on a home constituted a Fourth Amendment search.203

202 Id. at 30.  
203 Id. at 34–35. 
  34 Carpenter cites two crucial propositions from Kyllo.204 The first 
is the idea that an inference can be a search.205 The second is the 
proposition that when courts assess the impact of rapidly changing 
technology  under  the  Fourth  Amendment,  it  looks  not  only  at  the 
technology used in the facts of the case, but it extrapolates to future, 
more powerful versions of the technology. “While the technology used 
in the present case was relatively crude, the rule we adopt must take 
account of more sophisticated systems that are already in use or in 
development.”206 
Putting these together, the first rule of technological equivalence 
applies to any information that reveals details from inside a home. The 
centerpiece of Justice Scalia’s reasoning in Kyllo was that “in the home 
. . . all details are intimate details.”207 This kind of reasoning is quite 
likely  to  extend  Fourth  Amendment  protection  to  the  information 
generated  by  many  devices  that  comprise  the  Internet  of  Things, 
because so much of it focuses on the interior of the home.208 Smart 
speakers such as the Amazon Echo and Google Home record sounds 
from  the  inside  of  a  home.209  Smart  TVs  record  the  entertainment 
consumed in a home.210 The Nest thermostat records the temperature 
of the home.211 And the Ring doorbell records visitors to the home.212

  35 The rule of equivalence to the home suggests that the police now 
need a warrant to obtain any of this information. The Kyllo reasoning 
suggests that we need not even consider the sensitivity or intimacy of 
the information obtained, because “all details are intimate details.”213 
Notice that the technological equivalence rule is far simpler and 
more predictable to apply than the majority’s multi-factor test. Once 
the  equivalence  is  made,  the  conduct  is  ruled  a  search,  and  the 
analysis  ends.  One  need  not  endure  the  multi-factor  gymnastics 
required to analyze the status of CSLI. 
Just a few months after Carpenter was decided, the Seventh 
Circuit already applied this rule. In Naperville Smart Meter Awareness 
v. Naperville,214 the court held that a city’s mandatory use of smart 
meters  on  homes  constituted  a  search  under  the  Fourth 
Amendment.215  Because  different  appliances  produce  different  “load 
signatures,” “researchers can predict the appliances that are present in 
a home and when those appliances are used.”216 This “reveals when 
people are home, when people are away, when people sleep and eat, 
what types of appliances are in the home, and when those appliances 
are  used.”217  Although  the  case  cites  Carpenter  in  a  brief  passage 
declining to apply the third-party doctrine, its core reasoning is an 
application  of  the  revitalized  Kyllo.218  This  is  just  the  beginning. 
Carpenter  has  given  Kyllo  new  life.  This  might  turn  out  to  be  as 
profound a legacy of Carpenter as its core reasoning. 
2.  Bailment 
Both Justices Kennedy and Gorsuch lean on the law of bailment, 
suggesting a revitalization of this ancient legal concept by prosecutors 
and  criminal  defense  lawyers.  Consider  Justice  Gorsuch’s  academic 
disquisition on the idea: 
 
[T]he fact that a third party has access to or possession of your 
papers and effects does not necessarily eliminate your interest

footage to law enforcement).

215  The  court  ruled  that  the  search  was  reasonable  because  the  smart  meter 
information was gathered for a non-criminal-investigation government purpose, and 
the benefits of the program outweighed the intrusion on privacy. Naperville Smart

  36 in  them.  Ever  hand  a  private  document  to  a  friend  to  be 
returned? Toss your keys to a valet at a restaurant? Ask your 
neighbor to look after your dog while you travel? You would not 
expect the friend to share the document with others; the valet to 
lend your car to his buddy; or the neighbor to put Fido up for 
adoption.  Entrusting  your  stuff  to  others  is  a bailment.  A 
bailment  is  the  “delivery  of  personal  property  by  one  person 
(the bailor ) to another (the bailee ) who holds the property for a 
certain purpose.” Black's Law Dictionary 169 (10th ed. 2014) . . . 
. A bailee normally owes a legal duty to keep the item safe, 
according to the terms of the parties' contract if they have one, 
and according to the “implication[s] from their conduct” if they 
don't. 8 C.J. S., Bailments § 36, pp. 468–469 (2017). A bailee who 
uses  the  item  in  a  different  way  than  he's  supposed  to,  or 
against the bailor's instructions, is liable for conversion. Id., § 
43, at 481 . . . . These ancient principles may help us address 
modern data cases too. Just because you entrust your data—in 
some  cases,  your  modern-day  papers  and  effects—to  a  third 
party may not mean you lose any Fourth Amendment interest in 
its  contents.  Whatever  may  be  left  of Smith and Miller, few 
doubt that e-mail should be treated much like the traditional 
mail  it  has  largely  supplanted—as  a  bailment  in  which  the 
owner retains a vital and protected legal interest.219 
 
Justice Kennedy, while not engaging with the idea at such length, 
seems to agree that modern-day equivalents to bailment ought not to 
be subject to the third-party doctrine.220 
  This reasoning, by two justices in dissent,221 signals quite clearly 
that the Court will someday rule that “modern-day papers and effects” 
held by third parties will be protected by the Fourth Amendment. This 
seems  to  describe  almost  perfectly  the  contemporary  state  of  cloud 
computing. Services like Google Drive and Dropbox allow individuals 
to  move  their  modern-day  papers  into  the  cloud.222  Services  like

  37 Amazon Web Services create dedicated virtualized computers on cloud 
servers, which customers can fill with data, which other users are not 
permitted  to  access.223  If  law  enforcement  tries  to  obtain  any 
information stored on services such as these, it seems quite likely that 
lower  courts  will  rule  such  accesses  to  be  controlled  by  the 
technological equivalence of bailment rule, thus requiring a warrant. 
3.  Private Communications 
Similarly, all nine justices signed onto opinions that declare that 
the police need a warrant to read the content of email messages.224 
Although this is still merely dicta, it is stated clearly enough so that 
lower courts can and should begin to rely on the clear signal. 
This is important because, to date, only one appellate court, the 
Sixth Circuit, has required the police to obtain a warrant to access the 
content of stored email messages, in the 2010 case United States v. 
Warshak.225 Warshak itself is cited approvingly in Carpenter in three 
separate  opinions:  the  majority,226  and  the  dissents  by  Justices 
Kennedy,227 and Gorsuch.228 
This  is  yet  another  application  of  the  rule  of  technological 
equivalence, the rule of equivalence to private communications. Email 
messages are to modern communications what postal letters were at 
the time of Ex Parte Jackson.229 As the Warshak court said, “[e]mail is 
the technological scion of tangible mail.”230 
More  than  a  bare  majority  of  the  court’s  justices  have  now 
signaled they would hold that the contents of email are protected by 
the Fourth Amendment. The police must obtain a search warrant, or 
proceed  under  an  exception  to  the  warrant  requirement  such  as 
exigent circumstances, to access the contents of email messages. 
It  is  likely  that  this  rule  will  protect  other  forms  of 
technologically abetted communications other than email. Any person-
to-person communications are likely protected. The police most likely 
now need a warrant to obtain, from storage or in real-time, instant

Carpenter  upends  Fourth  Amendment  doctrine.  Its  most 
revolutionary  contribution,  however,  might  be  what  it  has  done  to 
Fourth Amendment reasoning. 
III.  CARPENTER’S TECHNOLOGY EXCEPTIONALISM 
The beating heart of the Carpenter majority opinion is its deep 
and  abiding  belief  in  the  exceptional  nature  of  the  modern 
technological  era.  This  seems  to  come  directly  from  Chief  Justice 
Roberts,  who  revealed  the  same  attitude  four  years  earlier,  in  the 
majority  opinion  in  Riley  v.  California.232  Recent  advances  in 
technology  such  as  the  smartphone  and  the  Internet  have  led  to 
differences in kind and not merely in degree from the technology of the 
past. 
The Chief Justice’s break with the technological past supports a 
break  with  judicial  precedent  in  several  ways.  A  belief  in  the 
exceptionalism of modern technology leads one to dismiss otherwise 
conventional  analogies.  Riley  and  Carpenter  refuse  to  compare 
smartphones to address books, diaries, or even telephones. Because 
analogical  reasoning  sits  at  the  heart  of  legal  reasoning  and  stare 
decisis, the Court’s rejection of analogies like these gives it an opening 
to chart a new path. 
Reasoning  about  exceptional  technology  requires  courts  to 
develop a deep understanding of technology, and these opinions are 
notable for the way they rely heavily on technological explication. They 
are full of citations to amici briefs and they press the boundaries of 
judicial notice. 
Finally,  the  Court’s  tech  exceptionalism  closes  the  door  on 
scholars  who  have  been  trying  to  reinvent  Katz  by  appealing  to 
surveys, history, or positive law. Each of these three approaches peer 
into our past and rely on the ability of lay people to understand what 
has changed. Carpenter and Riley instead look into the future, and for 
that reason, reject all three of these proposals.

Fourth Amendment and rejecting a modern-day equivalent analysis). 
232 Riley v. California, 134 S. Ct. 2473 (2014). 
  39 A.  Rejecting Conventional Analogies 
In Riley, the Chief Justice famously, dismissively said: 
 
The United States asserts that a search of all data stored on a 
cell  phone  is  ‘materially  indistinguishable’  from  searches  of 
these sorts of physical items [such as billfolds, address books, 
purses, and wallets]. That is like saying a ride on horseback is 
materially indistinguishable from a flight to the moon. Both are 
ways of getting from point A to point B, but little else justifies 
lumping them together.233 
 
This is a surprising, wholesale rejection of a conventional analogy: The 
government  urged  the  Court  to  compare  a  digital  technology  to  a 
physical world precursor, and the Court not only refused to do so but 
responded  with  sarcastic  exaggeration.  Understanding  this  quote  is 
the key to understanding both Riley and Carpenter and, more broadly, 
the key to understanding how profoundly these cases have transformed 
the way the Court will reason through Fourth Amendment cases. 
The horseback quote is only the most extreme example of the 
Court refusing to draw an analogy to an ordinary, physical world item 
or activity. The court similarly dispenses with many other traditional 
analogies: a search through a cell phone is not like rifling through a 
diary or pockets;234 the term ‘cell phone’ itself is misleading, because 
these are “minicomputers that also happen to have the capacity to be 
used as a telephone”;235 and accessing CSLI is nothing like tailing a 
car.236 
The Court did embrace some analogies in these opinions, but 
these tended to feel far more fanciful than the ones it rejected, drawn 
essentially from science fiction rather than conventional reality. Cell 
phones  might  be  mistaken  by  aliens  to  be  “features  of  human 
anatomy”;237 tracking CSLI is akin to “attaching an ankle monitor to 
the phone’s user”;238 searching through a cell phone is more invasive 
than searching through a house.239 
Legal scholars have long analyzed the critical role of reasoning 
by analogy to legal reasoning.240 Judges decide cases by determining

(Cambridge, 2005); Cass R. Sunstein, On Analogical Reasoning, 106 HARV. L. REV. 
  40 whether  new  fact  pattern  X  is  similar  to  previously  analyzed  fact 
pattern Y in relevant respects.241 Analogical reasoning gains force in 
legal  reasoning  because  it  is  the  “usual  form  of  reasoning  in  daily 
life.”242 
In Fourth Amendment jurisprudence, analogies play a dominant 
role. Tracking beepers are like following a car on city streets;243 hidden 
microphones are like the human memory;244 and pen registers are like 
human  telephone  operators.245  The  Carpenter  court’s  rejection  of 
conventional analogies is thus a significant development. By refusing 
to  credit  the  government’s  preferred  analogies,  the  Court  could 
distinguish Smith and Miller without needing to overturn the forty-
year-old precedents. 
What Carpenter and Riley have done to analogy and precedent 
might be their most important and lasting revolution. The Court seems 
to be signaling that a foundation stone of legal reasoning—drawing 
comparisons to the ordinary, physical stuff of life—has been rendered 
impermissible. We are all now living in a science fictional universe, at 
least when making arguments to the Court. Why has the Court made 
this move, is it justified, and what does it mean for Fourth Amendment 
law going forward? 
B.  The Chief Justice’s Technology Exceptionalism 
What causes these analogies to fail, in the eyes of the Court, is 
the nature of the technological era in which we are living. The Chief 
Justice  has  declared  in  successive  landmark  decisions  that  the 
information age has produced technological changes that are different 
in kind not merely in degree from the technology of the past.246 He first 
announced  this  worldview,  writing  for  eight  Justices,  in  Riley  v. 
California, which held that the police need a warrant to search the 
contents of a cell phone incident to valid arrest.247 In Carpenter, he

246 E.g., Riley v. California, 134 S. Ct. 2473, 2488 (2014) (“The United States asserts 
that a search of all data stored on a cell phone is ‘materially indistinguishable’ from 
searches of these sorts of physical items. That is like saying a ride on horseback is 
materially indistinguishable from a flight to the moon.”). 
247 Id. 
  41 exhibits  the  same  beliefs,  this  time  to  even  more  consequential 
doctrinal import. 
The Chief Justice writes these opinions with a palpable, wide-
eyed  amazement  at  the  speed  with  which  the  power  and  scale  of 
technology has changed. In Riley, he marvels that in the five short 
years from arrest to Supreme Court ruling, the world had rendered 
obsolete the flip phone used by one of the defendants in the cases being 
reviewed.248 Similarly, in Carpenter he compares with astonishment 
the costly task of tracking a person’s location on foot to the efficiency of 
doing so by downloading their CSLI.249 
He  emphasizes  the  sheer  scale  of  modern  technology.  These 
opinions are replete with mentions of the word “millions”—“millions of 
pages of text;”250 “over a million apps available;”251 “396 million cell 
phone  service  accounts  in  the  United  States—for  a  nation  of  326 
million people”;252 and a database automatically tracking the location 
of “400 million devices”.253 
Some of the words and phrases used in these opinions would 
seem more at home in science fiction than the U.S. Reports. These 
opinions  invoke  time  travel,254  space  travel,255  and  visits  from 
Martians.256 
The Chief Justice is equally impressed with the social dynamics 
of  technological  change,  the  rate  with  which  technology  like  the 
smartphone has been adopted by Americans and has shaped our social 
interactions.  In  both  opinions,  he  cites  statistics  and  surveys 
demonstrating  the  large  percentage  of  Americans  who  use  these 
devices.257 He punctuates both with a statistic that has clearly left a 
lasting  impression:  “12%  [of  smartphone  owners]  admit[]  that  they 
even use their phones in the shower.”258

Do these people simply use their phone next to their shower to listen to audio inside 
the shower, or are they wrapping their device in a waterproof pouch and bringing it 
in with them? The Chief Justice does not say. 
  42 The  Chief  Justice  connects  this  wide-eyed  technology 
exceptionalism into Fourth Amendment doctrine with this key move: 
the “[m]odern cell phone is not just another technological convenience. 
With  all  they  contain  and  all  they  reveal,  they  hold  for  many 
Americans, the privacies of life.”259 Nothing that has come before can 
compare to these devices for the amount and variety of sensitive and 
intimate information about individuals.260 In the passage perhaps most 
bristling  with  Constitutional  import  in  these  opinions,  the  Chief 
Justice declares that a person’s privacy interest in the contents of a 
smartphone is more significant than the privacy interest in a home, 
the ancient, paradigmatic high water mark for privacy.261 
What flows directly from the conclusion that these devices are 
unprecedented vessels for sensitive information is the recognition that 
technology  has  significantly  increased  the  power  of  the  police.262 
Keeping with the science fiction theme, these devices and the records 
they produce essentially transform the police into crime fighting robots 
outfitted  with  superhuman  powers.  They  can  peer  into  the  past, 
avoiding the “frailties of recollection.”263 They can tail every suspect 
“every moment of every day for five years.”264 They are “tireless,”265 
“ever alert, and their memory is nearly infallible.”266 
All  of  this  powerful  rhetoric  about  the  power  of  information 
technology has a profound impact on the reasoning of the court by 
allowing  it  to  discard  analogies  to  what  have  come  before.  For  an 
institution  that  places  historical  continuity,  stare  decisis,  and 
analogical  reasoning  at  its  core,  this  opinion’s  refusal  to  accept 
straightforward analogies is jarring. 
C.  The Argument for Technology Exceptionalism  
The Court’s tech exceptionalism is not science fiction; it is well 
justified.  Changes  in  information  technology  in  recent  years  have 
posed challenges to privacy that are different in kind not merely in 
degree than what has come before. Advances in the past two decades, 
in  particular,  have  dramatically  decreased  the  ability  with  which 
individuals  can  understand,  much  less  control,  the  ways  they  are 
observed and even controlled.

  43 Ryan  Calo  has  written  about  the  tech  exceptionalism  of  our 
time.267 He argues that the field of Cyberlaw is premised on the idea 
that  fundamental  advances  in  technology  such  as  the  Internet  or 
robotics are so qualitatively and quantitatively different from what has 
come  before  that  they  force  changes  in  the  law.268  Specifically,  “a 
technology is exceptional when its introduction into the mainstream 
requires a systematic change to the law or legal institutions in order to 
reproduce, or if necessary displace, an existing balance of values.”269 
This is precisely what the Chief Justice argued that the smartphone 
and CSLI have wrought. 
The  Chief  Justice’s  arguments  are  backed  by  two  decades  of 
scholarly writing. This is perhaps best seen in the output of the annual 
Privacy Law Scholars Conference (PLSC), now in its twelfth year.270 
Authors in this conference have presented almost six hundred articles, 
the  vast  majority  of  which  have  argued  that  specific  changes  in 
technology have threatened information privacy.271 
Articles  presented  at  PLSC  establish  that  technological 
advances increase the quantity and quality of information available to 
third parties.272 They highlight the role inference plays in disrupting 
settled expectations of privacy, because it is no longer enough to look 
at  what  is  literally  in  the  data;273  advances  in  technology  such  as 
machine learning give individuals the power to learn more than what 
is on the surface.274 
PLSC articles have documented how these advances consistently 
thwart expectations and put pressure on social norms.275 A massive 
literature chronicles the harms that these incursions into privacy have 
wrought on individuals, groups, and institutions.276 Many articles have

  44 identified  harms  that  go  beyond  traditional  injury  to  harms  that 
interfere  with  autonomy  and  personal  development.277  Another 
massive  literature  discusses  the  futility  of  self-help  techniques  for 
addressing these risks.278 
It  is  fair  to  say  that  almost  no  scholarly  writing  refutes  the 
argument  that  recent  changes  in  technology  have  put  significant 
pressure  on  privacy  and  privacy  law.  The  very  small  number  of 
detractors or skeptics who write in the field tend to argue instead that 
the  harms  are  either  poorly  supported  by  empirical  support  or 
outweighed by the harm that would be caused by changes to the law.279  
The  Chief  Justice’s  tech  exceptionalism  finds  support  from  a 
significant  body  of  scholarly  argument.  Far  from  being  just  the 
unfounded opinion of a sixty-something jurist,280 tech exceptionalism is 
an argument well within the mainstream of contemporary academic 
writing in information privacy law. 
D.  Expertise and Analogy 
Having  established  that  Chief  Justice  Roberts  views  modern 
technology as exceptional, and having defended this view, how does 
exceptionalism  lead  him  to  disregard  analogy  and  break  with  the 
Court’s  precedents?  How  does  tech  exceptionalism  change  Fourth 
Amendment  jurisprudence?  When  tech  exceptionalism  collides  with 
the legal system, it creates a fundamental problem of expertise. Non-
technical lawyers are simply not trained to explicate the ways in which 
fundamental changes in complex technology put pressure on privacy 
and  increase  government  power.281  They  need  to  seek  help  outside 
experts.  This  is  especially  necessary  when  the  complex  technology

  45 continues to change, presenting not only a complex target of analysis, 
but a moving one.  
This  leaves  the  Court  needing  to  turn  to  unusual  sources  of 
technological  explication.282  Riley  cites  multiple  amici  briefs  for 
detailed, technical details about technology that were never entered 
into  the  lower  court  record.283  It  cites  to  reports  by  government 
agencies  known  for  objective  scientific  expertise.284  It  also  contains 
what is probably the first Supreme Court citation ever to a smartphone 
operating system manual.285 
Carpenter  cites  fewer  external  sources  for  technological  facts 
than Riley, in part because it can cite Riley for some of its facts.286 Still, 
the only citation in the majority opinion to an amici brief is to one 
authored by digital civil rights groups including the Electronic Frontier 
Foundation, which provides critical facts about the improved precision 
of cell tower tracking techniques since the facts of the case.287 
Tech exceptionalism’s expertise problem explains and justifies 
the Court’s rejection of the simplistic, conventional analogies offered by 
the government in Riley and Carpenter, such as the refusal to compare 
a smartphone to an address book.288 In order to make proper sense of 
an analogy comparing an old X to a new Y one must be expert enough 
to understand the relevant similarities and differences between X and 
Y.

(2012)  (“In  rejecting  Fourth  Amendment  claims  involving  warrantless  use  of 
sophisticated technologies, courts often rely upon analogies to prior ‘search’ cases, but 
these supposed analogies are so far removed from the new forms of surveillance that 
analogies to them only confuse, rather than clarify, the actual analysis required by 
Katz.”). 
  46 This  connection  between  analogy  and  expertise  has  been 
explored by legal scholars, to support the argument that lawyers can 
sometimes see analogies that non-lawyers cannot. Frederick Schauer 
and Barbara Spellman offer one account.289 A lawyer sees instantly the 
relevant similarities between “Nazis and civil rights demonstrators of 
the 1960s,” a comparison the non-lawyer might see as “bizarre, even 
offensive.”290  When  viewed  through  the  domain-specific  expertise  of 
First  Amendment  law,  the  similarities  between  groups  wishing  to 
march in public places but opposed by viewpoint-based laws comes into 
view.291 
Tech  exceptionalism  turns  the  tables  on  lawyers,  relegating 
them to the role of the non-experts who cannot understand the failure 
of  a  given  analogy  by  stripping  them  of  their  ability  to  accurately 
characterize Y or to compare it to X.292 Luke Milligan argues that when 
faced  with  complex  technology  in  surveillance  cases,  courts  should 
deploy an “analogy breaker,” rejecting simple analogies in favor of a 
“fresh default analysis.293  
The challenge for criminal lawyers and scholars going forward is 
to grapple with the nuances of technology. The Court now places great 
emphasis on the subtle intricacies of how technology operates, and how 
it differs in important ways from what has come before. We need to 
look to computer scientists and engineers to serve as experts and to 
write legal scholarship, to help guide the way.294 But this is not simply 
a scientific or engineering exercise, because the Court cares also about 
the  sociology  of  technology,  putting  an  impetus  on  new 
interdisciplinary bridges between law and fields such as Science and 
Technology Studies and Human-Computer Interaction.295 
The Court’s new focus on the legitimate and appropriate sources 
of  facts  should  spur  some  modest  institutional  changes.  Both 
prosecutors and defense lawyers now need sophisticated technological

  47 support, either in the form of dedicated technologists or, at the very 
least, hybrid-trained lawyers with some experience in technology. Civil 
liberties groups will need to continue their trend of hiring in-house 
technologists. It is not a coincidence that many of the amici briefs cited 
by the Court were authored by groups focused on digital civil rights 
and  are  well-known  for  hiring  and  associating  with  trained 
technologists.296 
Finally,  this  shift  should  encourage  legal  scholars  who  write 
about the Fourth Amendment and technology to place a premium on 
getting the technological details right. The only law review article cited 
in either majority opinion was authored by Orin Kerr, who not only is a 
preeminent scholar but also one with formal technological training and 
experience;297 and many of the majority’s arguments owe a debt to 
other  uncited  articles,  also  written  by  trained  or  technologically 
sophisticated legal scholars.298 
E.  Time and Technological Change 
The unprecedented, rapidly changing nature of technology also 
causes the Court to relax its rules about restricting its attention to the 
record evidence before it. Traditionally, appellate courts including the 
Supreme Court refuse to peek outside the record developed in the trial 
court. Some of this reticence comes from Article III of the Constitution, 
which limits federal courts to consider only “cases or controversies.”299 
But  it  also  reflects  an  institutional  modesty  that  recognizes  that 
appellate courts are distant from the facts. 
Tech exceptionalism puts pressure on this understanding. The 
premise of tech exceptionalism is that technology changes today at 
unprecedented rates. An appellate court that looks only to the past is 
using the outdated examples in the record to set rules for the present 
and future, which might already differ in important ways. In Carpenter 
and Riley, the Court refuses to resign itself to this fate. Instead, it 
relaxes, just a little, its practices, by peeking a little at the present and 
the future.  
This leads to three new principles of judicial fact-finding: refresh 
what has changed during the pendency of litigation and appeal; relax

  48 the  rules  of  judicial  notice;  and  understand  that  the  future  is 
ascertainable. 
First, the Court in these opinions shows a willingness to refresh 
the record, a little, at each stage of appeal. It takes several years to 
proceed from an arrest, through appeals, to review by the Supreme 
Court.300 Given the rate of change of technology, the passage of time 
means the Court is always reviewing a historical relic in cases like 
these. The Court has responded by seeing fit to peek at the present, 
availing  itself  of  the  kind  of  unusual  sources  of  information  listed 
above, including amici.  
Second,  the  Court  also  seems  willing  to  relax  its  ordinary 
attitudes about taking judicial notice. In Riley, the Court cited the 
iPhone User Guide for the proposition that “modern cell phones can be 
programmed to lock automatically after some period of inactivity,”301 a 
citation  criticized  by  observers.302  This  extra-record  “fact”  was 
introduced to the Court through an amici brief filed by the United 
States in support of the State of California.303 Although the Court does 
not  explicitly  acknowledge  that  it  is  taking  judicial  notice  of  this 
technological fact, this seems to be what it has done.304  
Finally,  the  Court  is  not  afraid  to  look  past  the  facts  of  the 
technology  at  issue  before  it,  to  the  present  and  likely  near-future 
technology that we will soon encounter. The Court implies that the 
future is ascertainable; it is something we can talk about and predict 
with some certainty. In Carpenter, the Court assessed how cell-site 
technology had changed in the intervening seven years.305 In Riley, the 
Court  noted  how  the  flip  phone  at  issue  had  already  “faded  in 
popularity”.306

  49 This sets up a rather stark contrast to what Justice Kennedy 
said (and did) in City of Ontario v. Quon, a 2010 opinion that held that 
a government employer’s review of an employee’s text messages on a 
work pager was reasonable, declining to rule on whether it amounted 
to a search.307 Justice Kennedy cautioned that the Court “risks error 
by  elaborating  too  fully  on  the  Fourth  Amendment  implications  of 
emerging  technology  before  its  role  in  society  has  become  clear.”308 
Carpenter prefers the Kyllo attitude toward predicting the future: we 
“must take account of more sophisticated systems that are already in 
use or in development.”309 Chief Justice Roberts could not disagree 
more fundamentally. 
F.  Refusing to Look Backwards 
The Court decided to look to the future in the face of many 
urging it to look to the past in novel ways. Scholars urged the court to 
base its Fourth Amendment decisions on a close examination of, in 
turn, survey evidence, history, or sources of positive law. The Court 
ignored all of this advice, much to the consternation of the scholars 
involved. 
1.  The Surveyors 
The objective prong of the REP test asks whether an expectation 
of  privacy  is  “one  that  society  is  prepared  to  recognize  as 
reasonable.”310  Some  have  read  the  prong  to  hitch  the  Fourth 
Amendment’s  protections  to  public  sentiment.311  Police  power 
respected the bounds of Constitutional privacy so long as it did not 
stray too far from what ordinary people or average people expect.312 
The  REP  test  should  produce  results  that  follow,  at  least  to  some 
extent,  what  people  actually  expect,  or  so  these  observers  have 
argued.313 
For those who would connect REP to the attitudes of ordinary 
people,  the  next  step  was  to  survey  Americans,  gathering  opinions 
about various police practices, including many fact patterns that have 
already been the subject of Supreme Court case law. This originated 
with landmark work in the late 1990’s by Chris Slobogin and Joseph

  50 Schumacher.314 Through its surveys, the pair concluded that public 
sentiment about the invasiveness of police practice disagreed in many 
instances  with  the  Court’s  Fourth  Amendment  doctrine.315  For 
example, the survey respondents judged “perusing bank records” to be 
the thirty-eighth most invasive activity out of fifty surveyed, roughly 
the  same  as  “hospital  surgery  on  shoulder”,316  contradicting  the 
relative holdings of Miller and Winston v. Lee.317 
The turn to survey work has been revived and invigorated in 
recent  years.318  A  chief  advocate  is  Lior  Strahilevitz,  working  with 
Matthew Kugler.319 Strahilevitz and Kugler have written two articles 
reporting  the  results  of  two  surveys  they  have  conducted.320  The 
authors spend much more time than Slobogin and Schumacher trying 
to lay out a doctrinal and normative case for why judges ought to look 
to  surveys  when  assessing  police  practices.321  They  cite  democratic 
legitimacy,  doctrinal  coherence  and  predictability,  and  the  costs  of 
creating legal rules that ordinary citizens don’t understand or expect 
as the primary justifications.322 
This work follows the broader trend in legal scholarship finding 
new  roles  and  contexts  for  quantitative  social  science.323  Although 
Strahilevitz himself is not directly associated with law and economics, 
he is part of the faculty of the University of Chicago, the cradle of the

  51 discipline. His arguments for incorporating surveys into the Fourth 
Amendment expressly relies on principles from law and economics.324 
These scholars, joined by others who have published surveys 
about privacy attitudes, wrote an amicus brief urging the Carpenter 
Court  to  look  to  the  evidence  they  had  gathered.325  The  brief 
summarizes results showing that very few Americans are aware of the 
ability of cell phone companies to track the location of phones using 
CSLI, supporting an argument for requiring a warrant in the case.326  
The majority opinion failed to cite any of the survey evidence in 
its opinion. The survey work did appear in some of the dissents, albeit 
in support of only minor arguments.327 
Strahilevitz has been among the sharpest critics of the majority 
opinion’s reasoning, if not its result.328 He faults the opinion not just 
for failing to cite survey work but for more broadly refusing to engage 
legal scholarship.329 
2.  The Legal Historians 
One  notable  legal  historian  who  has  focused  on  the  Fourth 
Amendment in recent years is Laura Donohue who has advocated for 
what might be described as an expansive originalism for the Fourth 
Amendment.330  In  her  carefully  researched,  book-length  article, 
Donohue excavates English and colonial law as well as the story of the 
drafting  of  the  Constitution  and  Bill  of  Rights  to  take  on 
misimpressions of Fourth Amendment history.331  
Professor Donohue also authored an amicus brief in Carpenter, 
on behalf of herself and other “scholars of the history and original 
                                            
324 Id. at 227 (advocating a normative framework for the Fourth Amendment that 
“enhance[s] social welfare” and does not spur people to “take excessive precautions to

misalignment  between  the  law  and  social  expectations  is  detrimental  for  both

  52 meaning  of  the  Fourth  Amendment”.332  The  historians  argued  that 
rummaging through CSLI fits the meaning of the word “search” at the 
time of the founding and analogized the search of CSLI as akin to the 
use of general warrants that motivated the Revolution and the drafters 
of the Bill of Rights.333 They noted how the early, celebrated cases of 
Wilkes v. Wood and Entick v. Carrington involved opinions that focused 
on how searches created invasions into privacy and personal affairs.334 
Among the other signers of the historians’ brief was William Cuddihy, 
author of a well-cited, exhaustive history of the Fourth Amendment.335 
The majority opinion engages in almost no historical analysis, 
beyond an obligatory acknowledgement of the role the opposition to 
general  warrants  and  writs  of  assistance  played  in  sparking  the 
American  Revolution.336  Justices  Thomas  and  Gorsuch  engaged  the 
history much more deeply in their respective dissents. Only Justice 
Thomas  cites  the  work  of  legal  historians,  including  Donohue  and 
Cuddihy,  while  using  the  history  to  conclude  that  no  search  had 
occurred in this case, the opposite conclusion the historians pressed in 
their brief.337 
3.  The Positive Law Proponents 
Finally, much attention has been paid to a recent law review 
article by William  Baude and James Stern.338 The authors propose a 
dramatically simplified question to replace the REP: “have [officials] 
engaged in an investigative act that would be unlawful for a similarly 
situated private actor to perform”?339 If yes, a search has occurred; if 
not, no search has occurred.340 The sources of illegality would include 
property law—thus bearing some resemblance to Justice Scalia’s rule 
in  Jones—but  would  go  beyond  to  include  “any  prohibitory  legal 
provisions,  whether  legislative,  judicial,  or  administrative  in  origin, 
and whether classified as criminal or civil in nature.”341

because “[i]t is conceptually clear, theoretically sound, less subjective, 
more  legal,  and  responsive  both  to  social  fact  and  technological 
change.”342  They  connect  the  proposal  to  historical  references  to 
positive law in critiques of British search and seizure practice; the 
structural advantages of making Fourth Amendment law act similarly 
to Fifth Amendment takings jurisprudence; and the idea that judging 
the police by the same laws that govern us all contributes to the rule of 
law.343  Finally,  they  point  to  practical  advantages,  touting  that  it 
betters the REP test by being clearer, equally adaptable, and more 
respectful of the role of the legislature.344  
Neither  Baude  nor  Stern  signed  an  amicus  brief,  but  their 
article  was  cited  in  the  Petitioner’s  opening  brief.345  Although  the 
majority opinion failed to cite the article, it was cited in the dissents by 
both Justices Thomas and Gorsuch.346 
4.  Looking Forwards Not Backwards 
The majority’s refusal to embrace surveys, legal history, or the 
positive law when applying the Fourth Amendment to new technology 
should  be  seen  as  an  affirmative  rejection  by  five  justices  of  these 
proposals, not indifference nor an oversight. The reason, once again, is 
tech  exceptionalism.  Seen  through  this  lens,  approaches  that  look 
backward in time, like these three, do not serve a useful purpose, for 
the focus should turn to the present and future. This is not to say that 
history, surveys, and positive law will never again figure into Fourth 
Amendment cases involving advances in information technology. But 
for now, the Court has turned its back on them. 
Most directly, history seems the wrong tool for reasoning about 
these  questions.  Given  the  significant  differences  between  CSLI 
tracking  and  the  location  tracking  of  a  few  decades  ago,  it  seems 
especially unhelpful to wonder what the Framers would have thought 
about CSLI. 
  In Riley and Carpenter, history is invoked, but briefly and in 
passing. History seems useful to the modern Fourth Amendment only 
held at a distance and as a source of very general analogy. “The fact 
that technology now allows an individual to carry [a cell phone’s worth 
of] information in his hand does not make the information any less

  54 worthy  of  the  protection  for  which  the  Founders  fought.”347  The 
suggestion is that searching a cell phone is akin to “the reviled ‘general 
warrants’ and ‘writs of assistance’ of the colonial era.”348 
  The  Fourth  Amendment  is  “informed  by  historical 
understandings  ‘of  what  was  deemed  an  unreasonable  search  and 
seizure [when the Fourth Amendment] was adopted.”349 It is meant to 
“secure ‘the privacies of life’ against ‘arbitrary power’” and “a central 
aim  of  the  Framers  was  ‘to  place  obstacles  in  the  way  of  a  too 
permeating police surveillance’”.350 These quoted passages are the sum 
total  of  the  Court’s  attention  to  history  in  these  two  landmark 
opinions, a far cry from what the historians had hoped to see. 
The problem with survey results in an era of tech exceptionalism 
is that lay attitudes about rapidly changing technology are likely to be 
rapidly changing, unstable, and uninformed. It’s one thing to look at 
survey results to ask whether Americans think the police ought to be 
able to hide a recording device on a confidential informant. Average 
Americans have had nearly a century to understand voice recording 
and  millennia  to  have  developed  fixed  opinions  about  misplaced 
confidences.351  This  seems  like  the  kind  of  technology-aided 
surveillance that a court might rely on a survey to assess. But asking 
average  Americans  to  opine  about  cell-site  location  information  or 
facial  recognition  or  smart  meters  is  simply  not  likely  to  produce 
informed opinions.352 At best, it will reflect still developing attitudes 
about  misunderstood  and  changing  technologies.  To  be  fair, 
Strahilevitz suggests something similar in his work.353 Why we would 
hitch our Constitutionally bestowed civil liberties to the quicksand of 
the median American’s technology literacy defies common sense. 
The situation for the positive law is even worse. It compounds 
the  confusion  the  general  public  has  about  the  social  meaning  of 
rapidly  changing  technology  with  the  vagaries  of  the  sclerotic 
legislative  and  judicial  processes.354  This  is  especially  true  when

technology.355 The situation has become much worse in recent years, as 
technology  companies  have  discovered  Washington  and  today 
represent  an  industry  that  spends  some  of  the  most  lobbying 
Congress.356 
To  put  it  succinctly,  applying  the  Fourth  Amendment  to 
information technology requires the Court to look forward; all three of 
the proposed approaches look backward instead. 
IV.  CARPENTER AS A REPLACEMENT FOR KATZ 
The  conventional  wisdom  suggests  that  Carpenter  is  an 
application or expansion of the Katz REP test. We might think of it 
instead as an outright replacement for REP, at least for cases involving 
complex modern technology. 
Carpenter settles long-standing disputes about both prongs of 
the Katz test. It affirms the conclusion that “Katz has only one step,”357 
providing  no  analysis  whatsoever  into  the  defendant’s  subjective 
expectation of privacy. For the objective prong, Carpenter means that 
the Court has at long last answered the fundamental question about 
REP:  does  the  objective  prong  merely  describe  the  expectations  of 
ordinary Americans or does it ask judges to propound a normative 
vision  for  the  kind  of  society  the  Constitution  seeks  to  protect? 
Carpenter  selects  the  normative  over  the  descriptive:  given  tech 
exceptionalism, the role for courts is to protect the balance of power 
between the state (in the form of the police) and the people, refusing to 
let  technological  change  eviscerate  individual  privacy  and  security 
from the state. 
These changes do more than apply or extend Katz, they reinvent 
and supplant that venerable opinion. The REP test has been replaced 
by  Carpenter’s  multi-factor  test  and  the  rule  of  technological 
equivalence. Time will reveal that the Katz era has ended. This is a 
welcome  development;  the  Carpenter  era  will  be  seen  as  more 
predictable, Constitutionally supported, and responsive to the rate of 
change of technology than the REP test it has replaced.

357 Orin S. Kerr, Katz Has Only One Step: The Irrelevance of Subjective Expectations, 
82 U. CHI. L. REV. 113, 113 (2015) [hereinafter Kerr, One Step]. 
  56 A.  The Subjective Prong: Katz has Only One Step 
Carpenter supports what Orin Kerr has argued: “the subjective 
prong [of the REP test] has become a phantom doctrine.”358 As initially 
expressed in Justice Harlan’s concurrence, the REP test was a two-
pronged  inquiry:  “first  that  a  person  have  exhibited  an  actual 
(subjective) expectation of privacy and, second, that the expectation be 
one that society is prepared to recognize as ‘reasonable.’”359 
Scholars have offered at least three different interpretations for 
the subjective prong, none of which appear in Carpenter. Most often, 
Courts seem to treat the subjective test as an inquiry into what the 
person  actually  intended  in  her  mind.360  Did  this  person  actually 
believe her actions or communications were shielded from public view? 
The problem with this formulation is that it never seems to matter. 
Almost never is the Court confronted with a situation in which this 
version of the subjective prong fails but the objective prong does not. 
Kerr argues that the subjective prong could instead have been 
read, long ago, to place more emphasis on Justice Harlan’s use of the 
word “exhibited.”361 By this reading, the subjective prong asks whether 
the  defendant  had  “voluntarily  exposed”  information  to  the  public. 
Critically, this version of the test would not require courts to probe the 
inner mind of the person asserting privacy. Rather, it would look to the 
objective measures the person took to block the government’s view.362 
A third way of interpreting the subjective prong is offered by 
Lior  Strahilevitz  and  Matthew  Kugler.363  They  argue  that  courts 
should consult survey evidence in the subjective prong, “us[ing] the 
sentiments  of  the  median  American  citizen  as  a  proxy  for  the 
defendant’s subjective expectation of privacy.”364  
We  do  not  know  how  the  Carpenter  Court  interpreted  the 
subjective  prong,  because  the  majority’s  opinion  gives  it  almost  no 
attention.  The  opinion  never  mentions  the  word  “subjective.”  Its 
recitation  of  the  REP  test  barely  nods  at  this  as  a  separate 
requirement:  An  REP  is  “[w]hen  an  individual  “seeks  to  preserve 
something  as  private,”  and  his  expectation  of  privacy  is  “one  that 
society is prepared to recognize as reasonable . . . .”365 In applying the 
test, the Court makes no attempt to analyze subjective and objective 
expectations separately.

  57 Carpenter did not put a nail in the coffin of the subjective prong, 
because it was interred six feet under long ago.366 The subjective prong 
has become an unmarked grave, one courts trample from above, not 
even  acknowledging  the  presence  of  the  decomposed  remains 
underfoot. 
B.  The Objective Prong: Victory of the Normative Fourth 
Amendment 
By  recognizing  tech  exceptionalism,  the  Carpenter  court 
restores—at  least  for  the  time  being—the  normative  vision  of  the 
Fourth Amendment, taking sides in a very old debate: is the objective 
prong of the REP test—which asks, is society prepared to accept an 
expectation  of  privacy  as  reasonable—a  descriptive  or  normative 
inquiry?367  Is  it  the  judge’s  role  to  examine  what  the  reasonable 
individual or median member of society expects, or is it the judge’s 
charge  to  imagine  how  its  rulings  can  help  set  our  society  onto  a 
particular path?368 
Justice Harlan, who first conceived of the reasonable expectation 
of privacy test, made his opinion about this question quite clear only 
four years after Katz, albeit in dissent:  
 
Since it is the task of the law to form and project, as well as 
mirror and reflect, we should not, as judges, merely recite the 
expectations  and  risks  without  examining  the  desirability  of 
saddling them upon society. The critical question, therefore, is 
whether under our system of government, as reflected in the 
Constitution, we should impose on our citizens the risks of the 
electronic listener or observer without at least the protection of a 
warrant requirement.369 
 
Too often, the Court has strayed from this path, thinking of its role in 
interpreting REP as merely descriptive.370

  58 Carpenter  advances  the  idea  that,  at  least  when  technology 
changes rapidly, the proper role for the court is the normative one 
Justice Harlan advocated. We should not “saddle” society with merely 
what it has come to expect.371 
Technology exceptionalism once again settles this question. The 
proper  accounting  of  the  way  technology  has  disrupted  individual 
privacy, distorted society, and rebalanced the power between the state 
and  its  citizens  thrusts  the  judiciary  into  a  more  aggressive  role 
interpreting the Fourth Amendment than it has assumed in the past.  
This,  once  again,  is  at  the  heart  of  Orin  Kerr’s  equilibrium 
adjustment theory and Bankston and Soltani’s theory of government 
efficiency gain.372 The Constitution is premised on an ordinary rate of 
change in the balance of power between the state and the people. The 
Fourth Amendment is our national thermostat, recalibrating what the 
police can and cannot do. In periods of ordinary technological change—
which  describes  the  first  two  hundred  years  or  so  of  our  national 
experience—we could afford a merely descriptive Fourth Amendment, 
trusting our institutions to respond to change. But when faced with 
moments  of  disruptive  technological  restructuring  of  power  and 
institutions,  the  normative  Fourth  Amendment—and  the  court’s 
central role in protecting it—becomes an imperative. 
C.  The Argument for Moving Beyond Katz 
Once we recognize that Carpenter has moved beyond Katz in 
important ways, we should ask whether this is a desirable result. I 
contend that the future sketched out by Carpenter is to be preferred 
than the world Katz has given us. 
First,  Carpenter’s  multi-factor  test  will  lead  to  more 
predictability than Katz. The REP test has always been open-textured 
and ambiguous. What is a reasonable expectation of privacy? Is the 
objective prong to be analyzed descriptively or normatively? 
Ambiguous  at  birth,  the  subsequent  decades  have  done  very 
little  to  lend  Katz  concreteness  or  predictability.  Orin  Kerr 
persuasively argues that the Court chooses from among a menu of four 
different  approaches—private  facts,  probabilistic,  positive  law,  and 
                                                                                                                       
petitioner voluntarily conveyed numerical information to the telephone company and 
“exposed” that information to its equipment in the ordinary course of business. In so 
doing, petitioner assumed the risk that the company would reveal to police the 
numbers he dialed.”).

  59 policy—to assess REP.373 But it is hard to discern a pattern to when 
the Court chooses each.374 
In contrast, the multi-factor test is relatively easy to apply. As 
the examples in Part I demonstrate, there will be disagreement about 
how  to  apply,  say,  the  “depth,  breadth,  and  comprehensive  reach” 
factor to different databases. But the spectrum of disagreement will be 
narrow  and  cabined  compared  to  wide  ranging  across  Kerr’s  four 
models that Katz has created.375 Carpenter sweeps away the cacophony 
of the four models, selecting a normative over descriptive methodology 
with four concrete factors. 
Second, the approach is, if anything, more closely connected to 
the text and history of the Constitution. To be clear, neither Katz nor 
Carpenter purports to adhere closely to the text and history. But Katz 
suffered by focusing on a principle—privacy—that is nowhere to be 
seen on the literal text of the amendment. 
In contrast, Carpenter’s test and reasoning resonate much more 
directly with the history. The Court treats the Fourth Amendment as 
primarily a restriction on government power, not just a protection of 
privacy.376 The factors hone in on the features of data that fuel the 
government’s power. “Comprehensive reach” allows the government to 
conduct surveillance on the entire populace; “breadth” allows it to peer 
back in time; “depth” and “deeply revealing nature” raise the prospect 
of meaningful harm. 
In addition, the location information in Carpenter and the smart 
phone in Riley are arguably intrinsic aspects of individual personality, 
connecting them to the “persons” recited in the text of the opinion. 
Third, the technological exceptionalism at the heart of the new 
test impels courts to consider deeply the specific features of technology, 
and society’s embrace of technology, that was usually lacking from the 
conventional REP test. This will prevent the kind of indifference to 
progress that plagued the third-party doctrine from its birth. 
  CONCLUSION 
Based on the new rule it announces, Carpenter is already on par 
with some of the most consequential Fourth Amendment cases of all 
time. But when one looks beyond the core rule to some of the other

  60 revolutions  wrought  in  the  opinion,  one  is  left  to  conclude  that 
Carpenter represents a fundamental shift, not merely an incremental 
adaptation.  Carpenter  turns  the  third-party  doctrine  inside-out, 
eroding the requirement of government action as a core underpinning 
of the Fourth Amendment; it applies even when the government acts 
directly  to  collect  information  about  many  individuals  in  massive 
databases;  it  implicitly  suggests  three  new  rules  of  technological 
equivalence; it embraces a technological exceptionalism that permits a 
break  from  judicial  precedent;  and  it  begins  the  overdue  project  of 
replacing the Katz REP test. 
On December 19, 1967, the day after the Court decided Katz, it 
probably was not yet clear what the Court had done.377 The decision 
was rightly seen as important, the culmination of almost forty years of 
scholarly commentary against the narrow trespass theory reasoning of 
Olmstead v. United States.378 What might have been seen at first as 
merely an important decision only later was rightfully recognized for 
the many revolutions it created. 
What  Katz  did  to  Olmstead,  Carpenter  will  do  to  Katz, 
transforming the Fourth Amendment into something fundamentally 
new. The Fourth Amendment has become the vessel for a civil right 
that, for the first time, responds flexibly and rapidly to the insistent 
challenges of new technology on privacy.
