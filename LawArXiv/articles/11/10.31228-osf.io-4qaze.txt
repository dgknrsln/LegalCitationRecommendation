TAX REFORM DISCOURSE 
Anthony C. Infanti∗ 
“Any measure that values a gun several hundred times more than a 
bottle of milk is bound to raise serious questions about its relevance for 
human progress. It is no surprise, then, that since the emergence of 
national income accounts, there has been considerable dissatisfaction 
with gross  national product as a measure of  human welfare. GNP 
reflects market prices in monetary terms. Those prices quietly register 
the prevailing economic and purchasing power in the system—but they 
are  silent  about  the  distribution,  character  or  quality  of  economic 
growth. GNP also leaves out all activities that are not monetized—
household work, subsistence agriculture, unpaid services. And what is 
more serious, GNP is one-dimensional: it fails to capture the cultural, 
social, political and many other choices that people make.”

I.  INTRODUCTION 
Tax  reform  equals  economic  growth.  This  simple  equation 
captures both the essence of, and the essential problem with, recent 
debates  over  tax  reform.2  As  the  Organisation  for  Economic  Co-
 
  2  My primary focus in this article is on U.S. domestic tax reform debates, even 
though the obsession with pro-growth tax reform is by no means a uniquely American 
phenomenon. See infra Part II.B. For an interesting discussion of the troubling aspects 
of the tax reform discourse regarding so-called developing or transition countries, see 
Miranda Stewart, Global Trajectories of Tax Reform: The Discourse of Tax Reform in 
Developing and Transition Countries, 44 HARV. INT’L L.J. 139 (2003). INFANTI.FINAL.DOC  10/23/2012  6:03 PM

operation  and  Development  (OECD)  has  succinctly  stated,  “[t]ax 
systems are primarily aimed at financing public expenditures.”3 Or, in 
the  words  of  President  Bush’s  Advisory  Panel  on  Federal  Tax 
Reform, “[T]he interests of a few should not stand in the way of the 
tax code’s primary goal: to raise funds efficiently for the common 
defense, vital social programs, and other goals of shared purpose.”4 
Yet, debates over reforming our tax system tend to focus not on the 
public  good  —  that  is,  on  advancing  human  development  —  but 
narrowly on facilitating economic growth. In this article, I propose 
shifting the tax reform discourse away from a nearly unwavering focus 
on economic growth toward a broader focus on people, and, more 
particularly, on those in our society who are disadvantaged.5 
Economic growth can be important to human development, but it 
is  far  from  all  that  there  is  to  development.6  Indeed,  economists 
Anthony Atkinson, Thomas Piketty, and Emmanuel Saez have shown 
how recent periods of economic growth have redounded primarily to 
the benefit of the privileged few at the top of the income scale. In a 
comparative study using income tax data, they have shown that the 
share of income going to the top ten percent of the population in the 
United States experienced a precipitous decline during World War II, 
leveled off in the postwar decades, and significantly spiked beginning 
in the 1970s.7 The share of total income going to the top ten percent 
reached nearly fifty percent by 2007, which is “the highest level on

  5  I use the term “disadvantaged” here in a broad sense. It is meant to capture 
the disadvantage experienced by traditionally subordinated groups, including women, 
racial and ethnic minorities, sexual minorities, the poor, and those with physical 
disabilities. It is also meant to capture other groups — for example, undocumented 
immigrants  and  those  in  rural  communities  —  who  experience  comparative 
disadvantage in terms of their sharing in the overall human development that we 
experience as a society.

substantial achievements are possible even without fast growth.”).

Long Run of History, 49 J. ECON. LITERATURE 3, 6 (2011). INFANTI.FINAL.DOC  10/23/2012  6:03 PM

record.”8 Most of this change benefited the top one percent, which 
saw its share of income increase “from 8.9 percent in 1976 to 23.5 
percent in 2007.”9 The top 0.1% has done even better, with its share of 
income  having  “more  than  quadrupled  from  2.6  percent  to  12.3 
percent over this period.”10 As a result, “the top 1 percent captured 58 
percent of real economic growth” during this period.11 
The picture becomes even more striking when one focuses on 
Saez and Piketty’s work regarding the two most recent periods of 
economic growth (i.e., 1993–2000 and 2002–2007). During the period 
from 1993–2008, the “top 1 percent incomes captured slightly more 
than half of the overall economic growth.”12 During the period from 
2002–2007,  “the  top  1  percent  captured  two  thirds  of  income 
growth.”13 As expected, the top one percent saw its share of income 
drop during the recession — from 23% in 2007 to 17% in 2009.14 
Importantly, however, according to Saez: 
[T]he Great Recession is unlikely to have a very large impact 
on top income shares and will certainly not undo much of the 
dramatic increase in top income shares that has taken place 
since the 1970s. . . . [B]ased on the US historical record, falls 
in  income  concentration  due  to  economic  downturns  are 
temporary unless drastic regulation and tax policy changes 
are  implemented  and  prevent  income  concentration  from 
bouncing back.15 
In fact, in 2010, the top one percent saw its share of income “gr[o]w by

11.6% while bottom 99% incomes grew only by 0.2%.”16 In other 
words, “the top 1% captured 93% of the income gains in the first year 
of recovery.”17 
The Congressional Budget Office reached similar conclusions in a 
study of the distribution of household income from 1979 to 2007.18 
Additionally, in the context of a broader study of inequality across its 
member countries,19 the OECD observed that “[t]he United States is 
the country with the highest inequality level and poverty rate across 
the  OECD,  Mexico  and  Turkey  excepted.”20  The  OECD  further 
noted that, in the United States, “[t]he average income of the richest 
10%  is . . .  in  purchasing  power  parities,  the  highest  level  in  the 
OECD.  However,  the  poorest  10%  of  the  US  citizens  have  an 
income . . . about 20% lower than the average for OECD countries.”21 
As Saez has asserted, the results of such studies “may help explain 
the disconnect between the economic experiences of the public and 
the solid macroeconomic growth posted by the U.S. economy from 
2002 to 2007”22 as well as “the recent public demonstrations against

  22  Saez, supra note 12, at 3. Atkinson, Saez, and Piketty put this in perspective 
by comparing the growth in U.S. income over this time period with the growth in 
income in France over the same period: 
[A]verage real incomes per family in the United States grew by 32.2 percent 
from 1975 to 2006 while they grew only by 27.1 percent in France during the 
same  period . . .  showing  that  the  macroeconomic  performance  in  the 
United States was better than the French one during this period. Excluding 
the top percentile, average U.S. real incomes grew only 17.9 percent during 
the  period  while  average  French  real  incomes—excluding  the  top 
percentile—still grew at much the same rate (26.4 percent) as for the whole 
French population. Therefore, the better macroeconomic performance of 
the United States versus France is reversed when excluding the top 1 
percent.

inequality.”23 The results of these studies have also set off alarm bells 
in some quarters, leading to calls for reform that encourages “broad-
based”  economic  growth.24  But  achieving  broad-based  economic 
growth is no panacea because human development is about much 
more  than  just  increasing  incomes  and  economic  growth.25  Put 
differently, even under the best of conditions, economic growth is an 
impoverished  proxy  for  human  development.  Under  current 
conditions, its value as a proxy for human development has been 
completely spent. The time has come to shift the focus of tax reform 
debates toward advancing human development — with a special focus 
on aiding those who are disadvantaged in our society — and away 
from further entrenching the privilege of a wealthy few. 
The remainder of this article is divided into four parts. Part II 
illustrates how tax reform debates in the United States (and abroad) 
have come to revolve around spurring economic growth. Part III then 
draws on the development literature to show how there is far more to 
human  development  than  just  economic  growth.  By  tracing  the 
journey in this literature away from an unbending focus on economic 
growth  toward  broader  notions  (and  measures)  of  human 
development, Part III directly undermines the equation of tax reform 
with efforts to stimulate economic growth. Having broken the link 
between  tax  reform  and  economic  growth,  Part  IV  then  turns  to 
considering how the tax reform debate might change if the unbending 
focus on economic growth were replaced with a broader focus on 
advancing human development. In particular, and keeping in mind the

lessons learned from the development literature, Part IV considers the 
impact  of  such  a  shift  on  the  debate  about  eliminating  tax 
expenditures — that is, the tax “loopholes” that always seem to be in 
the  crosshairs  of  tax  reformers.  Part  V  provides  brief  concluding 
remarks. 
II.  THE MANTRA OF ECONOMIC GROWTH 
In the introduction to their book Fundamental Tax Reform, John 
Diamond and George Zodrow observe: 
The current tax reform discussion in the United States and 
around the world differs to some extent from earlier debates 
on tax reform, in that much of the current interest in changing 
the tax structure focuses on improving the tax climate for 
business in order to stimulate additional saving, investment, 
employment, wages, and economic growth.26 
A few examples will help to underscore Diamond and Zodrow’s 
point. To this end, the first section of this Part includes several recent 
examples from the United States that illustrate how economic growth 
has become the buzzword of our tax reform debates. The second 
section of this Part provides a few brief examples illustrating how the 
idea that tax reform should be used to stimulate economic growth has 
spread beyond the United States, especially in the wake of the global 
financial and economic crisis. 
A.  The American Experience 
In 2005, President George W. Bush’s Advisory Panel on Federal 
Tax Reform issued its report. Three principles typically guide any tax 
policy inquiry: (1) efficiency, (2) equity, and (3) administrability. In 
other words, when formulating tax policy, we usually “strive for a tax 
system that (1) minimizes interference with economic decisionmaking 
[sic], (2) is fair, and (3) is easy to administer and comply with.”27 
Echoing the executive order establishing the panel,28 the title of the 
panel’s  report  —  Simple,  Fair,  and  Pro-Growth:  Proposals  to  Fix 
America’s Tax System — repeats these three principles, but with one

significant modification. Rather than striving for a tax system that 
refrains from tinkering with economic decision making to the greatest 
extent possible, the panel (and President Bush) saw its purpose as 
tilting the economic playing field to encourage “growth.” In fact, one 
of the two reform proposals put forward by the panel was labeled the 
“Growth  and  Investment  Tax  Plan.”29  After  all,  as  the  panel 
counterfactually contended,30 “[g]reater economic growth should . . . 
benefit all Americans.”31 
For instance, the panel made a number of recommendations that 
were intended to create strong incentives for taxpayers to save or 
make  investments,  rather  than  to  consume  now.32  It  also 
recommended  that  small  businesses  be  permitted  to  immediately 
expense most asset purchases in order to “encourage new investment 
and  capital  formation  by  growing  businesses.”33  Such  generous 
expensing (e.g., the “bonus” depreciation provision in § 168(k)) has 
been criticized in the past for encouraging investment in capital at the 
expense  of  investment  in  labor  (i.e.,  hiring),  leading  to  jobless 
economic recoveries following economic downturns.34 Perhaps more 
astonishingly, the panel made this recommendation despite its own 
deprecation of the inefficiencies created by our extant depreciation 
system,  which  favors  investments  in  certain  types  of  assets  over 
others.35 Thus, far from removing the tax “thumb” from the scales, 
these examples illustrate tax reform proposals that either move the 
tax “thumb” from one side of the scales to the other or place an even 
heavier weight on one side over the other. 
Similarly, a few years later, Professor Michael Graetz put forward 
his own tax reform plan.36 As the centerpiece of his plan, Professor

2012]  Tax Reform Discourse  213 
Graetz suggested scaling back the income tax, so that it applies only to 
those with higher incomes, and enacting a value-added tax to make up 
for the loss in revenue.37 In the third paragraph of his book making the 
case  for  this  proposal,  Professor  Graetz  wrote  the  following 
illuminating passage: 
The  time  for  fundamental  reform  has  come.  In  a  world 
immeasurably  more  interdependent  than  the  world  of  the 
mid-twentieth century, when our current system of taxation 
took shape, a vital question for any reform proposal is: Will it 
make American workers and businesses more competitive in 
the  global  economy,  while  maintaining  the  progressive 
structure consistent with our nation’s historical insistence on 
fairness? The proposal I offer in this book—what I will call 
the Competitive Tax—does just that.38 
Despite acknowledging the importance of a “progressive structure” to 
our tax system,39 Professor Graetz’s primary focus is on enhancing 
competitiveness. This is clear both from his phrasing of the “vital 
question”  and  from  the  fact  that  he  denominates  his  plan  the 
“Competitive Tax” rather than the “Competitive and Fair Tax” or the 
“Fair and Competitive Tax” or even the “Fair Competitive Tax.” 
When  he  later  opens  his  discussion  of  “[f]irst  [p]rinciples  of 
[r]esponsible [r]eform,”40 Professor Graetz describes the “traditional 
goals of tax reform” as follows: “produce adequate revenue; promote 
economic  growth;  increase  international  competitiveness  of  U.S. 
products, workers, and businesses; minimize interference with private 
 
AND COMPETITIVE TAX PLAN FOR THE UNITED STATES (2008). 
  37  For a summary of Professor Graetz’s plan, see id. at 197–213. 
  38  Id. at 4; see also id. at 16 (“We need a tax system that will encourage 
investment in the United States to create good jobs and will help make the goods and 
services our businesses and workers produce more affordable to consumers around 
the world.”). 
  39  To achieve a “progressive structure” in his Competitive Tax, Professor Graetz 
retains the income tax on higher-income earners and proposes either a “payroll 
adjustment” targeted at lower-income earners or the distribution of “‘smart’ cards 
that would be scanned by retailers to eliminate VAT on either a specified amount of 
purchases or on purchases of specific goods and services.” Id. at 170–71, 178; see id. at 
170–81 (explaining both possibilities). 
Professor Graetz’s choice of words here is quite intriguing because there is a 
difference between a tax system with a “progressive structure” and a tax system that 
actually operates in a progressive fashion. Infanti, supra note 27, at 1251–52.

decision  making;  streamline  compliance  and  administration;  and, 
finally, distribute the burden of taxation fairly in accordance with 
people’s ability to pay.”41 In this litany of principles, setting aside the 
obvious goal of producing revenue, Professor Graetz first mentions 
economic growth and next increasing competitiveness. He only then 
reiterates the three principles that typically guide tax policy inquiries, 
mentioning  the  efficiency  or  neutrality  of  the  tax  system  first, 
simplification second, and fairness last of all. Again, the primary focus 
is on economic growth. 
More recently, the topic of tax reform has surfaced in connection 
with  discussions  of  deficit  reduction.  The  need  for  tax  reform  to 
increase or enhance the nation’s economic growth often surfaces in 
these discussions. For example, Erskine Bowles and Alan Simpson, 
co-chairmen of the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and 
Reform,  penned  an  op-ed  piece  in  The  New  York  Times  on  the 
summer 2011 deal to increase the debt ceiling, in which they stated: 
And we must address the tax code. We need new revenue to 
finance the increasing costs of our health care system and an 
aging  population  —  but  it  should  come  from  reducing  or 
eliminating tax breaks, not from higher rates. The tax code is 
riddled with annual tax breaks amounting to $1 trillion — 
most of which are just government spending in disguise. By 
reforming them, we can reduce individual and corporate tax 
rates  in  a  way  that  keeps  the  tax  code  progressive  while 
promoting economic growth and reducing the deficit at the 
same time.42 
In an op-ed piece published in The Wall Street Journal in the wake of 
the  debt-ceiling  debate,  Kevin  Warsh,  a  former  Governor  of  the 
Federal  Reserve,  and  Jeb  Bush,  former  Governor  of  Florida, 
suggested that the nation’s “economic grand strategy” should be, “[i]n 
a word: growth.”43 They explained that: 
An  effective  growth  strategy  confronts  tough  challenges 
before they become intractable. The strategy is a threat to 
those who take refuge in our burdensome tax code, and it is a

great source of encouragement to those who seek higher rates 
of return on physical and human capital. Hence, fundamental 
tax reform—dramatically lowering tax rates for individuals 
and companies while eliminating loopholes, deductions and 
credits—is critical to economic growth.44 
In an op-ed piece published in The Washington Post to explain and 
“sell” the agreement reached to end the showdown over raising the 
debt ceiling, Timothy Geithner, the Secretary of the Treasury, wrote 
that “[t]he agreement sets up a powerful mechanism for agreement on 
tax reforms to strengthen growth.”45 Similarly, Pennsylvania Senator 
Pat  Toomey,  one  of  the  members  of  the  congressional  “super 
committee” created as part of this agreement, reportedly stated that 
“his ‘guiding principles’ on the committee will be ‘the twin goals of 
reducing the deficit and continuing to promote economic growth.’ To 
that end, he hopes to reform the tax code in order to broaden the base 
while lowering rates and growing the economy.”46 Moreover, John 
Boehner, Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, urged the 
super committee to tackle tax reform in an effort to “improve the 
environment for economic growth.”47 Similarly, a group of thirty-six 
senators (including all but one member of the so-called Gang of Six) 
called on the super committee to “‘focus on the major parts of the 
budget and include long-term entitlement reforms and pro-growth tax 
reform.’”48 
B.  International Experience 
This focus on tax reform as a potential driver of economic growth 
is by no means a uniquely American phenomenon, especially with the 
advent of the global financial and economic crisis. For instance, in 
2010, the OECD issued a report aptly titled Tax Policy Reform and 
Economic Growth.49 In this report, the OECD investigated what it 
described as a “key issue for tax policy making”; namely, “how tax

structures could best be designed to promote economic growth.”50 
Notwithstanding  an  acknowledgment  that  tax  systems  are  used  to 
achieve objectives other than economic growth, the OECD generally 
ignored these other objectives in preparing its report, “except when 
there is a clear trade off between them and tax reforms aimed at 
raising GDP per capita.”51 In explaining its focus on economic growth, 
the OECD stated that, even though “there is not necessarily a direct 
link  between  economic  growth  and  overall  well-being,”  economic 
growth “should increase the level of public expenditure that can be 
regarded as ‘affordable’ and make it easier to keep public debt within 
sustainable bounds.”52 
In its report, the OECD considered “four broad groups of taxes 
—  consumption,  property,  personal  income  and  corporate/capital 
income  taxes.”53  Of  these  four  groups,  the  OECD  concluded  that 
taxes  on  corporate  and  capital  income  are  the  most  damaging  to 
economic growth, followed by personal income taxes.54 A pro-growth 
tax  reform  would,  according  to  the  OECD,  involve  “shifting  the 
balance of taxation away from income taxes and towards a mixture of 
consumption taxes and taxes on immovable property, particularly on 
residential  property.”55  Such  a  tax  reform  would  be  even  “more 
effective in increasing growth if the design of the VAT were improved 
at the same time — by removing exemptions, zero-rating and reduced 
rates.”56 Similarly, to the extent that income taxes are retained in the 
reform, the OECD advocated in favor of broadening the income tax 
base and lowering the rates, particularly the top rates.57 
The OECD examined tax reform trends in its member countries 
to determine the extent to which they followed its “‘tax and growth’ 
recommendations.”58 It concluded that many OECD member states 
had “cut personal and corporate tax rates while broadening the tax 
base” and that there was a trend toward “increased use of value-

added  taxes,”  though  there  was  “a  general  trend  to  higher  VAT 
rates.”59  With  these  trends  in  mind,  the  OECD  then  spent  the 
following  chapters  identifying  the  obstacles  to  tax  reform  and 
providing recommendations on how to surmount them in order to 
implement pro-growth tax reforms.60 
Similarly, the European Commission issued a report in October 
2011 outlining tax reforms in European Union member states that, for 
the first time, bore the subtitle “Tax Policy Challenges for Economic 
Growth and Fiscal Sustainability.”61 After surveying the tax reform 
trends in European Union member states since the onset of the global 
financial and economic crisis,62 the European Commission discussed 
what it called the “quality of taxation” with a “focus on the effects of 
taxation on GDP and on long-term and sustainable economic growth. 
This  reflects  the  key  priority  for  Europe  of  achieving  smart, 
sustainable and inclusive growth.”63 The European Commission then 
screened  member  states  to  determine  which  could  benefit  from 
“improving the structure of taxation to enhance economic growth.”64 
In  keeping  with  its  focus  on  “smart,  sustainable,  and  inclusive 
growth,”  the  European  Commission  made  recommendations  for 
relieving the tax burden on labor — particularly the tax burden on 
low-skilled  workers  and  secondary  earners  (who  are  primarily 
women) — and shifting toward a greater reliance on taxes on property 
and  consumption  (especially  where  the  level  of  these  taxes  is 
relatively  low).65  Having  earlier  dismissed  concerns  about  the 
regressivity of these taxes, the European Commission advocated this 
shift  because  property  and  consumption  taxes  “are  the  least 
detrimental to growth.”66 
Outside of the OECD and the European Union, in late 2011, 
Prime Minister Vladimir Putin added his voice to the international 
chorus linking tax reform with economic growth when he stated that

Russia “needs a resolute tax maneuver. It needs a modern structure of 
the tax system; we have to think about optimizing the taxes which are 
crucial for quality economic growth.”67 Economic growth is on the 
minds of tax reformers not only in the United States but also around 
the world. 
III.  TAX REFORM ≠ ECONOMIC GROWTH 
As mentioned in the introduction to this article, the general aim 
of  tax  systems  is  to  finance  public  expenditures.68  Put  differently, 
“[t]ax law is a basic institution that shapes society and must serve the 
public good.”69 Yet, our tax reform discourse does not focus directly 
on how reform can be used as a vehicle for advancing the public good. 
Instead, calling to mind a phrase often attributed to John F. Kennedy 
— “A rising tide raises all the boats”70 — tax reform discourse in the 
United States has come to focus on advancing economic growth as a 
proxy or indirect route for advancing the public good. But, as the 
studies cited in the introduction to this article highlight, advancing 
economic growth is not necessarily and ineluctably an end that serves 
the good of the public. In fact, in recent decades, a very small (and 
wealthy) slice of the population has reaped the lion’s share of the 
rewards  of  economic  growth,  which  makes  the  goal  of  advancing 
economic growth appear to be one that primarily serves the private 
good of an already privileged few. 
This  Part  draws  on  the  development  literature  to  break  the 
connection  between  tax  reform  and  economic  growth.  The  first 
section  briefly  explores  why:  (1)  under  the  best  of  conditions, 
economic growth is a poor proxy for human development; and (2) 
under current conditions, it is a highly misleading proxy for human 
development. The next section describes the journey of important 
contributors to the development literature away from a narrow focus 
on economic growth and per capita income toward a broader view

(and the creation of broader measures) of human development. It 
then  turns  to  describing  what  this  broader  view  of  human 
development looks like as well as some of the metrics that have been 
developed to measure it. This Part closes with a description of the 
lessons that those who participate in tax reform debates can learn 
from the journey in the development literature away from a singular 
focus  on  economic  growth  and  toward  a  broader  view  of  human 
development. 
A.  Economic Growth as a Poor Proxy for Development 
Even when the rising tide is raising all the boats, economic growth 
falls  short  as  a  proxy  for  human  development.  For  example,  the 
economist and philosopher Amartya Sen has persuasively argued that: 
An  adequate  conception  of  development  must  go  much 
beyond the accumulation of wealth and the growth of gross 
national product and other income-related variables. Without 
ignoring the importance of economic growth, we must look 
well beyond it. 
The ends and means of development require examination and 
scrutiny  for  a  fuller  understanding  of  the  development 
process;  it  is  simply  not  adequate  to  take  as  our  basic 
objective just the maximization of income or wealth, which is, 
as  Aristotle  noted,  “merely  useful  and  for  the  sake  of 
something  else.”  For  the  same  reason,  economic  growth 
cannot sensibly be treated as an end in itself.71 
Economist Sabina Alkire has further enumerated the shortcomings of 
economic growth as a measure of human development: 
Yet dissatisfaction with GDP and economic growth rates as 
adequate metrics of well-being is rising for several reasons. 
First, although GDP is useful for many purposes, it does not 
reflect equity nor the composition of growth. Second, some 
high  GDP  growth  strategies  have  created  financial 
instabilities  and  crises.  Third,  GDP  does  not  reflect  the 
burden on the earth’s resources. Fourth, people often value 
achievements that do not show up immediately or at all in 
high  income  and  growth  figures:  health;  knowledge;

livelihoods; relationships; safety; art and culture; happiness, 
self-direction; and political freedoms. Naturally people want 
good incomes and work hard to obtain them. But income is 
not the sum total of human life.72 
And economists Gustav Ranis, Frances Stewart, and Yili Dong have 
concluded, based on a group of country studies, that countries cannot 
move into a virtuous cycle where human development and economic 
growth are mutually supporting and reinforcing “by according sole 
priority to [economic growth].”73 Instead, to enter a virtuous cycle, 
countries have to place priority on human development.74 
But what is, in the best of conditions, a partial and imperfect 
proxy for human development now provides nothing less than a highly 
misleading and distorted picture of human development in the United 
States. The distortion stems from the fact that, as demonstrated by the 
economic work discussed in the introduction to this article,75 the rising 
tide has “swamped the majority of people”76 while raising only the 
yachts of the wealthiest and most privileged.77 It has become nearly 
impossible to open the newspaper each morning, whether physically 
or virtually, without seeing a story that reinforces this feeling. To list 
but a few examples of stories appearing in newspapers around the 
country:

with  greater  declines  experienced  by  (1)  African 
Americans and Latino/as than by whites and (2) those who 
already had lower incomes.78 
(cid:131)  A Census Bureau report indicated that nearly one in six 
Americans lived in poverty in 2010, with disproportionate 
effects felt by African Americans, Latino/as, and women.79 
Reinforcing the feeling of growing income inequality, the 
Census Bureau report further noted that median household 
income  has  declined  by  7.1%  since  1999,  but  that  the 
decline  for  the  bottom  ten  percent  was  a  much  higher 
12.1% in contrast to a much smaller decline of 1.5% for the 
top ten percent and an increase in income for the top one 
percent.80 
(cid:131)  A Pew Research Center report analyzing census data found 
that the wealth gap between whites, on the one hand, and 
African Americans (with 1/20th the wealth of whites) and 
Latino/as (with 1/18th of the wealth of whites), on the other, 
was wider at the end of the 2007–2009 recession than it had 
been at any time since the Census Bureau began collecting 
this  data.81  And,  “[i]n  every  ethnic  group,  the  Pew 
researchers found, the poorest fared worst.”82 
(cid:131)  An Economic Policy Institute snapshot showed that from 
1983–2009 nearly 82% of the gains in wealth went to the 
wealthiest five percent of households (with nearly half of 
that amount going to the top one percent while the other 
half was split by the top four percent); in contrast, the 
bottom sixty percent of households experienced a 7.5% 
decline in wealth.83 Or, put differently, “[t]he bottom 60 
percent of households actually had less wealth in 2009 than

in  1983,  meaning  they  did  not  participate  at  all  in  the 
growth of wealth over this period.”84 
(cid:131)  A Congressional Budget Office report found that, from 
1979 through 2007, “[t]he top 1 percent of earners more 
than  doubled  their  share  of  the  nation’s  income”  and 
“government  policy  [is] . . .  doing  less  to  reduce  the 
concentration of income.”85 In particular, the report noted 
that federal tax policy has had a smaller equalizing effect, 
given a shift during that time period away from income 
taxes  and  toward  payroll  taxes.86  During  those  three 
decades, the top one percent saw their “average inflation-
adjusted  after-tax  income  [grow]  by  275  percent.”87  In 
contrast, the poorest twenty percent of the population saw 
their income grow by only 18% during that period.88 
Instead of using such a deeply flawed proxy, the time has come to 
focus  on  advancing  human  development  more  directly.  The 
development  literature  has  already  undergone  a  similar 
transformation, with important contributors moving away from an 
unbending focus on economic growth and toward a more holistic view 
of  development.89  For  instance,  Amartya  Sen  regards  “identifying 
development with the growth of gross national product, or with the 
rise  in  personal  incomes”  as  examples  of  “narrower  views  of 
development.”90 And Mahbub ul Haq has observed: 
[A]fter many decades of development, we are rediscovering 
the obvious — that people are both the means and the end of 
economic development. Often, this simple truth gets obscured 
because we are used to talking in abstractions, in aggregates, 
in numbers. Human beings, fortunately too stubborn to lend

Other participants in debates over development policy have similarly 
expanded their horizons beyond economic growth.92 The next section 
briefly traces this journey toward a more expansive view of human 
development. 
B.  Emergence of the Idea of Human Development 
Although “[m]eeting . . . basic human needs became the dominant 
development priority” in the 1970s, this “strategy was killed off within 
five years” due to “a return to economic orthodoxy” in the 1980s.93 
During the 1980s and 1990s, in response to the debt crisis, “[s]tructural 
adjustment dominated economic policymaking in Latin America and 
Africa,”94 leading to a rise in poverty.95 Alongside this “ideological 
shift in favour of the role of markets in economic management, there 
was an important evolution in development thinking — focusing on 
people-centred  approaches.  The  work  of  the  human  development 
approach contributed significantly to this trend.”96 Then, in 1990, a 
team working under the auspices of the United Nations Development 
Program (UNDP), with Amartya Sen as an adviser,97 issued the first

Human  Development  Report  (HDR)  “partly  in  response  to  this 
inhospitable environment.”98 
[T]he first annual Human Development Report . . . promoted 
a  comprehensive  vision  and  an  alternative  to  neoliberal 
analysis and policy. The reports of the series brought the 
concept of human development to worldwide attention and 
gave it economic breadth and philosophical depth. They also 
attracted exceptional media attention in both developed and 
developing  countries.  In  addition  to  presenting  a  new 
paradigm for economic and social development, successive 
reports  expounded  the  approach  in  relation  to  key  areas: 
 
96, at 226 (describing Amartya Sen as a “long standing friend” of Mahbub ul Haq 
who “played a key role in developing the HDRs and in defining the concept and 
measurement of human development”; Sen is also described as playing an important 
role  in  three  HDRs  that  “expanded  the  conceptual  foundations  of  the  human 
development approach” in the early 2000s by focusing on human rights, cultural 
liberty, and democracy). 
The HDRs typically contain a caveat that they do not necessarily reflect the 
views of the UNDP but only those of the team that produced them. Yet, “[t]he 
independence and integrity of its authors has indeed been the strength of the HDR.” 
McNeill, supra note 92, at 11–12. In fact, when describing the history leading up to the 
first HDRs, Richard Ponzio states: 
To serve the interests of the global community, [Mahbub ul Haq] felt that 
the report would need to promote a candid, uninhibited policy dialogue on 
the state of people’s well-being instead of only on the state of national 
economies.  Consequently,  Haq  sought  and  successfully  secured  from 
Draper  [the  UNDP  administrator]  complete  intellectual  freedom  and 
editorial independence. 
Ponzio, supra note 95, at 89. For example, the 1990 HDR contains the following 
caveat in its foreword: “The views expressed in this Report are those of the team and 
not  necessarily  shared  by  UNDP  or  its  Governing  Council  or  the  member 
governments of UNDP. The essence of any such report must be its independence and 
its intellectual integrity.” William H. Draper III, Foreword to U.N. DEV. PROGRAM, 
HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 1990, at iii, iv (1990) [hereinafter 1990 HDR].

What was the state of the world — or, more specifically, the world of 
development policy — at that time (i.e. the late 1980s)? This was the period 
of structural adjustment, and human development can rightly be seen as a 
reaction against these policies, and the ideas on which they were based. It

growth, and more specifically against the policies of structural adjustment.

The introduction of the HDR led to the production of individual 
country human development reports, to the writing of “[n]umerous 
books and articles about human development,” to the launch of the 
Journal of Human Development in 2000, and to the creation of “[a]n 
International Association for Human Development Capabilities [that] 
now has a membership approaching a thousand or so members in 
seventy countries . . . .”100 In short, “[t]here can be little doubt that the 
concept of ‘human development’ has had a profound influence on 
thinking about development.”101 
Even  though  the  HDRs  are  produced  independently  of  the 
UNDP,102 the United Nations’ imprimatur has been instrumental in 
the rapid spread of the idea of human development: 
The  UNDP’s  administrative  and  financial  support  proved 
critical for the rapidity with which human development ideas 
were promoted and caught on worldwide. This made possible 
a widespread program of advocacy and outreach. If the ideas 
of human development had been developed and promoted

fields — economic, political, cultural.”

legitimacy and the media gave them attention.103 
C.  Defining Human Development 
1.  A Starting Point 
Despite a lack of consensus regarding development policy,104 the 
previous section demonstrates that “new trends are emerging” in the 
development literature, including an increasing recognition that (1) 
there is more to development than economic growth and per capita 
income  and  (2)  “captur[ing]  the  ‘missing’  dimensions . . .  is 
increasingly feasible.”105 But if economic growth provides us with a 
narrow  view  of  human  development  and  there  is  a  trend  toward 
taking a broader view, then what does that broader view of human 
development look like? 
  To begin this description, let us start with a statement from 
the first HDR: 
People are the real wealth of a nation. The basic objective of 
development is to create an enabling environment for people 
to enjoy long, healthy and creative lives. This may appear to 
be a simple truth. But it is often forgotten in the immediate 
concern with the accumulation of commodities and financial 
wealth.106 
It is worth quoting further from the 1990 HDR because it contains the 
“richest introduction of any of the reports.”107 In an especially relevant 
passage, the 1990 HDR explains how people are often forgotten in 
debates over development: 
Technical  considerations  of  the  means  to  achieve  human 
development  —  and  the  use  of  statistical  aggregates  to

  105  2010 HDR, supra note 6, at 19–20; see Fukuda-Parr, supra note 96, at 251 
(describing the different competing/intertwined strands of the current development 
discourse).

2012]  Tax Reform Discourse  227 
measure national income and its growth — have at times 
obscured the fact that the primary objective of development 
is to benefit people. There are two reasons for this. First, 
national  income  figures,  useful  though  they  are  for  many 
purposes, do not reveal the composition of income or the real 
beneficiaries. Second, people often value achievements that 
do not show up at all, or not immediately, in higher measured 
income or growth figures: better nutrition and health services, 
greater access to knowledge, more secure livelihoods, better 
working  conditions,  security  against  crime  and  physical 
violence, satisfying leisure hours, and a sense of participating 
in  the  economic,  cultural  and  political  activities  of  their 
communities. Of course, people also want higher incomes as 
one  of  their  options.  But  income  is  not  the  sum  total  of 
human life.108 
As this passage makes clear, economic growth is a means of advancing 
human development but not the end of human development. In other 
words, “[t]he purpose of development is to enlarge all human choices, 
not just income.”109 Far from being “antigrowth,” however, the human 
development  approach  focuses  on  both  the  quality  and  the 
distribution of growth because, “to fully exploit the opportunities for 
improved  well-being  that  growth  offers,  it  needs  to  be  properly 
managed.”110 Attention must be paid to enhancing people’s ability to 
participate in growth, to the distribution of income and assets, to using 
growth to support and sustain advances in human development that 
could  (and  did)  begin  without  economic  growth,  and  to  the 
empowerment of people.111 Empowerment is important because, “[i]f 
people can exercise their choices in the political, social and economic 
spheres,  there  is  a  good  prospect  that  growth  will  be  strong, 
democratic, participatory and durable.”112

2.  A Dynamic Approach: Stability and Flexibility 
Over the years, the individual HDRs have “emphasized different 
aspects  of  human  development,”  but  “the  definition  of  human 
development  has  been  fairly  stable  over  time.”113  Development 
economist Sakiko Fukuda-Parr nicely encapsulates the coexistence of 
stability and flexibility in the human development approach when she 
states that “[t]he evolution of the human development approach has 
been a process where the ends have been defined consistently while 
means  have  changed  in  response  to  new  policy  challenges.”114  In 
keeping  with  the  “dynamic,  not  calcified”  approach  of  human 
development, the 2010 HDR reaffirmed and refined the definition of 
human development: 
Human development is the expansion of people’s freedoms to 
live long, healthy and creative lives; to advance other goals 
they have reason to value; and to engage actively in shaping 
development equitably and sustainably on a shared planet. 
People  are  both  the  beneficiaries  and  drivers  of  human 
development, as individuals and in groups.115 
As this passage indicates, political participation, cultural expression, 
empowerment, and each individual’s role as an agent of change — and 
not just “as [a] beneficiar[y] of economic and social processes” — are 
all important components of human development.116 Conversely, the 
concentration of political power in the hands of a few is worrisome, 
making “changes in power relations central to the agenda for human 
development.”117 In other words, democratic participation and debate 
are centrally important to human development.118 
3.  Intellectual Grounding: Sen’s Capability Approach 
This people-centered conceptualization of human development is 
strongly  grounded  in  Amartya  Sen’s  capability  approach,119  which

2012]  Tax Reform Discourse  229 
focuses on “the ‘capabilities’ of persons to lead the kind of lives they 
value — and have reason to value.”120 This notion of “capabilities” is, 
in turn, grounded in the lived reality; that is, “[a] person’s ‘capability’ 
refers to the alternative combinations of functionings that are feasible 
for her to achieve.”121 For example, if we are to focus on a disabled 
individual’s “real opportunity to pursue her objectives,” then we must 
account for the fact that she might, in reality, have a lesser chance to 
achieve  her  objectives  than  would  “an  able-bodied  person  with  a 
smaller  basket  of  primary  goods.”122  “Capability  is  thus  a  kind  of 
freedom: the substantive freedom to achieve alternative functioning 
combinations (or, less formally put, the freedom to achieve various 
lifestyles).”123 
Applying this approach to the development context, Sen “treats 
the freedoms of individuals as the basic building blocks.”124 He views 
individual freedoms as having both a constitutive and an instrumental 
role in development.125 Sen explains the constitutive role of freedom 
as follows: 
The constitutive role of freedom relates to the importance of 
substantive freedom in enriching human life. The substantive 
freedoms include elementary capabilities like being able to 
avoid  such  deprivations  as  starvation,  undernourishment, 
escapable morbidity and premature mortality, as well as the 
freedoms  that  are  associated  with  being  literate  and 
numerate,  enjoying  political  participation  and  uncensored 
speech and so on.126 
Yet freedom is not only the “primary end” of development but also its 
 
moved  to  centre  stage.  Development  is  analysed  and  understood  in  terms  of 
people.”); see generally Amartya Sen, Capability and Well-Being, in THE QUALITY OF 
LIFE 30 (Martha Nussbaum & Amartya Sen eds., 1993). For a summary of Sen’s work 
on the capability approach as it relates to human development, tracing it from the 
publication of a 1979 lecture through the publication of THE IDEA OF JUSTICE in 2009, 
see UNDP, supra note 72, at 24–30. For a more general survey of Sen’s and others’

“principal  means.”127  Thus,  freedoms  also  have  a  role  to  play  in 
contributing, “directly or indirectly, to the overall freedom people 
have  to  live  the  way  they  would  like  to  live.”128  For  example, 
“development of the people . . . also facilitate[s] development by the 
people; healthy and educated people [are] better able to make choices 
for themselves.”129 Sen groups instrumental freedoms into five basic 
categories:  political  freedoms  (e.g.,  civil  rights,  democracy,  and 
freedom of the press), economic facilities (“opportunities . . . to utilize 
economic resources for the purpose of consumption, or production, or 
exchange”),  social  opportunities  (e.g.,  education  and  health  care), 
transparency  guarantees  (i.e.,  the  openness  necessary  for  mutual 
trust), and protective security (i.e., the social safety net).130 
4.  The Dimensions of Human Development 
As  Fukuda-Parr  explains,  “the  different  dimensions  of  human 
development are complementary. Much of the policy challenge for 
human development lies in understanding the instrumentality of these 
different dimensions.”131 Similarly, Sabina Alkire has observed: 
Human development is multidimensional and its components 
are  interconnected.  Thus  analyses  and  policies to  advance 
human development take a holistic view. They identify how 
powerful  means  such  as  economic  growth  best  advance 
human development across time. They clarify the sequence 
and type of investments that expand key capabilities most 
effectively. And they engage in periodic public debate about 
values and priorities.132 
Echoing the definition of human development quoted above from the 
2010  HDR,  Alkire  also  notes  that  “[p]olicies  to  advance  human 
development  often  consider  principles  such  as  poverty  reduction, 
equity, efficiency, participation, the sustainability of outcomes across 
time  and  on  this  planet,  responsibility  and  respect  for  human 
rights.”133

Because human development is an ongoing project, sustainability 
is a key concern, and one that is intimately linked with equity.134 After 
all, if current advances come at the expense of future generations, 
then “future generations are exposed to possibly catastrophic losses in 
human development.”135 By the same token, however, “in our anxiety 
to protect the future generations, we must not overlook the pressing 
claims of the less privileged today.”136 Thus, we must be concerned 
both about the equitable distribution of human development — that 
is,  of  the  opportunity  to  lead  worthwhile  lives  —  among  those 
currently inhabiting our planet (intragenerational equity) and about 
its  equitable  distribution  between  current  and  future  generations 
(intergenerational equity).137 Or, as Helen Clark has pointedly put it, 
“[w]e  have  a  collective  responsibility  towards  the  least  privileged 
among us today and in the future around the world — and a moral 
imperative  to  ensure  that  the  present  is  not  the  enemy  of  the

the environment).

Sustainability, 28 WORLD DEV. 2029, 2030 (2000). 
  137  See 2010 HDR, supra note 6, at 72 (“Human development cannot be built on 
exploitation of some groups by others or on greater access to resources and power by 
some  groups.  Inequitable  development  is  not  human  development.”);  id.  at  19 
(“Human development requires that people have the freedoms and choices to fulfil 
[sic] their needs, desires and wants. Of course, people still unborn cannot make 
decisions for themselves — but we can preserve the conditions of their future agency. 
Human development also signals that intragenerational equity is as important as 
intergenerational equity.”). 
We have emphasized that sustainability is a matter of distributional equity 
in a very broad sense, that is, of sharing the capacity for well-being between 
present people and future people in an acceptable way—that is in a way 
which neither the present generation nor the future generations can readily 
reject . . . . 
There would, however, be something distinctly odd if we were deeply 
concerned  for  the  well-being  of  the  future — and  as  yet  unborn —
generations  while  ignoring  the  plight  of  the  poor  today.  The  moral 
obligation underlying sustainability is an injunction to preserve the capacity 
for future people to be as well off as we are. This has a terribly hollow ring 
if it is not accompanied by a moral obligation to protect and enhance the 
well-being of present people who are poor and deprived.

D.  Measuring Human Development 
1.  The Human Development Index 
Contributors  to  the  development  literature  have  not  only 
discussed this broader view of human development in the abstract, but 
they  have  also  attempted  to  craft  concrete  metrics  for  measuring 
human development. For example, in 1990, the first HDR introduced 
the Human Development Index (HDI) in an effort to move past the 
development literature’s narrow focus on economic growth and to 
expand the scope of development measures.139 The HDI “proved to be 
a very powerful complement to the concept of human development,” 
turning out to be both eye-catching and controversial.140 The human 
development approach was successful because of “its ability to bridge 
the  gap  between  research  and  policy.  The  concept  ‘human 
development’, and the associated HDI, are seen as very relevant to 
development policy, while firmly grounded in academic terms.”141 
To  better  measure  human  development,  the  HDI  combines 
information  along  three  different  dimensions.  Recognizing  that 
income has a role (but not the only role) to play in development, the 
HDI considers (1) per capita income, (2) schooling (both mean years 
of schooling and expected years of schooling), and (3) health (life 
expectancy at birth).142 The HDI is meant to rival “the handy usability 
of the crude GNP . . . but, unlike GNP, without being oblivious of 
everything  other  than  incomes  and  commodities.”143  Yet,  as  Sen 
himself has cautioned, “the huge breadth of the human development 
approach must not be confused, as it sometimes is, with the slender 
limits of the HDI.”144

  144  Sen, supra note 139, at vi. Indeed, in explaining why he opposes a “canonical” 
list of capabilities but supports the use of lists of capabilities for specific purposes, Sen 
relied upon the HDI as an example: INFANTI.FINAL.DOC  10/23/2012  6:03 PM 
2012]  Tax Reform Discourse  233 
The 2010 HDR marked the twentieth anniversary of the HDI’s 
introduction. The team writing the 2010 HDR took this occasion to 
engage  in  some  retrospection  and  found  a  “lack  of  a  significant 
correlation between economic growth and improvements in health 
and  education.”145  For  instance,  the  2010  HDR  compared  and 
contrasted  two  countries—China  and  Tunisia—to  demonstrate  the 
disconnect between economic growth and improvements in health and 
education: 
In 1970 a baby girl born in Tunisia could expect to live 55 
years; one born in China, 63 years. Since then, China’s per 
capita  GDP  has  grown  at  a  breakneck  pace  of  8  percent 
annually, while Tunisia’s has grown at 3 percent. But a girl 
born today in Tunisia can expect to live 76 years, a year 
longer than a girl born in China. And while only 52 percent of 
Tunisian children were enrolled in school in 1970, today’s 
gross enrolment ratio is 78 percent, considerably higher than 
China’s 68 percent.146 
 
[The HDI] was based on a very minimal listing of capabilities, with a 
particular focus on getting at a minimally basic quality of life, calculable 
from available statistics, in a way that the GNP or GDP failed to capture. 
Lists of capabilities have to be used for various purposes, and so long as we 
understand what we are doing (and in particular that we are getting a list 
for a particular reason, related to a particular assessment, evaluation, or 
critique), we do not put ourselves against other lists that may be relevant or 
useful for other purposes.

development). 
  145  2010 HDR, supra note 6, at 4; see id. at 46–64 (explaining the data and 
reasoning supporting this conclusion). The 2010 HDR draws a distinction between 
levels of income and health and education, on the one hand, and changes in income 
and health and education, on the other. There is a positive correlation between a 
nation’s level of income and its level of health and education; however, there is no 
significant correlation between change in income and change in health and education.

In  fact,  the  2010  HDR  concluded  that  “human  development  is 
different  from  economic  growth  and  substantial  achievements  are 
possible even without fast growth.”147 
2.  Unmasking Unequal Distribution of Human Development 
Economic measures may not only be limiting but also misleading. 
Per capita income, for instance, is nothing more than average income. 
Averages such as this can mask as much — or sometimes more — 
than  they  reveal.148  In  the  case  of  income,  averaging  can  mask 
profound  levels  of  inequality  in  a  society  —  and,  of  course,  will 
completely miss inequalities along other lines (e.g., health, education, 
employment, and social acceptance).149 Indeed, in discussing the ways 
in which average income can be misleading, the 2010 HDR points to 
the United States as an example of a country where “mean income is 
almost a third higher than median income, and the gap is growing.”150 
  a.  Taking Inequality into Account 
To address such concerns, the 2010 HDR introduced a refined 
version of the HDI — the Inequality-adjusted HDI (IHDI).151 After 
taking  inequality  along  each  of  the  dimensions  of  the  HDI  into 
account, “the global HDI of 0.62 in 2010 would fall to 0.49, which 
 
levels of human development. But that does not necessarily happen, so there is no 
automatic link between economic growth and human lives.”); id. at 40–41 (providing 
examples). 
  147  2010 HDR, supra note 6, at 5. 
Although there is weak correlation between [economic prosperity and 
human development], the data shows that many developing countries do 
poorly on many social and human rights indicators in spite of growth. The 
obverse is true as well; with clear priorities, countries can make significant 
progress in human development even with slow economic growth, at least 
for a decade or so. Yet the pursuit of growth is typically taken as the central 
goal  of  economic  policymaking.  In  contrast,  the  human  development 
approach concentrates on people-focused objectives and emphasizes that 
economic and political actions should be treated as means to these human 
ends, not as ends in themselves.

represents a drop from the high to the medium HDI category.”152 In 
2010, the average loss in HDI due to inequality was 22%, and the 
losses ranged from a low of 6% to a high of 45%.153 
A few examples may help to underscore the impact of inequality 
on measuring human development. Taking inequality into account, 
the United States would see its HDI drop by more than 11%, and it 
would fall nine places in the HDI ranking.154 The Republic of Korea 
would see its HDI drop by nearly 17%, and it would fall 18 places in 
the HDI ranking.155 Brazil would see its HDI drop by 27%, and it 
would fall 15 places in the HDI ranking.156 
  b.  Taking Gender Inequality into Account 
The 2010 HDR also introduced a more refined measure of gender 
inequality — the Gender Inequality Index (GII).157 The GII takes 
account  of  three  dimensions:  (1)  women’s  reproductive  health 
(through maternal mortality ratios and adolescent fertility rates), (2) 
women’s  empowerment  (through  national  parliamentary 
representation and educational attainment), and (3) women’s labor 
force participation.158 As measured by the GII, the average loss in 
achievement for the ten countries closest to gender equality was 23% 
while the average loss in achievement for the ten countries farthest 
from gender equality was 79%.159 
Again,  a  few  examples  will  help  to  underscore  the  impact  of 
gender  inequality  on  measuring  human  development.  The  United 
States ranks 4th in the HDI but only 37th in the GII, with a 40% loss 
in achievement due to gender inequality.160 Qatar ranks 38th in the 
HDI (placing it in the very high human development category) but 
ranks 94th in the GII, with a 67% loss in achievement due to gender

violence and local-level empowerment.” Id. at 92, 94.

(placing it in the high human development category) but ranks 128th 
in the GII, with a 76% loss in achievement due to gender inequality.162 
Mexico ranks 56th in the HDI (also placing it in the high human 
development category) but ranks 68th in the GII, with a nearly 58% 
loss in achievement due to gender inequality.163 
3.  Further Enriching Human Development Measures 
The 2010 HDR candidly recognizes the limits of these measures, 
stating  that,  “as  with  any  aggregate  measure  and  international 
comparison,  it  simplifies  and  captures  only  part  of  what  human 
development entails.”164 There is much more to human development 
“than  basic  needs  and  social  sector  development.”165  Thus,  the 
purpose of the HDI and the related measures discussed above “is not 
to build an unassailable indicator of well-being — it is to redirect 
attention  towards  human-centred  development  and  to  promote 
debate over how we advance the progress of societies.”166 Among 
other dimensions that the 2010 HDR acknowledges are important to 
human development are human rights and the political and social 
empowerment of groups of people, sustainability of production and 
impact  on  the  environment,  well-being,  the  availability  of  decent 
work,  and  addressing  threats  to  the  human  development  that  has 
already been achieved.167 In fact, the 2010 HDR included six new 
statistical tables that cover these additional dimensions.168

Moreover, as mentioned above,169 “there is not one ‘fixed and 
forever’  list  of  relevant  dimensions  or  capabilities.  This  flexibility 
allows human development to be relevant in different cultural and 
national  contexts.  It  also  enables  applications  that  address  ‘rich’ 
countries  and  persons  as  well  as  poorer  people  and  countries.”170 
Providing  the  intellectual  basis  for  this  observation,  Amartya  Sen 
opposed a fixed list of dimensions of human development because 
that would be “to deny the possibility of fruitful public participation 
on what should be included and why.”171 Mahbub ul Haq, “the pioneer 
of the ‘human development revolution,’”172 also “often spoke about 
human  development  as  an  ‘intellectual  journey’,  along  which  new 
concepts, measures, and policy proposals would emerge.”173 
E.  Lessons from the Development Literature 
This “intellectual journey” has much to teach contributors to tax 
reform debates. Most immediately, the human development approach 
helps us to recognize that economic growth is a poor proxy for human 
progress. Yet, notwithstanding that the human development approach 
is designed to displace economic growth as the measure of human 
development, it does not reject the importance of economic growth to 
human development. Rather, the human development approach takes 
a holistic view and situates economic growth in context by recognizing 
that,  even  though  economic  growth  may  be  a  means  to  advance 
human development, there is far more to human progress than merely 
increasing average income.174 It will be important for us to carry this 
idea of a more holistic view with us as we move into a discussion (in 
the next Part of this article) of what effects a more people-centered 
approach might have on tax reform debates. 
As we consider these effects, the human development approach 
also has important lessons for us to keep in mind regarding the quality 
 
countries and instead proposing an index of government accountability for human 
rights performance — initially to the international community and eventually to the 
people of the individual nation as well).

and distribution of development. In contrast to measures of economic 
growth, which turn a blind eye to how the benefits of that growth are 
distributed among the populace, the human development approach 
recognizes that “[h]uman development is about sustaining positive 
outcomes steadily over time and combating processes that impoverish 
people  or  underpin  oppression  and  structural  injustice.  Plural 
principles such as equity, sustainability and respect for human rights 
are  thus  key.”175  In  keeping  with  these  principles,  the  human 
development  approach  further  recognizes  the  importance  of 
intergenerational equity: 
If the basic concept is sustainable human development, each 
generation  must  meet  its  needs  without  incurring  debts  it 
cannot  repay.  That  means  avoiding  the  accumulation  of 
environmental  debts  (by  polluting  or  exhausting  natural 
resources) as well as financial debts (through unsustainable 
borrowing), social debts (by neglecting to invest in human 
development)  and  demographic  debts  (by  permitting 
unchecked population growth or urbanization).176 
To anticipate the inevitable critiques from defenders of the status 
quo, let me clearly state that, viewed from this perspective, human 
development is not just a project for so-called developing countries.177 
In reality, all countries are “developing”: 
[H]uman development pertains to all countries at all levels of 
development and, indeed, to all people including the wealthy 
and elite. Whereas the decision to give priority attention to 
the poor or relatively deprived may be one feature of human

equity, sustainability, productivity, and empowerment as key concepts for the human 
development approach); Sen, supra note 172, at xi–xii (“The Human Development 
Reports have to be judged, ultimately, not just as contributions to our knowledge and 
understanding (which, of course, they are), but also as robust instruments for making 
the world more liveable [sic] and less unjust. Not only did Mahbub make a path-
breaking contribution to an epistemological advance, but he also helped to turn a 
page in informed practical reasoning.”).

conceptualization of developing and transition countries as ‘“backward,” “primitive,” 
“feudal,” “medieval,” “developing country,” and “pre-industrial,”’ hence representing 
them as deficient in relation to a ‘Western’ (i.e., ‘developed,’ or ‘international’) 
norm.”  (quoting  SARA  MILLS,  DISCOURSE:  THE  NEW  CRITICAL  IDIOM  114,  117

development in national applications — and commendable in 
them — one could also imagine a group meeting of OECD 
country leaders who wished to support the well-being of their 
citizens rather than merely add to their GDP. This too, would 
be human development.178 
In emphasizing the universality of the human development approach, 
this passage unfortunately glosses over the fact that countries are not 
monoliths but groups of people. In other words, the divide between 
wealthier and poorer countries is not the only important divide. Even 
within wealthier countries such as the United States, the wealthy and 
privileged are only a portion of the population (and, numerically, may 
constitute  only  a  small  portion  of  the  population).  These  internal 
divisions are also important to discussions of human development 
because “[t]he discipline of universalism requires us to extend the 
same  concern  for  all  human  beings  —  irrespective  of  race,  class, 
gender,  nationality,  or  generation.”179  Or,  as  Sen  has  put  it,  even 
though the human development approach applies to all countries, it 
“is first and foremost an ally of the poor” and disadvantaged.180 
Indeed,  by  some  measures  of  human  development,  there  are 
segments of the U.S. population that are worse off than those in so-
called developing countries. For example, Amartya Sen points out 
that, although African Americans are on average richer than people in 
the so-called third world, they “have an absolutely lower chance of 
reaching mature ages than do people of many third world societies, 
such as China, or Sri Lanka, or parts of India.”181 Sen correctly notes 
that  “the  presence  of  such  intergroup  contrasts  within  the  richer 
countries can be seen to be an important aspect of the understanding 
of development and underdevelopment.”182 Mahbub ul Haq notes that 
the 1993 HDR “brought out the HDI disparity among whites, blacks 
and  hispanics  [sic]  in  the  United  States.  It  pointed  out  that,  if 
considered  as  separate  nations,  whites  would  outrank  all  other 
countries, blacks would rank number 31 (after Trinidad and Tobago),

and hispanics [sic] would rank number 35 (next to Estonia).”183 Haq 
also notes that “gender-adjusted HDI comparisons have revealed the 
shocking reality that no country treats women as well as men.”184 
Thus, it is worth underscoring that, by eschewing misleading averages 
and  placing  people  at  the  center  of  the  discussion,  the  human 
development approach helps us to bring the most vulnerable — for 
example, the poor, women, ethnic and racial minorities, and sexual 
minorities  —  to  the  front  and  center  of  discussions  about 
development, no matter what country is concerned.185 
At the beginning of his book Reflections on Human Development, 
Mahbub ul Haq makes an interesting observation that applied to the 
development  debate  then  and  applies  equally  to  our  tax  reform 
debates now: 
Yet our preoccupation as economists is largely with saving 
and investment, exports and imports — and, of course, with 
that most convenient abstraction of all: the gross national 
product. When we do come to recognize the contributions of 
human beings as a means of development, we tend to treat 
them as almost residual elements.186 
Rather  than  focusing  on  economic  abstractions  and  treating  real 
people as residual elements of development, the time has come for us 
to stop chanting the mantra of economic growth, to learn from the 
journey in the development literature away from an unbending focus 
on economic growth, and to return to an old idea that is new again by 
placing people at the heart of tax reform debates. 187 It is to this task 
that we turn next.

economic growth) at the center of tax reform debates? How would 
our tax system change if it were viewed not simply as a means of 
encouraging economic growth for the benefit of a few but as one 
instrument (among many) for advancing human development for all? 
What changes would be made to the tax system if we were to place 
those who are most disadvantaged in our society (instead of those who 
are most privileged) at the center of the debate? 
These are the basic questions raised by this fundamental shift in 
the focus of the tax reform debate. In this short space, I can only hope 
to begin to ponder these questions. Thus, I have chosen to offer some 
preliminary thoughts in just one specific area, albeit an area of now 
seemingly perennial concern in U.S. debates over tax reform. This 
Part  discusses  the  once  again  rising  din  of  calls  to  eliminate  tax 
expenditures. Eliminating tax expenditures — what are commonly 
referred to as tax “loopholes” or, even more pejoratively, “special 
interest loopholes”188 —  has become the holy grail of tax reform. 
Often, the crusade to close loopholes is portrayed as a means to an 
end — broadening the tax base in order to lower tax rates as a growth-
enhancing measure.189 As we will see, placing people at the center of 
tax reform debates has important ramifications in this area. 
A bit of background is necessary before entering into a discussion 
of  what  a  people-centered  approach  might  have  to  say  about  tax 
expenditures. Accordingly, this section begins with a discussion of the 
popularization of tax expenditure analysis during the 1960s and 1970s 
as well as antecedent debates regarding the need to close loopholes in 
an  effort  to  move  toward  a  comprehensive  tax  base.  Given  that 
background and taking a holistic view that is in keeping with the 
human  development  approach,  I  then  proceed  to  suggest  that  we

should  call  a  truce  in  the  war  on  tax  loopholes  because  tax 
expenditures are not some alien presence invading the tax domain but 
are  a  normal  and  natural  part  of  the  tax  laws.  Finally,  I  turn  to 
discussing the impact on tax expenditures (and tax reform debates 
more  generally)  of  shifting  people  —  and,  particularly,  the  most 
disadvantaged among us — to the center of the debate. 
A.  Tax Expenditures: Some Necessary Background 
During the 1960s and 1970s, Stanley Surrey (at times, along with 
co-author  Paul  McDaniel)  popularized  tax  expenditure  analysis.190 
Surrey  began  speaking  about  the  tax  expenditure  concept  while 
serving in the Treasury Department in 1967.191 In less than a decade, 
he spurred Congress to incorporate tax expenditure analysis into the 
annual budgeting process.192 As Bernard Wolfman has remarked: 
Writers have not generally used quotation marks around the 
term “tax expenditure” since 1974, when Congress, spurred 
by Surrey, adopted the first tax expenditure budget. A rather 
broad spectrum of people now understand that the income 
tax system is used extensively to confer monetary benefits as 
real  and  as  preferential  as  those  conferred  by  direct 
expenditure, and that tax expenditures may be less open to 
debate, to scrutiny, and to review because they are tucked 
away in the 3,000-page tax code.193 
Simply put, tax expenditure analysis “bifurcates tax provisions 
into two categories: (1) structural provisions and (2) tax preferences 
or  tax  penalties.”194  Structural  provisions  are  those  that  form  a

necessary part of the revenue-raising structure of the tax.195 
  In  contrast,  tax  preferences  and  penalties  constitute  a 
residual  category  and  include  all  provisions  that  are  not 
considered to be structural in nature. Because tax preferences 
and penalties depart from the normative tax structure, they 
have  the  effect  of  either  (1)  providing  governmental 
assistance  to  taxpayers  by  reducing  their  normative  tax 
burden or (2) exacting a penalty from taxpayers by increasing 
their  normative  tax  burden.  Proponents  of  the  tax 
expenditure concept reach this conclusion by separating tax 
preferences and penalties into their component parts. 
  Under  tax  expenditure  analysis,  each  taxpayer  can  be 
viewed as paying to the government the tax due under the 
normative income tax. Then, taxpayers who are entitled to 
tax preferences can be viewed as having received a payment 
from the government equal to the amount of the preference, 
and taxpayers who are subject to tax penalties can be viewed 
as having been required to make an additional payment to 
the government equal to the amount of the penalty. In the 
case of tax preferences, these two payments are, in practice, 
simply netted out for the sake of expediency (i.e., the tax 
payment from the taxpayer is simply reduced by the amount 
that  the  government  owes  the  taxpayer).  Thus,  under  tax 
expenditure analysis, tax preferences and penalties are the 
equivalent  of  direct  expenditure  programs  and  penalties, 
respectively.196 
Focusing their attention mainly on tax preferences rather than tax 
penalties,197  Surrey  and  McDaniel  sometimes  described  tax 
expenditure analysis as a neutral tool to aid policymakers in deciding 
between spending through direct programs and spending through tax 
preferences.198 Quite often, however, they embraced a more absolutist 
view  of  tax  preferences,  touting  their  endemic  inequity  and 
inefficiency and calling for a nearly blanket elimination of them.199

244  Virginia Tax Review  [Vol.  XXXII:205 
The following paragraphs briefly summarize the reasons why Surrey 
and McDaniel took such a dim view of tax preferences on equity and 
efficiency grounds. 
Surrey and McDaniel found tax preferences to be inequitable for 
a number of reasons. First, tax preferences that take the form of an 
exclusion or deduction result in an “upside-down” distribution of the 
tax benefit.200 In other words, because the value of deductions and 
exclusions  is  directly  related  to  a  taxpayer’s  marginal  tax  rate, 
taxpayers with higher marginal tax rates reap greater benefits from 
deductions and exclusions than taxpayers with lower marginal tax 
rates.201  Second,  tax  preferences  that  take  the  form  of  exclusions, 
deductions, or exemptions “automatically exclude nontaxpayers from 
receiving  any  benefits  whatsoever.”202  Third,  tax  preferences  treat 
“taxpayers with the same level of income differently based on the uses 
to which they put their income.”203 
Surrey and McDaniel found tax preferences to be inefficient on a 
number of different grounds. They argued that some tax preferences 
are inefficient because they do not induce the desired behavior but 
merely pay the taxpayer to engage in behavior that she would have 
engaged in even without the tax benefit.204 They argued that other tax 
preferences are inefficient because their cost (i.e., the foregone tax 
revenue)  exceeds  their  benefit  (i.e.,  the  value  of  the  behavior 
induced).205 And they argued that some tax preferences are inefficient 
because they provide a tax benefit to middlemen who are to deliver 
the government assistance to the intended beneficiary.206 
For Surrey and McDaniel, eliminating tax preferences would have 
the collateral benefit of simplifying the tax system.207 The tax system is 
inherently  complex  because  it  “must  track  the  complexity  of  the 
myriad of economic arrangements that taxpayers create.”208 Surrey 
and McDaniel argued that tax preferences unnecessarily add to this

complexities  associated  with  spending  programs.209  They  further 
argued that these additional complexities are multiplied when “tax 
reformers seek to limit the adverse effects of the tax expenditure on 
tax equity. The net result is a tax system of ever-increasing complexity 
and  financial  assistance  programs  that  are  often  irrational  and 
sometimes counterproductive.”210 
Even before Stanley Surrey coined the term “tax expenditure,”211 
however, Boris Bittker had penned an article describing the repeated 
attacks on “the ‘exceptions,’ ‘preferences,’ ‘loopholes,’ and ‘leakages’ 
in the income tax provisions of the Internal Revenue Code” following 
World  War  II.212  According  to  Bittker,  the  “‘comprehensive  tax 
base’ . . .  ha[d]  come  to  be  the  major  organizing  concept  in  most 
serious discussions of our federal income tax structure” during that 
period.213  In  fact,  many  of  the  same  arguments  that  Surrey  and 
McDaniel later proffered against tax preferences had already been 
made by these CTB advocates.214 
In  contrast  to  Surrey  and  McDaniel  and  the  earlier  CTB 
advocates, Bittker argued that moving toward a CTB patterned after 
the Schanz-Haig-Simons economic definition of income would be no 
panacea.215 He contended that a CTB would not improve our tax 
system by reducing its complexity.216 To the contrary, he argued that a

‘preferences’ and thus to ‘restore’ the tax base is to repeal all substantive parts of 
existing law except section 61(a) and the business expense and loss provisions, or to 
enact the Haig-Simons or National Income Division definition. These seem to me the 
directions in which they point, however, and I have found in their writings no other 
standards by which ‘preferences’ can be infallibly identified.”). Notably, Bittker 
employed the Schanz-Haig-Simons definition of income as a foil throughout his 
article, and Surrey and McDaniel clearly adopted that definition as their starting point 
in separating out the structural provisions of the income tax from tax preferences and 
penalties. Id. passim; Infanti, supra note 190, at 720.

CTB  “would  be  a  disaster”  because  tax  preferences  are  an 
unavoidable part of our tax system. The key is not to eliminate all 
preferences but to examine each of them separately to determine 
which should be kept and which should be discarded. Or, in Bittker’s 
own words: “[T]here are ‘preferences’ and ‘preferences’; some are 
objectionable, some are tolerable, some are unavoidable, and some 
are indispensable. A truly ‘comprehensive’ base, in short, would be a 
disaster.”217 
Bittker  further  criticized  the  CTB  advocates  for  their  logical 
inconsistency. CTB advocates openly attacked some preferences and 
loopholes (e.g., the exclusions for municipal bond interest and social 
security payments)218 but ignored others that a rigorous application of 
CTB  would  also  require  to  be  eliminated  (e.g.,  the  personal  and 
dependency  exemptions,  the  exclusion  for  life  insurance,  and  the 
exclusion for gifts and bequests).219 But logical inconsistency was not 
unique to CTB advocates operating before Stanley Surrey came onto 
the scene. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 (1986 Act), which is now often 
remembered as a golden moment of base broadening through the 
closing of loopholes,220 was more an exercise in political horse trading 
 
experience, to hope for a simplified tax structure in a complex society are doubly 
deluded, in my view, if they believe that a CTB will make a significant contribution to 
simplification. Most of our troublesome complexities concern issues that are either 
independent of the definitional criteria or unavoidable once we accept the departures 
that even the most committed believers in a CTB accept as desirable or necessary.”).

than an attempt to move toward a theoretically perfect and logically 
consistent CTB devoid of tax expenditures.221 
Bittker was an early — but far from the only — critic of tax 
expenditure analysis.222 I have undertaken a relatively comprehensive 
summary  of  these  critiques  elsewhere.223  For  purposes  of  this 
discussion, it is important to note that many of the critiques of tax 
expenditure analysis revolve around the (in)feasibility of drawing a 
line between (1) the structural provisions of the income tax and (2) 
tax preferences.224 Yet, notwithstanding a long parade of critics over a 
span of decades, talk of closing loopholes and broadening the tax base 
has not abated, but only grown more frequent. 
The  increasing  focus  on  tax  expenditures  should  come  as  no 
surprise. After all, the absolute number of tax expenditures doubled 
between  1974  and  2004.225  In  addition,  measuring  the  resulting 
revenue losses as a share of gross domestic product, tax expenditures 
recovered more than half of the decline that followed the 1986 Act’s 
hallowed  efforts  at  closing  loopholes.226  Furthermore,  from  1996 
through 2003, the outlay equivalent for tax expenditures (i.e., the 
amount that it would cost to operate an equivalent direct spending 
 
lawmaking and influence peddling. It was truly remarkable, a once-in-a-generation

program) actually exceeded direct discretionary spending.227 Indeed, 
the Government Accountability Office observed that, in 2004, the 
outlay equivalent for the home mortgage interest deduction (which is 
classified as a tax expenditure) was $61.5 billion, “compared to $45 
billion  in  outlays  for  the  Department  of  Housing  and  Urban 
Development, which is responsible for, among other things, mortgage 
credit and housing assistance programs.”228 
As one commentator has (however ahistorically) noted, “[t]he 
current tax reform debate is unique in one respect: It seems to be 
almost completely focused on tax expenditures.”229 Examples of this 
rhetorical focus abound and can be easily found in the sources drawn 
upon in the discussion in Part II.A above. For example, President 
Bush’s tax reform panel counted tax expenditures among “the worst 
features of our current income tax system.”230 Professor Graetz, in 
advocating a move away from an income tax toward a consumption 
tax, described our reliance on tax expenditures as being “about as 
successful  a  solution  to  our  national  needs  as  handing  out  more 
gunpowder  at  the  Alamo.”231  More  recently,  House  Speaker  John 
Boehner said that “‘[t]ax reform should deal with the whole tax code, 
both the personal side and the corporate side, and it should result in a 
code that is simpler and fairer to everyone’ . . . . He added that it 
would  be  necessary  to  eliminate  ‘deductions,  credits,  and  special 
carveouts  [sic]  in  our  tax  code’  to  accomplish  that  goal.”232 
Furthermore, Senator Carl Levin has made several proposals that he 
has argued would move toward “ending unfair tax expenditures and 
loopholes that disadvantage average taxpayers.”233 These views are 
echoed  and  amplified  by  the  general  public,  as  evidenced  by  the 
number of letters sent to the editors of newspapers in 2011 calling for 
the elimination of tax loopholes, as talk of tax reform intensified.234

B.  Calling a Truce 
As  Boris  Bittker  suggested,235  the  perennial  focus  on  tax 
expenditures is not, in itself, a problem; rather, the problem lies in the 
purpose of focusing on them.236 In tax reform debates, the purpose of 
focusing on tax expenditures is to eliminate them. This and the next 
section explain why, instead of aiming to eliminate most or all tax 
expenditures,  we  should  accept  that  tax  expenditures  are  an 
ineluctable part of our tax system. This explanation draws upon the 
human  development  approach’s  combination  of  theory  with 
pragmatism as well as its eschewal of blinkered vision in favor of 
taking  a  holistic  view  of  an  issue.  Once  we  accept  that  tax 
expenditures have a natural place in our tax system, we can begin to 
consider how to rehabilitate and reform tax expenditures so that they 
coordinate well with nontax efforts to advance human development.

motivated — explicitly or implicitly and to a greater or lesser extent 
—  by  the  notion  that  the  income  tax  can  be  made  fairer,  more 
efficient, and more administrable by adopting “a ‘neutral, scientific 
[i.e.,  economic]  definition  of . . .  income.’”238  Naturally,  academic 
commentators  are  the  ones  who  tend  to  rely  explicitly  upon  an 
economic  or  “scientific”  definition  of  income  as  their  baseline  in 
critiquing tax expenditures.239 Lay commentators (whether politicians 
or  members  of  the  general  public)  do  so  only  implicitly,  as  they 
advocate for the elimination of tax “loopholes” — a pejorative term 
that evokes a gap in, or departure from, the theoretically appropriate 
tax base.240 Moreover, the call to eliminate tax expenditures in order 
to move toward a more neutral, scientific vision of the tax base is 
often selectively made, targeting some tax preferences but leaving 
others untouched.241 In some cases, the reason for this selectivity is 
unexplained;242 in others, it is seemingly a matter of self-interest;243 
and, in yet others, it is more principled (e.g., calling for the repeal only 
of tax expenditures whose costs outweigh their benefits).244 
The basic problem with this view is that it is founded upon tax 
“exceptionalism” — the notion that tax law is unique and different 
from other areas of U.S. law.245 David Weisbach and Jacob Nussim

have pointed out that “the only way one can make the arguments 
made by CTB advocates is to treat the tax system as separate from the 
rest of the government.”246 The Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) 
has embraced this view, asserting that: 
There . . .  is  merit  to  the  argument  that  tax  expenditure 
analysis reflects tax “exceptionalism” — the belief that the 
tax system ordinarily ought not to be burdened with the sort 
of ad hoc political compromises reflected on the face of much 
spending legislation. In the view of the JCT Staff, however, 
that “exceptionalism” is largely justified.247 
From this perspective, the path to achieving a just tax system lies in 
setting tax apart from all other areas of law — rendering it neutral and 
apolitical — and then hewing as closely as possible to a theoretically 
perfect tax base.248 Thus, the tax laws should be burdened with the 
task of achieving nontax ends — if at all — only on the rare occasion 
when  the  tax  laws  can  be  shown  to  be  the  best  vehicle  for 
accomplishing  the  task.249  Even  in  its  mildest  iterations,  this  view 
privileges structural (i.e., “tax”) over nonstructural (i.e., “nontax”) 
provisions  in  the  tax  laws,  imposing  burdens  on  nonstructural 
provisions from which structural provisions are wholly exempt. 
2.  A More Realistic Starting Point 
To my mind, however, it is a serious mistake to start from the 
premise  that  tax  law  is  exceptional.  Instead,  the  starting  premise 
should be a more holistic — and realistic — one that recognizes that 
tax is not set apart from other areas of the law, from the spending side 
of the fiscal system, or from social systems more generally; rather, it is 
merely a part of this much larger sociolegal picture. A more holistic 
starting premise is also more realistic for two primary reasons: (1) the 
longevity of tax expenditures and (2) the expressive function of the 
tax laws.

252  Virginia Tax Review  [Vol.  XXXII:205 
  a.  Longevity 
Tax expenditures have been with us since the earliest days of the 
modern U.S. federal income tax and have been the target of reformers 
since at least the time when the income tax moved from being a 
“class” tax to a “mass” tax. For example, the deduction for personal 
interest — and, more particularly, home mortgage interest — dates 
back to the inception of the modern federal income tax in 1913.250 
Furthermore, as described in the previous section, the battle to 
eliminate tax expenditures has been going on for nearly seventy years 
and, despite the increasing salience of tax expenditures, there is no 
end in sight. After all, it has been nearly forty years since Congress 
mandated the compilation of a tax expenditure budget as part of the 
annual budgeting process in an effort to make tax expenditures more 
salient to lawmakers.251 As mentioned above, in the first thirty years of 
this heightened salience, the absolute number of tax expenditures was 
not reduced but actually doubled.252 
b.  Expressive Function 
This leads us into a discussion of the expressive function of the tax 
laws. Interestingly, Boris Bittker dated CTB advocates’ alarm about 
the erosion of the tax base and attacks against tax loopholes to the 
days following World War II. This coincides with the shift in the role 
of the income tax from a “class tax” on the wealthy to a “mass tax” 
that applied to the population more broadly.253 Prior to World War II, 
the income tax only applied to the wealthiest Americans and “was 
justified as a means of combating an ‘unjust concentration of wealth 
and  economic  power.’”254  As  Carolyn  Jones  has  explained,  the 
message conveyed by the income tax had a “punitive cast,” especially 
“when it was enforced, at least for a time, by publicity of certain

information from taxpayers’ returns and when the tax affairs of the 
nation’s  wealthiest  citizens  were  paraded  before  Congressional 
hearings.”255 
  (1)  “Functional Necessity” 
During World War II, the expressive function of the income tax 
changed  as  it  was  converted  from  a  form  of  punishment  against 
“‘economic royalists’” into the people’s chosen means for funding the 
costs of war.256 As mentioned above, there had been tax “preferences” 
before World War II; however: 
Millions  of  new  taxpayers  joined  the  system,  and  they 
demanded millions — well, thousands — of new preferences. 
Most were reserved for the rich and famous, but others had a 
more plebian quality. The mortgage interest deduction was a 
principal concession — a feature of the tax system since 1913, 
it took on new importance as homeownership soared in the 
postwar  era.  Similarly,  the  tax-free  treatment  of  health 
insurance benefits found a broad constituency once unions 
made employer-provided insurance a fixture of the modern 
labor market.257 
Thus,  in  the  early  days  of  the  income  tax  as  a  “mass  tax,”  tax 
preferences were viewed as a “functional necessity” to make income 
taxation palatable to a population that had previously viewed this tax 
as a “rich man’s burden.”258 
The “functional necessity” of tax preferences has not waned with 
time. For example, the home mortgage interest deduction has been 
called “the ‘most sacred tax break in the code,’ the ‘third rail of tax 
reform,’ a member of the ‘Holy Trinity of U.S. social programs,’ and 
‘an American birthright’ so ‘sacrosanct’ that the ‘mere thought of 
tampering with it was unpatriotic.’”259 Similarly, it has been said that 
the  deduction  for  charitable  contributions  is  “politically 
unassailable”260  and  “almost  a  third  rail  in  tax  policymaking . . . .

  (2)  Mirroring Society 
Tax preferences have thus been with us since the earliest days of 
the  income  tax  and  took  on  the  important  role  of  a  necessary 
palliative following World War II — a role that is still relevant today. 
But tax preferences were — and are — more than just a functional 
necessity,  they  are  a  reflection  of  our  society.  Comparative  law 
scholars generally view law as a mirror of society.262 Naturally, there is 
controversy regarding how closely law mirrors society; however, areas 
of public law, such as tax law, are thought to be particularly closely 
tied to the societies of which they are a product.263 Notwithstanding 
the general bias toward viewing tax law as technical and apolitical,264

even comparative tax scholars have come to embrace the notion that 
tax law is culturally specific: 
The level of sensitivity of tax rules to the local tax culture 
differs based on the nature of the tax rule. One can imagine 
that the ‘universal’ or ‘scientific’ rules, such as those based on 
accounting or market exchanges, are less sensitive than those 
‘indigenous’ rules that reflect political or social values, such as 
progressivity, or tax expenditures for social programs. 265 
The ties between tax law and American society can be seen in a 
number  of  areas.  For  instance,  the  tax  laws  contain  a  number  of 
preferences  that  privilege  homeowners  over  renters,  including  the 
implicit exclusion of imputed rental income from gross income, the 
allowance of a deduction for home mortgage interest, the allowance of 
a deduction for real property taxes, and the exclusion from gross 
income  of  a  specified  amount  of  gain  on  the  sale  of  a  principal 
residence.266 These tax benefits for homeownership are often viewed 
as  a  means  of  helping  individuals  realize  the  “American  dream.” 
Indeed, two years prior to the Tax Reform Act of 1986, President 
Ronald  Reagan  “explicitly  instructed  the  Treasury  Department  to 
‘preserve that part of the American dream which the home mortgage 
interest deduction symbolizes.’”267 When President Reagan released 
 
the body of beliefs and practices that are shared by tax practitioners and policy-
makers in a given society and that provide the background or context in which tax 
decisions are made, i.e., the noneconomic or at least nonquantifiable side of taxation, 
which varies between societies even though the underlying economic principles are 
largely the same. Tax culture is thus distinct from the general culture or even the legal 
culture of a given society, although there is of course no clear line between them: for 
example, the American frontier tradition, with its emphasis on independence and its 
fascination with real or imagined risk-taking, plainly affects the public’s attitudes 
toward taxation and as such exercises considerable influence on tax policy-makers. 
But the two remain conceptually and practically distinct from one another.”).

his tax plan the next year, he proposed reforms to some of the then-
existing housing tax subsidies, but “immunized the [mortgage interest 
deduction], calling it ‘central to American values’ and representative 
of  ‘America’s  unequivocal  commitment  to  private  home-
ownership.’”268 Some twenty years later, President George W. Bush 
echoed these sentiments: 
[I]n  the  executive  order  that  established  the  President’s 
Advisory Panel on Federal Tax Reform, one of the very few 
restrictions  was  a  request  that  the  panel  ‘recognize  the 
importance  of  homeownership  and  charity  in  American 
society.’  Some  analysts  have  concluded  that  the 
Administration’s  statement  indicate[d]  its  support  for 
preserving the mortgage interest deduction along with all of 
the other homeownership tax incentives.269 
In addition, the tax laws reflect “the extraordinary — probably 
unique — centrality of the nonprofit sector in American social and 
economic  life.”270  In  terms  of  tax  preferences,  the  importance  of 
nonprofit organizations in American life is reflected in the income, 
estate,  and  gift  tax  deductions  for  charitable  contributions.271  The 
perceived  importance  of  charity  in  American  society  is  not  only 
reflected  in  the  quotation  above  from  President  Bush’s  executive 
order establishing his tax reform panel, but also in the tax reform plan 
that President Reagan proposed some twenty years earlier. In his 1985 
plan,  President  Reagan  immunized  the  deduction  for  charitable 
contributions  from  reform  efforts  on  the  ground  that,  like  the 
mortgage interest deduction, it too is “central to American values” —

Perhaps  less  obviously  to  some,  the  tax  laws  reflect  not  only 
American dreams but also some unpleasant American realities. Given 
a long history of de jure and de facto discrimination on the basis of 
race, it is no wonder that “[a]n air of discomfort has always permeated

discomfort  surrounding  discussions  of  both  race  and  gender 
discrimination can be detected in the tax laws.

basis of race and gender would seem to have made it abundantly clear 
that invidious discrimination in employment is neither an ordinary nor

for discrimination on the basis of race or gender are required to pay 
tax on those damages while their employers are permitted to deduct 
those  same  damage  payments  as  ordinary  and  necessary  business 
expenses.276 Drawing on tax expenditure analysis, Karen Brown has 
argued that taxing the employee on these damages constitutes a tax 
penalty  (i.e.,  the  employee  is  overtaxed  because  she  is  denied  a 
deduction  for  the  costs  associated  with  producing  income  in  a 
discriminatory workplace) while permitting an employer “a deduction 
for expenses connected to discriminatory conduct seems a reward.”277 
When prohibitions against discrimination are juxtaposed with these 
tax preferences and penalties, we can clearly see how the law mirrors 
societal  discomfort  regarding  racial  and  gender  discrimination  by 
sending “mixed messages.”278 
Likewise (and perhaps more obviously), the privileging of the 
different-sex married couple and the so-called traditional family in 
American society — as well as the closely associated culture war over 
same-sex marriage — are all reflected in the pervasive importance of 
marital status in the tax laws.279 Marital status (and sexual orientation) 
impact not only such structural provisions as the determination of the 
taxable unit,280 but also the meting out of tax preferences such as the 
 
racially discriminatory admissions policy on the ground that it was not “charitable” 
and, in support of that decision, noting that, “[o]ver the past quarter of a century,

Orders attest a firm national policy to prohibit racial segregation and discrimination

differently based on their marital status and sexual orientation — with

The longstanding presence and important expressive function of 
tax expenditures together betray the quixotic nature of the battle to 
achieve a more just tax system by closing tax loopholes in an effort to

imagination and highly politically charged, notwithstanding academic 
assumptions and protestations that it is (or, at the very least, ought to 
be) technical, neutral, and apolitical.286 Because tax law touches so 
many  areas  of  so  many  people’s  lives,  it  has  come  to  serve  an 
important expressive function. We use tax preferences and penalties 
as a means of (consciously or unconsciously) expressing who we are — 
and, in some cases, a view of how we would like to develop and whom 
we  would  like  to  become.  Thus,  as  illustrated  above,  whether  in 
arguments about the role of marriage in American society or as a 
symbol of the American dream, tax law often plays an important 
cultural role. Given this reality, the goal of tax reform should not be to 
eradicate tax expenditures from the Internal Revenue Code but to 
rethink and rehabilitate them so that they better reflect who we are 
and how we would like to develop as a society. 
C.  “Reforming” Tax Expenditures 
1.  Beginning a Public Discussion 
With a starting point more grounded in reality, we can shift our 
focus  away  from  eliminating  tax  expenditures  (in  an  effort  to 
approximate a theoretically perfect tax base) and toward reforming 
our tax system as it actually operates (in an effort to reduce manifest 
injustice and advance human development).287 A key first step toward 
this end is to undertake a truly public discussion of what types of lives 
we value and why we have reason to value them.288 In other words, 
 
to ensure both the right choice of institutions as well as the emergence of 
appropriate actual behaviour on the part of everyone, making individual 
and social psychology thoroughly dependent on a kind of political ethics. 
Rawls’s approach, developed with admirable consistency and skill, does 
involve a formulaic and drastic simplification of a huge and multi-faceted 
task — that of combining the operation of the principles of justice with the 
actual behaviour of people — which is central to practical reasoning about 
social justice. This is unfortunate since it can be argued that the relationship 
between social institutions and actual — as opposed to ideal — individual 
behaviour cannot but be critically important for any theory of justice that is 
aimed at guiding social choice towards social justice.

focusing on the importance of agency and democratic participation to 
the human development approach,289 we need to work together to set 
our own agenda for advancing our development. An important part of 
this discussion will involve addressing the equitable distribution and 
sustainability of our extant and future development. That is, we must 
particularly focus our attention on (1) how the disadvantaged in our 
society are now faring and (2) how our decisions today will impact 
future generations. 
In  keeping  with  the  holistic  view  of  the  human  development 
approach, there must necessarily be a broad discussion that can, in 
turn, form the basis for assessing the legal and nonlegal, tax and 
nontax steps that can be taken to achieve these goals and advance our 
development. The tax system will likely not be the sole means for 
achieving  these  goals,  but  it  certainly  will  have  a  role  to  play  in 
advancing our development.290 Accordingly, we should consider how 
the tax system might be used to further our development as well as 
how the role of the tax system coordinates with and either supports or 
enhances other legal and nonlegal measures to be taken to advance 
our development. 
Tax and nontax legal coordination is not as foreign a concept as 
one might think. In fact, in the wake of the passage of the Patient 
Protection and Affordable Care Act (Affordable Care Act),291 the 
Department of Treasury worked together with the Department of 
Labor  and  the  Department  of  Health  and  Human  Services  “to 
develop  regulations  and  other  administrative  guidance  that  will 
respond to questions and assist stakeholders with implementation” of 
the health care reform legislation.292 In developing certain standards, 
the Affordable Care Act even explicitly required consultation with “a 
working  group  composed  of  representatives  of  health  insurance-
related  consumer  advocacy  organizations,  health  insurance  issuers, 
 
political system is being warped by the influence of big money, and that the warping is 
getting worse as the wealth of a few grows ever larger?”). 
  289  See, e.g., supra text accompanying notes 99, 112, and 115–118. 
  290  As should by now be clear, the purpose here is not to advocate achieving 
social justice through the tax system rather than through direct expenditures or other 
means. Instead, the purpose is to work with the tax system as it already exists and to 
reform and improve upon it. The tax law clearly has a role to play in discussions of 
human  development  and  social  justice.  I  am  merely  recognizing  that  role  and 
embracing it.

effort to advance human development is not a lofty aspiration; it is 
already happening. 
2.  An Example of an Area Ripe for Discussion 
Without in any way preempting the necessary public discussion 
and further recognizing that my purpose here is no more than to shift 
the focus of tax reform discourse, I would simply like to provide one 
example of an area that appears ripe for inclusion in this discussion. I 
will also offer a few thoughts on proposals that we might entertain 
when considering the role that the tax system (and, more particularly, 
provisions that could be classified as tax expenditures) might play in 
advancing human development in this area. 
The area that I have in mind is housing. It comes to mind because, 
as  mentioned  above,  in  2004  the  outlay  equivalent  for  the  home 
mortgage interest deduction, which is just one of the tax provisions 
encouraging  homeownership,295  far  exceeded  the  outlays  of  the 
Department  of  Housing  and  Urban  Development.296  This  large 
component of federal housing policy (or lack thereof)297 has come 
under fire for failing to actually encourage homeownership and for 
being regressive by disproportionately aiding those who least need 
help;298 for disproportionately benefiting white taxpayers over African 
Americans  and  Latino/as;299  for  having  “a  close  connection  to 
 
  293  Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act § 1001, 124 Stat. at 130, 132; see 
I.R.S. REG-140038-10, 2011-42 I.R.B. 537, 539 (proposed Aug. 22, 2011) (to be 
codified at 26 C.F.R. §§ 54, 602) (mentioning these consultative efforts).

proliferating [urban] sprawl”;300and, in its home equity indebtedness 
provision,  for  “amount[ing]  to  ‘a  house-sized  credit  card’  for 
‘consumer-type purchases, the very evil that the interest provisions of 
the 1986 tax act were designed to eliminate.’”301 
  If we were to put people — and particularly those among us 
who are disadvantaged — at the center of discussions about housing, 
we might not so narrowly focus on homeownership. For example, 
rates of homeownership for African  Americans and Latino/as are 
significantly below those of whites,302 and a recent study found that 
homeownership rates for transgender individuals in California were 
far below the state average.303 Not everyone will either wish to or have 
the  means  to  purchase  their  own  home.  Perhaps  a  broader  focus 
would  lead  us  to  conclude  that  what  we  value  is  not  just 
homeownership, but access to safe, affordable, accessible, sustainable, 
and stable housing. 
Certainly, we could implement a coordinated set of programs that 
would  aid  individuals  —  and  particularly  the  disadvantaged  —  in 
gaining access to safe, affordable, accessible, sustainable, and stable 
housing.  The  tax  system  could  play  a  role  in  achieving  this  goal, 
especially as it relates to affordability. Among the reforms of existing 
tax preferences and proposals for new tax preferences that one could 
imagine  being  offered  for  consideration  (either  separately  or  in 
combination) as a means of achieving this goal are: 
1.  Recognizing  that  one  of  the  biggest  hurdles  to 
homeownership is the inability to cover the up-front costs of

tax-deferred savings account for first-time homebuyers the 
proceeds of which must be used to purchase a home.305 
2. Recognizing that not all individuals will (or even wish to) 
become homeowners along with the existing discrimination in 
favor of homeowners and against renters in our tax laws,306 we 
might consider adopting a refundable renter’s credit based on 
the  models  employed  by  some  states  (e.g.,  Minnesota’s 
renter’s  property  tax  refund  program  or  New  Jersey’s 
property tax deduction/credit), which attempt to distribute 
property tax relief more equitably to both homeowners and 
renters.307 
3.  Recognizing  that  the  lower  rates  of  minority 
homeownership are due to a long and continuing history of 
discriminatory housing-related practices (e.g., redlining and 
reverse redlining),308 we might choose not to eliminate the

for renters who wish to become homeowners).

two-thirds of all returns that reflected an adjusted gross income of less than $50,000

slightly more than 25% of the returns claiming the home mortgage interest deduction.

homeownership — a proposal that would both redress this 
history of discrimination and encourage more racially diverse 
neighborhoods.311 
5.  Recognizing  the  importance  of  the  sustainability  of 
development, we might consider Roberta Mann’s proposal to 
replace the home mortgage interest deduction (and perhaps 
extend that proposal to replacing the deduction for property 
taxes as well) with a refundable shelter credit that would be 
comprised of (i) a base amount tied to median home prices 
and (ii) a “location efficiency premium” for homes located 
close to public transportation, both of which would tend to 
discourage urban sprawl.312 
Naturally,  which  of  these  (or  other)  proposals  are  ultimately 
adopted would depend on the course of the initial public discussion 
and the subsequent tailoring of any tax proposals both to meet the 
chosen goals for our development and to coordinate with any nontax 
proposals for meeting those goals. As a result, full elaboration of these 
tax proposals is both premature and beyond the scope of this article. 
It is worth underscoring that housing is only one area where the 
tax  system  might  play  a  role  in  advancing  human  development.313 
Other tax preferences might be reformed or created for the purpose 
of advancing human development in other areas (e.g., a refundable 
tax credit to ease the financial burden on those who take unpaid leave 
under the Family and Medical Leave Act in order to care for a loved 
one or new child).314 Moreover, once we recognize that our tax laws 
mirror the society that created them, there is no reason to limit our 
horizons to examining only those provisions that can be classified as 
tax preferences.315 After all, the local culture can express itself both

  312  Mann, supra note 250, at 1393–96. 
  313  Though a full discussion of this point is beyond the scope of this article, taking 
a people-centered approach to tax reform might provide reason for abandoning the 
artificial political constraint that seems to have accompanied talk of tax reform since 
1986 — revenue neutrality. Shaviro, supra note 220, at 817–19. For instance, a focus 
on sustainable development might require tax reform to raise additional revenue so 
that development today does not come at the expense of the development of future 
generations. See supra text accompanying notes 134–138. 
  314  29 U.S.C. § 2612 (2011). 
  315  Indeed, one of the peripheral benefits of adopting a people-centered approach 
to tax reform is that we can completely bypass unproductive debates regarding the 
line between structural and nonstructural tax provisions, which have proven to be the INFANTI.FINAL.DOC  10/23/2012  6:03 PM 
2012]  Tax Reform Discourse  267 
through structural provisions and tax preferences and penalties.316 To 
draw again upon an earlier example,317 the influence of culture on 
structural provisions can be seen in the choice of the different-sex 
married  couple  as  a  taxable  unit  (as  well  as  in  the  occasional 
expansion  of  that  taxable  unit  to  the  boundaries  of  the  so-called 
traditional family through the inclusion of the couple’s children).318 
We can — and should — consider ways that the tax laws as a whole — 
both the structural provisions and any putative departures from the 
chosen baseline319 — can advance human development. 
V.  CONCLUSION 
The need to focus on people as people, and not as numbers, is, as 
Mahbub ul Haq and Amartya Sen have both noted, far from a new 
idea. In a sense, it represents a return to seeing the world through the 
innocent eyes of a child. Thus, in closing, I would like to end with a 
quote from my favorite book to read to my daughter before she goes 
to bed at night, Le Petit Prince (translation below): 
Si je vous ai raconté ces détails sur l’astéroïde B 612 et si je 
vous ai confié son numéro, c’est à cause des grandes personnes. 
Les grandes personnes aiment les chiffres. Quand vous leur 
parlez d’un nouvel ami, elles ne vous questionnent jamais sur 
l’essentiel. Elles ne vous disent jamais: « Quel est le son de sa 
voix? Quels sont les jeux qu’il préfère? Est-ce qu’il collectionne 
les  papillons?  »  Elle  vous  demandent:  «  Quel  âge  a-t-il? 
Combien a-t-il de frères? Combien pèse-t-il? Combien gagne 
son père? » Alors seulement elles croient le connaître. Si vous 
dites aux grandes personnes: « J’ai vu une belle maison en 
briques roses, avec des géraniums aux fenêtres et des colombes 
sur  le  toit. . .  »  elles  ne  parviennent  pas  à  s’imaginer  cette 
maison. Il faut leur dire: « J’ai vu une maison de cent mille

group of tax provisions should be spared scrutiny because they are “structural” or 
part of some “normative” tax baseline.

  320  ANTOINE DE SAINT-EXUPERY, LE PETIT PRINCE 19–20 (1946). Here is my own 
translation: “If I have told you these details about asteroid B612 and if I have 
confided in you its number, it’s because of the grown ups. Grown ups love numbers. 
When you talk to them about a new friend, they never ask you about the important 
things. They never ask you: ‘What does his voice sound like? What are his favorite 
games? Does he collect butterflies?’ They ask you: ‘How old is he? How many 
brothers does he have? How much does he weigh? How much does his father make?’ 
Only in that way do they think they know him. If you tell grown ups, ‘I saw a beautiful 
pink brick house with geraniums in the windows and doves on the roof . . .’ they 
cannot manage to picture that house. It’s necessary to tell them: ‘I saw a 100,000 franc
