Abstract: Trying to find solutions for trivalent durability (economic / financial, 
social  and  environmental  issues)  is  becoming  more  and  more  a  preoccupied 
concerns  of  many  specialists.  In  this  paper  we  make  some  references  to  the 
Romanian researchers focus on the issue of sustainable development, especially 
with Professor Ionel Bostan, which operates at the universities of Iasi and Suceava 
(RO). His work, published in several scientific journals indexed in international 
databases, addresses issues related to promoting natural capital, the right of future 
generations  to  a  healthy  environment,  eco-investments,  green  tourism,  green 
energy,  environmental  audit,  economy  and  public  health  financing  and  then, 
because "People are at the forefront of sustainable development”, issues related to 
the human factor. 
 
Key word: sustainable development; natural capital; human capital; health and 
well-being; budgetary resources; financing biodiversity; control / audit of public 
funds.
