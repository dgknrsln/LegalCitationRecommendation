Information  Policy for the  Library of Babel
The universe (which others call the Library) is composed of an indefinite, per-
haps infinite number of hexagonal galleries.
-Jorge Luis Borges'
BORGES'S 1941 SHORT STORY THE LIBRARY OF BABEL  DESCRIBES an unbelievably large
library containing all possible books. Within the "total"2 and "endless"3 reaches of
the Library,"[t]here  [is]  no personal problem, no world problem, whose eloquent
solution [does] not exist-somewhere"  but also "[flor every rational line or forth-
right statement there are leagues of senseless cacophony, verbal nonsense, and inco-
herency."5 As  Borges describes  it, the Library is the greatest imaginable source of
information: it contains "The Vindications-books of apologie and prophecies that
would vindicate for all time the actions of every person in the universe  and that
held wondrous arcana for men's futures."6 But the Library's vastness and disorgani-
zation also make it almost completely useless: "[T]he chance of a man's finding his
own Vindication  . . . can be calculated  to be zero."'  The image of the Library is
haunting and suggestive. What would we  do if we  took it at face  value? In  this
Essay, I propose to do just that: set out a  few principles of sensible information
policy for the Library of Babel.
I.  THE LIBRARY
Suppose that we were advisors to the Federal Library Commission, an arm of the
duly constituted government of the Library of Babel. In our capacity as lawyers and
information  policy  experts, we  have been  asked  to suggest  ways  to advance  the

public interest of the Library. What might we propose? The following propositions
strike me as sound bases  for the work of the Commission:
The public interest means readers' interest.
Intellectual property policy is accustomed to speaking  of a trade-off between au-
thors'  interests and a public  interest in access to  information.  In the Library of
Babel, however,  there are  no authors. Borges states as an "axiom[ ]'8 that "[t]he
Library has existed ab aeternitate .... [It] can only be the handiwork of a god."9 All
possible books already exist; no further incentive is  required to bring  them into
being. Nor does any book contain any expression of an author's unique personality;
every book in the Library is equally anonymous. "The certainty that everything has
already  been  written  annuls  us, or  renders  us phantasmal."'"  In contrast,  these
books are of immense potential value to readers, some of it individual (the Vindi-
cations)  and some collective  ("The universe  was justified;  the universe  suddenly
became congruent with the unlimited width and breadth of humankind's hope.")"
This "intact and secret  treasure"2 is a treasure because  it can be appropriated by
readers,  not  because  it  encourages  authors  or  reflects  the  imprint  of  their
personality.
Or, looked at another way, the Federal Library Commission must serve the in-
habitants of the Library (or "librarians,"  as Borges calls them). There is no one else
for it to serve. The inhabitants, however, encounter the Library first and foremost
as readers. Indeed, their search for information in its stacks (or the repudiation of
that search) is the principal act that gives their own lives meaning. They search for
their Vindications,  for "the books of the Crimson Hexagon-books  smaller  than
natural books, books omnipotent, illustrated, and magical."'3 On the shelves some-
where are "the detailed history of the future, the autobiographies of the archangels
• ..the treatise  Bede could have written  (but did not) on the mythology of the
Saxon people,"'4 and other informational treasures beyond measure. We do our job
well if we help our constituents find the true and beautiful books and steer them
clear of the false and ugly ones.
Infrastructure matters.
Access to knowledge always depends on access to knowledge infrastructure. Borges
details the arrangements of the books on shelves and the configuration of the hex-
agonal galleries of the Library because these facts matter. The numinous promise of

the Library is that any book could actually be found within it; we could make the
journey to the proper hexagon, look on the proper shelf, and hold it in our hands.
The "spiral  staircase, which  winds upward and downward  into the remotest dis-
tance,"'"  the vestibules linking the hexagons, and the shelves are infrastructure; they
make it possible to reach and use the books. So too, more indirectly, are the sleep-
ing compartments  and  toilets off the vestibules,  and the "spherical  fruits' 6 that
illuminate the galleries; they are infrastructure that make it feasible for us to live in
(and thus to consult) the Library.
We have  made some  strides  in improving the  Library's infrastructure:  Borges
refers in passing to "a hexagon in circuit 15-94,"'"  and we at the Commission might
take credit for the numbering scheme. But on the whole, we're falling far short of
what we could accomplish. The light from the bulbs  is "insufficient,  and unceas-
ing"Y;'  some of our constituents "talk about a staircase that nearly killed them-
some steps were  missing . . ."" Even  more  troublingly, basic  education  in the
'. 
Library may be breaking down: "I know districts in which the young people...
cannot read a letter."2  Really helping citizens make full use of the Library requires
provisioning the technologies they use to access it, and also helping them acquire
the media literacies they use to make  sense of it. We can help with both.
Censorship is usually irrelevant.
Some of the books in the Library are dangerous in themselves: "There is no combi-
nation of characters one can make-dhcmrlchtdj, for example-that the divine Li-
brary has not foreseen and that in one or more of its secret tongues does not hide a
terrible significance."'  Others are dangerous because they divert us from the books
we seek: "thousands and thousands of false catalogs,"22 the "proof of the falsity of
the true catalog,""  "some perfidious version of his own [Vindication]."2" In the face
of these dangers, some "Purifiers" have turned to censorship:
They would invade the hexagons, show credentials that were not always false,
leaf disgustedly through a volume, and condemn entire walls of books. It is to
their hygienic, ascetic rage that we lay the senseless loss of millions of volumes.25

VOL.  3 NO.  1 2008INFORMATION  POLICY  FOR THE LIBRARY  OF BABEL
In the abstract, because  every book is  meaningful to  some possible  reader, it
might seem that purging a volume is an unpardonable crime. But the same consid-
erations that make individual authorship moot also tend to make individual cen-
sorship moot. (Destroying a book is just the mirror image of creating one.)  The
Library endures far above our poor power to add-or detract. As Borges reminds
us, in the vastness of the Library, "any reduction by human hands must be infini-
tesimal"6 and for any book "there are always several hundred thousand imperfect
facsimiles-books that differ by no more than a single letter, or a comma."27 Cen-
sors who rip a book from our hands have harmed us, to be sure, as have those who
burn down so much of the Library as to make appreciably harder the task of find-
ing shelves with books to read. But on the long view, any one person is so insignifi-
cantly small when compared with the treasure-house that is the Library of Babel
that a few depredations here and there do not much affect either the availability of
any given  information or the average  librarian's search through the galleries. (In-
deed, if Borges's final suspicion is correct, and the Library is "unlimited but peri-
odic,"2"  it contains an infinite number of copies  of each book, and censorship is
infinitesimally irrelevant even within the Library's holdings of that precise title.)
The problem is access, not creation.
Here we come to the crux of the matter. There is no difficulty in ensuring that the
Library contains a (near) copy of any book. The difficulty lays in our being able to
make use of the books that the Library contains. It follows from the Library's ency-
clopedic collection and the disorder of its stacks that one browsing the shelves must
face "the formless  and chaotic nature  of virtually all books."29 The book that is
intelligible to us is the rare exception. Borges speaks of a few: one that repeats the
letters "M C V" ° over and over; one that is gibberish except for the single phrase "0
Time thy pyramids";3 one "as jumbled as all the others, but containing almost two
pages of homogenous  lines."32  The consequence  of this  rarity is  that knowledge
about intelligible books becomes a valuable, nearly mystical commodity. The book
containing "0 Time thy pyramids" is "much consulted";33 the one with two whole
pages of sense provided grist for linguists and philosophers for almost a "century."34
Similarly, Borges makes much of the physical difficulties of searching for books. I
have alluded to the dangers  of broken stairs; there are entire zones of the Library
that are beset by "[e]pidemics, heretical discords, pilgrimages that inevitably degen-

erate into brigandage .. ..""T he narrator will die only "a few leagues from the
hexagon  where I was born."36 The atomic useful informational  artifact of the Li-
brary is  not the book;  it is the book in  hand. We must know where to find the
book, we must have some inkling of its contents, and we must be able to make the
(potentially quite long) journey to it.  Getting the information into the hands of
those who need it is where all the hard work lies.
The Library is nearly but not completely useless.
And it is hard work indeed. The books are arranged in  no order we can  under-
stand. Nor do we have any usable  index. The letters on the outside of each book
"neither indicate nor prefigure what the pages inside will say."37 The "faithful cata-
log of the Library"3  exists within it somewhere, but we do not know where,  nor
how to distinguish it from the "thousands and thousands of false catalogs."39 Little
wonder that "[iinfidels claim that the rule in the Library is not 'sense'  but 'non-
sense"'40 and that "[o]ne blasphemous sect proposed that the searches be discontin-
ued and that all men shuffle letters and symbols ... .""T he Library of Babel seems
like a pure and perfect example  of information overload.
But it is not. Borges swears that the Library "includes not a single absolute piece
of nonsense. '42N or is it completely disordered. The narrator has seen a book titled
"The Plaster Cramp"3 and one titled "Combed Thunder,"4' along with two Vindica-
tions, "which refer to persons in the future, persons perhaps not imaginary.'4  Such
finds (along with the previously mentioned book of "M C V's and a book with two
pages of "a Samoyed-Lithuanian  dialect of Guarani,  with inflections from classical
Arabic"46) are significant instances of order. Once found, they stay found. Our use-
ful knowledge  of the Library's contents is gradually increasing. It may take eons,
but even random explorations  will slowly build a sub-Library of useful books we
actually have seen. The more librarians we enlist in the search, finding and tagging
books and sharing what they have found, the faster this sub-Library will grow.
And we should perhaps be optimistic about the search itself. Some of the books
Borges mentions are extreme statistical improbabilities.  One who spent his whole
life flipping through books in a truly random library would be profoundly unlikely

to find books displaying that much structure. A book containing nothing but end-
less repetitions of "M C V" may contain less information than a book of English
text, but it is  also far  rarer.  Unless Borges,  through some kind of narrative  an-
thropic principle, is inordinately lucky among librarians, the most natural inference
is  that the Library is in  fact ever so  slightly non-random.  Its shelves  show just
enough structure that a "faithful catalog" might just barely propound some system
by which books are slotted into their assigned places. If only we could lay our hands
on that catalog.
II.  THE BOOK-MAN
One idea in the story is particularly intriguing: the Book-Man.47 "On some shelf in
some hexagon, it was argued, there must exist a book that is the cipher and perfect
compendium of all other books, and some librarian must have examined that book;
this librarian is analogous to a god."4
How would our job working for the Federal Library Commission change  if we
had a Book-Man to contend with? Why would the other librarians consider him
"analogous to a god?"
The Book-Man makes the Library useful.
With only a little bit of reading between Borges's lines, it's possible to believe that a
Book-Man would utterly transform our informational lives. The Book-Man is the
one who has seen the "cipher and perfect compendium."  If we identify this "total
book"49 with the "faithful catalog"5" mentioned previously, the nature of its perfec-
tion becomes clear. There is no way we could compress the contents of all possible
books into a single book, but a single book could  lay bare the Library's  hidden
immanent order. Asking the Book-Man questions about what he has learned from
the faithful catalog is the next best thing to consulting it ourselves. He would thus
not be particularly knowledgeable  about the actual contents  of the books in the
Library, but would instead be a guide to the Library's shelving patterns.
"Where can I find the lost books of Tacitus?" we might ask him, or "Where can I
find a book that explains the significance of '0  Time thy pyramids?"' Given the
dense complexity of a total book, the imperfections  of human  memory, and the
vagueness  of our questions,  I suspect  that the Book-Man's knowledge  would be
notably partial. Pinpointing a specific book seems unlikely; instead, he would prob-
ably direct us to a shelf, or a hexagon, with the claim that it was likely to contain a
book relevant to our question. Often it would; sometimes it would not. But "often"
would still be a radical improvement on what we could do without his help. Borges

reminds us  that "for a  book to  exist, it is  sufficient that it be possible."'  In the
Library of Babel,  any question that  has an answer  will therefore  have an answer
somewhere on its shelves, and the Book-Man can usually direct us to that answer.
In short, the Book-Man could  solve our access problem.
An impostor could not pretend to be the Book-Man.
The Book-Man's task is insanely difficult. Any librarian could make recommenda-
tions, only to have them shown up as useless after his disgruntled questioners re-
turned from their searches with their hands empty. A librarian who had chanced
into seeing a few noteworthy volumes might be able to put on a good exhibition.
But answering questions about the locations of books on arbitrary topics is a hard
problem; there is no way to do it reliably unless one really does have  information
about all books. Simply by asking for help finding books on sufficiently many ran-
dom topics, we could with arbitrarily  high probability expose as a fraud any pre-
tender to the title of Book-Man.  The impossibility of a false Book-Man,  perhaps,
justifies the "sect that worshiped that distant librarian"52 and the desperate searches
the narrator and others have made for "the idolized secret hexagon that sheltered
Him."53 Out of all the religious and delirious schemes the librarians pursue, this is
one of the least mystical-it really is possible  to distinguish success  from failure.
The Book-Man could keep secrets from us and we'd never know.
A putative Book-Man cannot pretend to be better at his art than he really is. The
reverse is emphatically not true. A librarian, looking through the faithful catalog,
might  decide that  the burden  of being a Book-Man  was too heavy  to bear.  He
places the book back on the shelf, slowly backs away, ascends to the next hexagon,
and  never says a word  to anyone else. Another librarian, suspecting some  secret
knowledge, asks him about the lost books of Tacitus. Our renunciant names a hexa-
gon utterly at random. Short of unspeakably barbaric acts, there is no way we can
convince an unwilling Book-Man  to assume the mantle, and thus no way we can
spot one unless he wishes to be spotted.
A disturbing corollary follows. We have  noted that even a true Book-Man will
give vague and sometimes unhelpful directions. There is nothing to stop him from
underplaying his powers a little. We ask him about the lost books of Tacitus, and he
claims not to know (when of course he does). Unless we should happen to stumble
across the books ourselves (an  extraordinarily  unlikely event in the Library),  we
might never suspect anything is amiss. We ask him for a Vindication, but he points
us to a perfidious version of it, instead. We discover the falsehood just in time, but
when we confront the miscreant who pointed us to it, he pleads the uncertainties of

his art, the briefness of his glance at the catalog. Who are we to question his story?
He has, after all, been wrong on plenty of other occasions. He might even have the
catalog secreted in a nearby hexagon, on a shelf otherwise occupied only by gibber-
ish; all those mistakes are just an act; we'd never know.
The problem  is  that the  Book-Man's quasi-mystical  knowledge  is  based on  a
source inaccessible to us, surrounded with inherent uncertainties, and subject to his
personal discretion.  Any  pattern  we  think we  perceive  in  his  answers  could be
sandbagging, or it could be an artifact of an imperfect human attempt to process
the faithful catalog's trans-Byzantine organizational system, or it could be an una-
voidable glitch introduced by the question-asking process. The Book-Man's system
is a knowledge expander: he starts from a short fragment of information (e.g. "the
lost books of Tacitus") and makes a guess as to which much larger body of informa-
tion it best refers. He could be wrong. As  Borges notes, the Library is a  place of
linguistic diversity: "[A]  few miles to the right, our language devolves into dialect
and . . . ninety floors above, it becomes incomprehensible."54 Nor are words them-
selves fixed: "[I]n  some [languages],  the symbol 'library'  possesses the correct defi-
nition 'everlasting,  ubiquitous system of hexagonal galleries,' while a library-the
thing-is a loaf of bread or a pyramid or something else, and the six words that
define it themselves have other definitions.""5  The speaker of such a language who
asks the Book-Man for what she thinks is a book about baking will not be happy to
be directed to a book on the architecture of the Library. Further, the very nature of
our search is that we ourselves don't entirely know what's within the covers of the
book we're looking for when we ask the question, so that the question could plausi-
bly refer to any of trillions of trillions of possible books. The Book-Man  must guess
at all these ambiguities. ("You who read me-are you certain you understand my
language?"56) Within the space we must allow him to make those guesses, he could
hide any number of bodies.
The Book-Man can play favorites.
Perhaps most  troublingly of all, the Book-Man  might  reserve his trickiest, most
misleading advice for his secret enemies.  He's helpful  often enough that his ene-
mies trust him utterly, but he's just saving up for the one great bum steer that will
end with them falling over a railing; "[their]  tomb will be the unfathomable air" 7
between the galleries; their bodies "will sink for ages, and will decay and dissolve in
the wind engendered by [their]  fall, which shall be  infinite."8 The rest of us will
never know. Even if they recognize the trap and warn us of a  dire fate  narrowly

averted,  their  claims will be anecdotal, sporadic,  hard to recognize  as a pattern,
easily explained away.
The Book Man doesn't even have to give different answers to the same question
to different  people  (if he  did, we  might be able  to lay bare  the betrayal). All he
needs to do is to select particular topics on which his directions will be misleading.
People naturally ask him about such a wide assortment of topics that he can target
people he doesn't like by giving bad suggestions on the topics that matter to them
but not to other people. Thanks to his dislike of the cut of your jib, you'll never
find your Vindication; it's nowhere near the hexagon he recommended. If I ask him
about your Vindication,  I get the same recommendation.  But when  either of us
asks about my Vindication, the Book-Man  can point us not just to the right hexa-
gon, but to the right shelf. He's given the two of us exactly the same answers, while
still using his unconstrained  discretion to favor me over you.
The more Book-Men, the better.
One  Book-Man  may be  forgetful.  But suppose we  had two?  We could put each
question to the both of them. By combining forces, the Book-Men could find any
book that either one of them alone could find. Given the variety of reading styles, it
seems likely that each of them would have understood the total book in a different
way, have absorbed different ideas. Once we have multiple Book-Men, the variabil-
ity of their knowledge of the Library becomes not a weakness, but a strength. The
more divergent  their thinking,  the less likely they are  to  make exactly  the same
mistakes-and thus the more likely we are to find the books we seek.
If we separate the Book-Men,  and have them answer our questions  simultane-
ously from different hexagons, we  can even fix some  of the trust problems. This
protocol  makes it hard for them to collude; any rigged answers would need to be
agreed  upon  in advance. With a sufficient  diversity of questions  and a  sufficient
intensity of follow-ups, we can be statistically quite confident that any given com-
mon answer is not the result of some diabolical scheme on the part of the Book-
Men. By comparing their answers against  each other, and against the contents of
the shelves, we can also make bad advice more visible. If one Book-Man directs us
to a  pack of lies, nothing may seem  amiss. But if one Book-Man  directs us to a
book that proclaims the exact opposite of the book recommended by the other, our
suspicions should be aroused. The advice  of the second  Book-Man, by giving us
another picture of what's out there, helps us check-up on the first-and vice versa.
Not only is it harder for one Book-Man to steer us awry, but it's harder for him
to slack. If over time we find one Book-Man more reliable than the other, we can
start checking first the shelves he selects, demoting the other a few notches from his
god-like status. Thus,  all in all,  the competition  among  the two Book-Men  im-
proves the overall quality of our searches, makes it harder for them to mislead us
(and  thus makes us more trusting of them), and creates an incentive  for them to
work hard at giving good advice. This argument, of course, generalizes to the case
VOL. 3 NO.  1 2008INFORMATION  POLICY FOR THE LIBRARY  OF BABEL
of more than two Book-Men.  It's not a complete solution to the problems of the
Library, but it's a step in the right direction.
III.  THE INTERNET
As it announces in its very first sentence,  The Library of Babel is an allegory for the
universe.  This essay has also treated it as an allegory-and  an anachronistic  and
transparent  one at that. For "Library of Babel," read "Internet." For "book," read
"Wvb  site." And for "Book-Man,"  read "search engine." It's almost a clich6 to assert
that the Internet is like a vast library, that it causes problems of information over-
load, or that it contains both treasures and junk in vast quantities. Looking  at it
through the lens of Borges's Library amplifies these themes to their utter limit, and
thus makes them  fresh  again. The ten principles  set forth  above are  completely
serious. Here they are again, using the proper terminology:
1. The public interest means readers' interest. This may be the most surprising
claim about the  Internet, but it is also the most important. In the Library, it is
trivially obvious. A decade or two from now, it will seem trivially obvious on the
Internet too. In an environment of extreme informational abundance, the principal
moral imperative is to get that information into the hands of the people who want
and need it. If the information production  problem has been solved, then the in-
formation-consuming public is properly the sole beneficiary of information policy.
2. Infrastructurem  atters. Not all information policy has to do directly with infor-
mation. Keeping the electronic infrastructure of the Internet up and running and
enabling it to grow is the single best thing that government has done for informa-
tion policy in the last two decades. Making sure that citizens have the literacies they
need to learn from  and to evaluate critically what  they find online is similarly a
basic task of information policy.
3. Censorshipi s usually irrelevant.W  hen information is overwhelmingly plentiful,
the  deck is  stacked against would-be  censors.  As many governments  and media
companies have learned, getting a particular file offline and keeping it offline is like
playing a constantly accelerating game of Whac-a-Mole. As offensive as some indi-
vidual  censorship  efforts  have  been, even  substantial  filtering systems  have  not
(thus far) crippled the Internet as a whole.
4. The problem is access, not creation. The divide between informational haves
and informational have-nots is wide. So is the gap of a different sort between those
who make information and those who need it. What we as the reading public most
need are reasonable, fail. and effective ways to get our hands on the vast treasure-
houses of knowledge  tia.t  already exist.
5.  The Internet is nearly, but not completely useless. There are  billions of Web
pages. No one can possibly read them all, or even any significant fraction of them.
It's possible to be hopelessly lost in your own inbox. You can find interesting things
by browsing hyperlinks or by taking recommendations from friends of interesting
JOURNAL OF BUSINESS  & TECHNOLOGY  LAWJAMES GRIMMELMANN
things they have seen, but the natural infrastructure of the Internet provides almost
no useful structure for finding the information you need.
6 Search engines make the Internet useful. Information  overload demands good
filters. There are many technologies that pare down a vast universe of possibilities
into a smaller  higher-quality set, but search technologies  are special because they
are  responsive to  individual  users'  informational  requests. Good search  across a
sufficiently large knowledge base promotes autonomy by letting each person find
and use the information she herself knows that she needs.  Search transforms the
Internet  from  a  confusing  mess  to  the  most  useful  informational  resource  of
all time.
7. An impostor could not pretend to have a good search engine. Search is hard. You
can't provide good search unless you really have crawled  large swathes of the In-
ternet and done something intelligent with what you've seen.  It's also somewhat
verifiable. If a search engine gives junk results, people will recognize that the results
are junk. It's easy to test a search engine out on the topic most important to you.
Thus, there are substantial  meritocratic components in people's use of search en-
gines, and we should be reasonably confident that a successful search engine really
does offer recommendations  that people find useful much of the time.
8. Search engines could keep secrets from us and we'd never know. Precisely because
search is hard, it's easy to play games with a search algorithm. Merely by inspecting
results, there's no way to prove that a search engine has demoted a site in its rank-
ings for illegitimate  reasons. There are just too many other reasons  why the site
might appear where it does. We can probably count on search engines not to be
deliberately  incompetent,  but  for any given  ranking,  distinguishing incompetent
from malicious from opinionated from truth-telling is a nearly impossible task for
anyone except the search engine's own programmer. This is not a problem that can
be completely solved through pure market forces.
9. Search engines can play favorites. This point is really just a special case of the
last. So many different considerations  go into a search engine algorithm that some
degree of favoritism is inevitable. Whether consciously or unconsciously, the search
engine will be more useful to some users than to others. Equal access to search is
ultimately as important as equal access to other informational resources, and good
information policy will make sure that a reasonable baseline of search is available to
everyone.
10. The more search engines the better. These may seem like dire fears. But many
of them are  much less worrisome if there is effective competition among search
engines. The engines themselves can learn from what the others do right; users can
mix and match to optimize their searches. Comparisons can point out general areas
of trouble and police  against particular abuses. A diversity of search  engines will
favor individual  users'  ability to get the particular search services-and  thus the
information-they need.
VOL.  3 NO.  1 2008INFORMATION  POLICY FOR THE LIBRARY OF BABEL
The Library of Babel provides an exhilarating  and frightening  metaphor for the
Internet. Exhilarating because it reminds us that we are all now "the possessors of
an intact and secret treasure"59 of knowledge beyond compare. Frightening because
it reminds us that that knowledge is shut away in a "feverish  [place], whose random
volumes constantly  threaten to transmogrify  into others, so that they affirm  all
things, deny all things, and confound and confuse all things, like some mad and
hallucinating deity."'  Only the  god-like Book-Man, whose knowledge of the Li-
brary isa n "honor and wisdom and joy,""  can  make sense of it for  us. In the
Library of Babel, the Book-Man  is but a "superstition,"62 but on the Internet, his
name is Google.
