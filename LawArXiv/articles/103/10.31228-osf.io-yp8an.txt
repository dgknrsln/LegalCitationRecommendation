Systemically Significant Prices

ABSTRACT
Somepricesandindicesindomesticorglobalmarketstakeonparticularmarket-wide
importance. This can occur either because (i) they are associated with ubiquitous in-
puts to production, (ii) they are associated with highly popular asset classes, (iii) by
convention they tend to be used as benchmarks in determining other prices, or (iv)
some combination of the above. Examples include prevailing wage and salary rates,
certain energy and commodity prices, and such indices and borrowing rates as the
Standard&Poor’s 500,theFederal FundsRate, andtheLiborandEuriborinterbank
lendingratebenchmarks.
We call such prices and indices ‘systemically important’ prices and indices, or
‘SIPIs’. Over the long term, these prices and indices tend towards certain statistical
mean values that reﬂect determinants that can plausibly be treated as ‘fundamentals’,
bethesedemographic,technological,orglobal-quantity-rootedincharacter. Attimes,
however,SIPIscanmoveoutofalignmentwithmeanvaluesandassociatedfundamen-
tals owing to distortions stemming from missing information, recursive collective
action problems (including ‘noise’ trading and ‘herd’ behaviour), or even deliberately
manipulativebehaviouronthepartofinﬂuentialorcolludingmarketactors.

become commonplace that updated, macroprudential forms of market regulation
must now complement the more traditional, firm-focused microprudential forms of
regulation that prevailed before the crisis broke out.2 The ‘systemic stability’ of our
financial markets, in other words, is now recognized to be irreducible to the mere
‘safetyandsoundness’ofbanksandotherfinancialinstitutions,whileoldformsoffi-
nancial regulation are thus recognized as being in need of supplementation, even
thoughnotsimplesupplanting,bynewer,systemicallyfocusedforms.3
Our regulatory regime’s newfound appreciation of systemic significance is re-
flected not only much in post-crisis research and scholarship offered by academics,
centralbankresearchers,andothers,butalsoinpost-crisislegislationandregulation.
The Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act in the US, for
example, explicitly recognizes that some financial firms and market utilities are pos-
sessed of systemic significance, and so establishes a regime of ‘enhanced prudential
regulation’ towhichcertain ‘systemicallyimportant’firmsandutilities areto besub-
jected.4 Much bickering and dickering in New York and Washington accordingly
now concerns whether this or that firm or utility really ought to be designated sys-
temically important, and in consequence saddled with the putative burdens of en-
hancedregulation.5
Thisarticletakesclaimsoftheneedforenhancedprudentialregulationofsystem-
ically important firms and utilities at face value, but suggests there is at least one
other systemically significant variable that is in need of special treatment. These are
what we call ‘systemically important prices and indices,’ or ‘SIPIs.’ For a number of
reasonsthatweshallelaborate,SIPIsrenderfinancialmarketsvulnerabletomanyof

Ourplanofattackisasfollows.Thesection‘DesignationCriteria’firstelaborates
what we believe to render some prices and indices systemically significant, hence
what we believe make up for appropriate criteria in designating some prices or indi-
ces as SIPIs. We emphasize in particular (i) the ubiquity in production of that to
whichapriceorindexpertains,(ii)theubiquityofinvestmentincertainassetclasses
to which a price or index pertains, and (iii) the ubiquityof use of the price or index
inquestionasa‘benchmark’inotherpricingdecisions.Eachofthesecriteriaandany
combination thereof, we suggest, can render some prices or indices more systemi-
callysignificant—andhenceregulatorilysalient—thanothers.Eachalsoisconsistent,
we believe, with the criteria that Dodd–Frank elaborates as germane to the designa-
tionofcertainfinancialinstitutionsandmarketutilitiesasSIFIs.
Thesection‘SystemicVulnerabilities’turnstoelaboratingthesystemicvulnerabil-
itiestowhichSIPIscansubjectourfinancialmarkets.Wetrackthesebyreferenceto
specific characteristics of the processes pursuant to which the prices or indices in
question are generated. In some cases these processes involve (i) informational ad-
vantages or, relatedly, (ii) conflicts of interest, disproportionate market power, or
manipulative collusion opportunities available to certain ‘large’ or ‘clubby’ market
participants.7 In other cases, the price- or index-determinationprocesses in question
involve (iii) recursive collective action problems that afflict decentralized market
behaviour, depriving the markets in question of stable equilibria. Understanding the
specific vulnerabilities to which SIPIs subject markets by reference to the mechanics
of specific prices’ or indices’ determinations is critical, we argue, to the task of fram-

Thesection‘EnhancedRegulation’turnstoregulatorystrategy.Hereweelaborate
five broad, mutually complementary options available to regulators aiming to miti-
gate or modulate the risks to which SIPIs expose our financial markets. All but one
of these options is keyed to a particular dynamic of price- or index-determination.
The first and most generally applicable option is enhanced surveillance, pursuant to
which regulators pay special attention to the prices or indices in question and their
modesofdeterminationinordertoascertainwhetherandwhenregulatoryinterven-
tions are called for. The second option, responsive to asymmetric information, con-
flicted interest, and associated manipulation or collusion opportunities, is licensure
or pre-approval of the index or benchmark in question, with a view to ensuring that
the arbitrage and rent-extraction opportunities that it presents do not outweigh the
putative benefits that it offers. The third option, likewise responsive to asymmetric
information, conflicted interest and collusion, and also to individual firms’ market
power, is enhanced utility-style regulation—including in some cases participation by
regulators in the very ‘clubs’ or coalitions that aggregate and publish benchmark

prices or indices. The fourth option, responsive more particularly to market power
and potential collusion, is enhanced antitrust and anti-fraud regulation. Finally, the
fifth option, responsive to the recursive collective action problems that beset some
decentralized markets, is price maintenance—typically within some variably narrow-
orbroadband—throughopenmarketoperations(OMO).
Inboththe‘SystemicVulnerabilities’and‘EnhancedRegulation’sections,weaim
toretaincoherencewiththeSIFIandTitleVIIImarketutilityregimesestablishedby
Dodd–Frank for prices and indices over which the US has primary jurisdiction, and
coherencewiththeglobalfinancial-regulatoryarchitectureforpricesandindicesover
which the US lacks primary jurisdiction. Thus, we take the Financial Stability
OversightCouncil(FSOC)tobetheappropriate‘decider’wheredomesticSIPIdes-
ignation is concerned, then take the Federal Reserve Board (Fed) and at least one
appropriate ‘functional’ regulator—eg the Securities and Exchange Commission
(SEC) for certain securities prices, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission
(CFTC) and Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) for fuel oils and en-
ergy derivatives, etc—to be the appropriate developers of particular enhanced pru-
dential standards forparticular SIPIs over which theUS has primaryjurisdiction. By
the same token, we take international bodies such as the FSB, relevant European
Union (EU) institutions, or other domestic regulators such as Britain’s FCA to be
the appropriate designators and standards developers for SIPIs over which the US
lacksprimaryjurisdiction.
After discussing the transnational implications of our observations and tentative
recommendations, we conclude. Before proceeding, we emphasize that this explora-
toryarticledoesnotpurporttoofferafullyelaboratedandadoption-readyblueprint
for regulatory action. We are well aware of the many challenges that will face any
seriousefforttoinstituteacomprehensiveregimecoveringallsystemicallyimportant
prices and indices used in contemporary financial markets. As noted above, more-
over, there are already significant efforts underway in some jurisdictions, aimed at
dealing with at least one SIPI-related vulnerability - manipulation. We do not aim
here to critique or fundamentally shape these ongoing efforts. Our goal is both

foranalyzingtheiruniqueimportanceandpolicyimplications.

‘special’andaccordinglyworthyofparticularattention.Notallpricesorindicesneed

they critically affect consumer price inflation as measured by the Consumer Price
Index(CPI),nottomentionhousingandotherassetprices.8
The pervasive price-level significance of borrowing costs is precisely why central
banks in developed economies work directly to determine interest rates, or at any
rate to contain them within narrow bands.9 In effect, the OMOs of central banks
worldwide reflect broad recognition of the systemic significance of money rental
prices.10 There are other productive inputs, however, that are nearly or just as ubiq-
uitous as credit. Hence, there are other prices that are arguably nearly or just as sys-
temically significant as interest rates. Energy—and the fuels used to generate it—is
one obvious case in point.11 Labour is another.12 Certain foodstuffs, metals, and
other natural resources count too, though here the degree of systemic significance
will of course vary from resource to resource as a function of inter-substitutabilities
in production.

recognized as bearing systemic significance, and are accordingly acted upon with a
view to protecting certain system values—eg those of price stability and, also in
somecases,substantively‘reasonable’prices.

The popularity of a particular value as an investment vehicle is another factor that

This point is perhaps best illustrated by reference to homes and home prices in
theUS, whichprovedduring both the2007–09 crisis andits aftermathto bear both

capitalizationby2006.17Thisseemstohavestemmedpartlyfromspeculativemania,
partly from favourable regulatory treatment, and partly from outright fraud on the
part of loan-originators and -securitizers alike.18 Whatever the causes, however, the
sheer ubiquity of RMBS as favoured investment vehicles by the early 2000s meant
that home prices, to which RMBS values were of course closely correlated, became
systemically significant to the financial markets. The performance of RMBS prices,
hence the behaviour of RMBS market participants, rode crucially upon them from
2006onward.19
Housing prices bear not only indirect systemic significance to the financial mar-

Ubiquityofuseofthepriceorindexasabenchmark
The third and final characteristic we think lends prices or indices systemic signifi-
cance is their deliberate use as heuristics or ‘benchmarks’ in other pricing decisions.
It is common, for example, for financial actors to set interest rates in credit transac-
tions (including mortgage transactions), as well as the terms of derivative and other
financial contracts, by reference to the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)—

Turning from borrowing rates to other prices, it is also common, for example,
for petroleum prices to be priced relative to the so-called ‘Brent Crude’, ‘West
Texas Intermediate’, or ‘Dubai Crude’ petroleum price benchmarks.28 These for
their part are in most cases determined by small numbers of oil-producing firms
or states much as LIBOR is determined by a small number of large-banking in-
stitutions.29 They then determine in turn the prices asked for other fuel oils by
other actors.30 Other prices—eg those for index fund shares and financial deriva-
tives on the financial markets—are deliberately framed by reference to various
indices commonly watched by financial market participants. Familiar examples in
this case include the aforementioned Consumer Price Index, the Dow Jones
Industrial Averages, the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, and the Case–Shiller
Housing Price Index, to name but a few.31 Finally, yet other important bench-
mark-like prices are those of widely used currencies in relation to one another.
The forex markets too, in other words, ride crucially on relative prices that func-
tion as benchmarks.

SYSTEMIC VULNERABILITIES
Thecriteriaelaboratedabovefordeterminingwhetherparticularpricesorindicesare
systemically important amount to reasons for caring, as a polity, about these prices
or indices. They are characteristics that lend these prices or indices policy salience.
Whenitcomestodetermininghowtoreacttothatsalience,however,onemustfirst
understand the particular vulnerabilities to which the prices or indices in question,

Ausefulwaytoaddressthissecondquestionistoconcentrateonthemechanisms
through which systemically significant prices and indices are generated or deter-

these prices and indices can transmit to broader markets, originate. We will address
thesemechanismsandthevulnerabilitiestowhichtheygiverisebyreferencetopar-
ticular (i) information differentials and associated conflicts of interest, (ii) market
powerdifferentialsandassociatedmanipulationdangers,and(iii)recursivecollective

transaction is effectively betting against ‘the house’ on a prospect about which the
house has much more information. Moreover, the same would be true were ‘the

derivedfromthoseratesontheother.36
This asymmetry can yield any combination of three possible consequences. One
is that non-club-member institutions, aware of their disadvantages relative to club-
members, engage in fewer transactions of the contemplated type. Another is that
such institutions do enter into such transactions, but on terms that do not produce
fairequilibriumpricesofthekindthatarms-lengthtransactionsamongequalsareex-

cions rooted in that awareness appear to be confirmed by particular transactions in
which‘club’institutionsengage.38

Marketpowerdifferentialsandmanipulationdangers
The same harms just described can result not only from advantaged parties’ having
better knowledge of future changes in particular market values, but also from their
having greater capacity to determine such changes—the capacity conventionally re-
ferred to as ‘market power.’42 Consider the LIBOR hypothetical just contemplated,
for example. In this transaction the non-LIBOR-setting institution might effectively

withothers,actuallytoset.43
Thedegreeofsuchmarketpowerenjoyedby‘thehouse’inanygivencasewillof
course ride on the number of ‘club’ members and the cohesiveness of their collu-
sion.44 But the potential is nevertheless ever-present where systemically significant
pricesaresetbysmallcoalitionsofprivateactors—or,afortiori,byindividualparties
acting alone.45 Insofar as this danger is present, the market in question is subject to
the same forms of systemic vulnerability as those beset by the differential informa-
tionproblemdiscussedjustabove.
In short, then, once again we face the prospect of any combination of three
possible upshots. One is that non-club-member institutions, aware of their disad-
vantages relative to market-power-wielding club-members, engage in fewer transac-
tions of the contemplated type. Another is that such institutions do enter into
such transactions, but on terms that do not produce fair equilibrium prices of the
kind that arms-length transactions among equals are expected to produce. And a
third is that non-club-member institutions, aware of the ‘rigged game’ nature of
the markets, react in destabilizingly dramatic fashion when suspicions rooted in
that awareness appear to be confirmed by particular transactions in which the
‘club’ institutions engage.
In any of these three cases, again the relevant market is falling prey to a systemic
harm.Itisincomplete,unfairlyfunctioning,pronetovolatility,orsomecombination
of these.46 One consequence again is accordingly that the price system as operative

Recursivecollectiveactionproblems
Ironically,justastheconcentratedmarketpowerorinformationaladvantageenjoyed
bysomeprivatesettersofSIPIscanproducesystemicvulnerabilities,socanthelack
ofanysuchinstitutionorcoalitionofsuchinstitutionsinsomecases.Hereweallude
totherecursivecollectiveactionchallengestowhichmanydecentralizedmarkets,es-
peciallyfinancialandmoneymarkets,seemtobevulnerable.48
The hallmark of a collective action problem, of course, is its aggregating multiple
individually rational decisions into collectively irrational or calamitous outcomes.49
Recursive problems are those in which the problematic outcome in question
prompts a new round of decisions of the same type as produced the collectively
problematic outcome at the outset, thereby producing a yet worse outcome, with
more iterations following to the point of comprehensive catastrophe.50 Consumer
price hyperinflations, debt deflations, bums’ rushes and arms races are classic cases.
Soareassetpricebubbles,bankruns,andasset‘firesales.’51
Thecaseoftheassetfiresaleis particularlysalientwhereSIPI-mediatedsystemic
market fragilities are concerned. Consider the earlier-mentioned RMBS market, for
example.Asnotedbefore,RMBSpricesfallsquarelywithinthedefinitionof‘SIPI’as
wehaveelaboratedit.Yet,RMBSalsoweresubject—dramaticallysubject—toapar-
ticularlypoignantrecursivecollectiveactionproblem(‘ReCAP’)inmonthsculminat-
ingin2009.52
When it became clear in 2007–08 that some RMBS were backed in significant
measure by troubled ‘subprime’ mortgage loans and accordingly ‘toxic’, holders of
these securities were faced with a quandary: while there was reasonably reliable
knowledge in the markets that a specific percentage of all RMBS outstanding were
‘toxic’, nobody knew precisely which RMBS were the toxic ones.53 Under such cir-
cumstances it was rational for prudent investors to ‘bet cautiously’ and assume that
they held disproportionate shares of the toxic RMBS. Everyone thinking this way,
however, of course meant that investors in aggregate were undervaluing the market
portfolio;theywereeffectivelyacting‘asif’theaggregateportionoftoxicRMBSwas
much larger than they all knew it to be.54 When they acted accordingly and sold si-
multaneously, they of course drove down the prices of RMBS further, which of
coursetriggeredmoreroundsofmassselling,furtherpricedrops,andsoon—aclas-

just recounted was no ordinary fire sale. It was a systemically catastrophic fire sale. It
massivelydestroyedvalueincountlessportfolios,includingretirement portfolios,on
which millions were reliant.56 It also drove housing prices—which we noted above
alsotobesystemicallysignificant—yetlowerbyraisingthecostofmortgageandrefi-
nance credit and thereby constricting housing demand and raising foreclosure
rates.57 And finally, of course, it caused massive losses among those who had effec-
tively ‘bet’ on RMBS performance, housing prices, or both via CDOs, CDS, and
otherderivativeinstruments.58
None of this would have had to happen, at least not with the magnitude that it
did, had some collectiveagent beenable to act to ensure that the aggregate value of
RMBS outstanding more closely reflected the ‘toxicity’ of the market portfolio of
RMBS.59 This is in part what the Treasury’s Troubled Asset Relief Programme
(TARP)andtheFed’sMaidenLaneFundsweremeanttoassistwith,thoughclarity
aboutthemissionandhenceeffectivenessintheexecutionatfirstleftmuchtobede-
sired.60 Happily, Maiden Lane in particular and, later, QE3 have done much better
thanTARPatfirstdid,inthecomparativetranquilityofthepost-crisisyears.
In any event, the message for present purposes is clear enough: the absence of
concentrated informational advantage or marketpower can be as problematic as the
presence of either where the transmission of systemic vulnerability to financial and
broadermarkets via SIPIs is concerned. What, then,to do? Theanswer, wethink, is
to opt in favour of concentrated informational advantage and market power, but to
ensurethattheadvantageandpowerinquestionareheldorcontrolledbypublic,as
distinguished from private, actors. This of course takes us to policy responses to
SIPI-mediatedsystemicvulnerability.
ENHANCED REGULATION
Asnotedearlier,theDodd–FrankregimeputinplaceintheUSfollowingthe2007–
09 troubles treats so-called SIFIs and systemically important market utilities as ‘spe-
cial’ in viewof their systemic importance,and accordingly subjects them to enhance
prudential regulatory standards. We believe that an analogous strategy would make
foranintuitivelytractable,politicallyfeasible,andregulatorilypracticablefirststepin
addressingthevulnerabilitiestowhichSIPIsgiverise.
Like the Dodd–Frank regime, then, we would recommend first vesting authority
inaregulatorybodyorsmallgroupofsuchbodiestodesignateparticularpricesand

enhanced prudential regulatory standards to which the derivation and maintenance

SIPIdesignation
The first task in developing a regime able to handle SIPI-associated market vulner-
abilities is to determine who decides whether a particular price or index warrants
SIPIstatus,andpursuanttowhatcriteria.Wehaveineffectalreadyaddressedthelat-
ter, ‘what’ question in the section ‘Designation Criteria’, so will concentrate here on
the‘who’question.
Beginningwiththedomesticcase,wherethepriceorindexinquestionissubjectto
primaryUSjurisdiction,theFSOCwouldseemthenaturalbodytodischargethistask.
It is, after all, the body in which Dodd–Frank vests SIFI-designation authority, pre-
ciselybecauseitisthebodythathasresponsibilityforoverseeingtheUSfinancialsys-
tem as a whole—ie as a comprehensive and integrated system.61 As for the standards
to be employed by the FSOC in making these determinations, again, we think those
elaborated above in the section ‘Designation Criteria’ are well suited to the task. This
isbothforthereasonsstatedthereandbecause,asnotedbefore,thesestandardsreso-
natecloselywiththoselaidoutinTitleIofDodd–Frankitselfinaffordingguidanceto
theFSOConthesubject.
Where prospective SIPIs are not subject to primary US jurisdiction, we recom-
mend that counterparts to FSOC make counterpart designation decisions, again on
thebasisofcriteriareminiscentofthoseelaboratedaboveinthesection‘Designation
Criteria’.For aprice or index overwhichthe UKhas primaryjurisdiction,for exam-
ple,probablytheFCA,actinginconsultationwiththeBankofEngland(BoE)would
be the appropriate designator. In the EU, the appropriate body is the European
Commission, responsible for the EU’s new benchmark-regulatory reform developed
inresponseto2012’sLIBOR-relatedscandal.62Forapriceorindexoverwhichmul-
tiplenations’authoritieshavejurisdiction,ontheotherhand,itwouldseemtomake
sensefortheFSBtodothedesignating;itis,afterall,theclosestglobalanalogthere
istotheUSFSOC.63
In these transnational cases the process of SIPI designation should resemble the
process of transnational capital-regulatory convergence as pursued via the Basel
Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS): the world’s primary systemic financial
regulators would first agree on particular SIPI designations, then implement these
decisions through rulemakings or counterpart regulatory actions back home.64 We
are uncertain whether there are too many procedural or substantive disagreements
across jurisdictions for such a process to be practicable; but we doubt it, and in any
event there is no way to find out with reasonable certainty whether such challenges
confrontusuntilwecommencewiththeeffort.
Intheworstcasescenarioofnon-agreement,moreover,thereseemsnoreasonto
suppose that any particular jurisdiction—certainly the US—could not at least ad-
dress domestically those risks that any prospective SIPI might raise in its own

SubstantiveSIPI-regulatorystandards
The second task in developing a regime able to handle SIPI-associated market vul-
nerabilitiesistodevelopsubstantiveregulatorystandardstowhichSIPIs,oncedesig-
nated as such, will be held subject. This task, like the designation task, likewise
implicates both ‘who’ and ‘what’ questions, neither of which we have yet addressed.
We,accordingly,addressbothhereinthatorder.
Who
Wherethe ‘who’-related questionis concerned, wemust once againconfrontvaria-
tion rooted in jurisdictional differences with respect to various prospective SIPIs. If
thepriceorindexinquestionissubjecttoprimaryUSjurisdiction,theFed,actingin
collaboration with appropriate ‘functional’ regulators in some cases, would seem the
natural ‘who’ to discharge the substantive regulatory task. The Fed is, after all, the
body in which Title I of Dodd–Frank vests SIFI-regulatory authority, even while di-
rectingtheFedtoactinconsultationwithfunctionalregulatorswherenon-banksre-
ceive SIFI designations.65 There seems no reason not to follow the same pattern
withrespecttoSIPIregulation.
Were theCase–ShillerHousingPrice Indexto bedesignated aSIPI, forexample,
itwouldseemtomakesensetochargetheFed,theFederalHousingAgency(FHA),
and the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) with the task of developing en-
hancedregulatorystandardstowhichthisindex’sconstructionandusewouldbesub-

SIPI,ontheotherhand,orwerethepriceofawidelytradedpetroleumpricederiva-
tive to be likewise designated, it would seem sensible to charge the Fed, the CFTC,
andtheFERCwiththetask.
Where prospective SIPIs are not subject to primary US jurisdiction, counterparts
to the Fed and the US functional regulators should probably develop the enhanced
regulatory standards. For a price or index over which the UK has primary jurisdic-
tion,forexample,presumablytheBoEandFCAwouldbetheappropriatestandards
developers. For a price or index over which multiple nations’ authorities have juris-
diction,ontheotherhand,itwouldseemtomakesensefortheBCBS(includingas
it does the world’s central bank chairs and finance ministers) and the appropriate
transnational functional regulatory forum (eg the International Organization of
Securities Commissions (IOSCO)) to do the standard developing. It is worth once

Generally,incasesrequiringtransnationalcooperation,againwethinktheprocess
wouldbeststartbyemulatingthatpursuanttowhichtheBCBSitselffacilitatestrans-
national capital-regulatory convergence. National regulators would first seek agree-
ment upon substantive regulatory standards, then implement those standards back
homethroughrulemakingsorcounterpartregulatoryactions.
What
TurningfromwhowilldevelopenhancedSIPI-regulatorystandardstowhatthecon-
tentofsuchstandardsshouldbe,asnotedabovewebelievethatoneormoreoffive
regulatorystrategies will prove helpfulfor mostpurposes. Weelaborate these strate-
gies, also as noted above, by reference to the particular vulnerabilities to which the
processesofparticularSIPIs’generationordeterminationaresubject.
Enhanced oversight. The first regulatory option, which we think well advised for all
SIPIs,isenhancedoversight.Theideahereisfortheappropriateregulatororregula-
tors,asdeterminedaccordingtocriteriaelaboratedimmediatelyaboveinthesubsec-
tion ‘Ubiquity of the Underlying Value as a Productive Input’, simply to supervise
the construction and/or administration of the SIPI in question. They would attend
inparticularbothtohowtheSIPIisbeinggeneratedordetermined,andtohowitis
being used. In so doing, they would be on the lookout for evidence either that pri-
vate parties who jointly or severally generate or determine the SIPI in question are
systematically using informational advantages or market power in transactions with
others, or that rapid movements in the SIPI in question are attributable to recursive
collectiveactionchallenges—iearebubble-orbust-related.Theregulatorsmustalso,
of course, have all information-gathering authority, including subpoena power that
might be necessary in adequately discharging the enhanced oversight function. The
UK has responded to the LIBOR scandals of 2012 with a strategy of this general
kind.67
Licensure/pre-approval. The second regulatory option, responsive to informational
advantage, conflicted interest, and associated manipulation or collusion opportuni-
ties, is to require licensure or pre-approval of private institutions that establish or
maintain widely used benchmarks which receive SIPI designation.68 The basic idea
here is to ensure that those who develop, provide, or maintain benchmark indices
not employ their roles vis-(cid:2)a-vis these indices to extract rents from others who lack
suchroles.69
Requiring licensure can be helpful in realizing this desideratum in several
ways. First, it puts parties on notice that the privileged role that they play with re-
spect to their indices both carries special responsibilities and is contingent on their
fulfilling these responsibilities. The situation here is reminiscent of that faced by
67 Main(n32).

track record of regulatory compliance in one or more markets, for example, can be
disqualified in advance, under a licensing regime, from taking part in the determina-
tionofpricesorindicesthataredesignatedasSIPIs.
Finally and relatedly, a licensing regime offers the opportunity of regularly re-ex-
amining those who determine designated SIPIs, with a view to their ongoing habits
of compliance—at least if the license has to be regularly renewed. A useful model
heremightbetheB-Dregistrationregime,pursuanttowhichB-Dsmusttakeregular

Utility-style regulation.The third regulatory option, againresponsive to informational
advantage, conflicted interest, and associated manipulation or collusion opportuni-
ties,aswellastomarketpower,istodeveloparegimeofenhancedutility-styleregu-
lation—including in some cases participation by regulators in the very ‘clubs’ or
coalitions that aggregate and publish ‘benchmark’ prices or indices. Here the idea is
torecognizeforthrightlythatthedevelopmentandmaintenanceofsomeSIPIsmight
be in the nature of a ‘natural monopoly’ function, at least if (i) scale economies or
networkeffects renderconcentrationin some industriesstructurallylikely,while (ii)
consequently large firms in those industries then come naturally to wield dispropor-
tionate influence on prices simply by acting, as ‘big’ actors, in markets that generate
thoseprices.70
There is reason to think, for example, that certain kinds of insurance might give
rise to natural monopolies or, at any rate, oligopolies within associated insurance
markets.71 If that is so, and were insurance companies in such markets to develop
andmaintainsomepriceindexorbenchmarkthatcametofunctionasaSIPI,thenit

all such requests made by all designated utilities firms.75 We suggest that options
analogous to these would likewise be possible where SIPI determination is
concerned.
One model would be for a ‘SIPI Rates Board’ to be authorized to oversee all
SIPIs determined by naturally monopolistic or oligopolistic firms and require, any
time that a movement in a SIPI did not appear readily explicable by reference to

There are, again, many possibilities here—too many to vet comprehensively in
thisarticle.Wethinktheprocessofthinking-upandthinking-throughsuchpossibili-

Enhanced antitrust and anti-fraud regulation. The fourth option we envisage, now re-
sponsivemoreparticularlytomarketpowerandpotentialcollusion,isenhancedanti-
trust and anti-fraud regulation. The idea in this case is simple and familiar. If a
particularpriceorindexthathasbeendesignatedaSIPIisemployedormanipulated
inarent-seekingmannerbyanyinstitutionorinstitutionswithmarketpowerinrela-
tion to that SIPI, this would presumptively constitute a straightforward violation of
the norms that our antitrust and anti-fraud regimes are meant to vindicate. It would
also seem to constitute a straightforward violation of the anti-fraud norms that find
expression in various parts of the bank-, securities-, and other finance-regulatory
laws. In all such cases, moreover, the stakes and likely consequences of such viola-
tionsareparticularlydramatic,invirtueoftheveryfeaturesthatrenderthepricesor

incrementalism: it is a straightforward ‘tweaking’ of regimes that have long been in
place.
A related strategy, operating from the front-end, would be to mandate the use of
larger sample sets in constructing an index or benchmark.78 In effect, this would
amounttobroadeningthesizeoftheanticompetitive‘club’whoseoligopolisticmar-
ket power occasions the dangers we face in the first place. This strategy would also,
in virtue of its ex ante character, be cross-cutting inasmuch as it could be made part
of a licensure or utility-style regime, as discussed just above, as readily as part of an
antitrust-styleregime.
Extended OMOs. The fifth and final regulatory option we think worth considering is
this one responsive to the recursive collective action problems that beset some
decentralized markets in which SIPIs are operative, is price maintenance—typically
within some band—through OMOs. The idea here is to take seriously one of the
many lessons thrown up by the experience of 2007–09. This is the lesson that in
some cases, market decentralization itself can work systematically disastrous effects
via the medium of some systemically significant price like that of RMBS. As noted
above, RMBS were systematically undervalued by markets during the panic, such
that only a ‘large’ actor capable of in effect ‘buying the market’ or a significant por-
tionthereofwouldhavebeenabletokeeppricesinlinewithlesspanic-wrought,lon-
ger term mean values. Any private actor that large, however, would have possessed
‘marketpower’withwhichfewwouldbecomfortable,atleastwerethatprivateactor
tobepursuingaprivateagenda.79
The obvious solution in such case is to empower a large public actor pursuing a
public agenda. This is effectively the form of response to which the US groped via
theTARPandMaidenLaneprogrammesmentionedabove,aswellasviaQE3asan-
nounced by the Fed in the autumn of 2012.80 It is also, more permanently, the way
in which the US handles systemically important interest rates in Fed OMOs, and in
some circumstances the way in which it handles price spikes in petroleum markets
viatheSPR.81

SIPIs,then,isOMOsinmarkets additionalto moneyrental,RMBS,andpetroleum.

VariouscandidateSIPIsherecometomind.TheS&P500orWilshire5000mar-
ket indices constitute one class of candidates, in view of their relation to the perfor-
manceofthesecuritiesmarkets(andconsequent‘wealtheffects’economy-wide)asa
whole. Certain sensitive commodity prices—those for widely used fuels, foodstuffs,
and some other raw materials, for example—constitute another class of candidates.
Finally, wage or salary indices constitute yet another class of candidates. In all of
these cases, there is at least some reason—most such reasons sounding in (i) the
samefactorsasrendertheindiceshereSIPIsinthefirstplace,and(ii)theassociated

CONCLUSION
We have had to cover a fair bit of territory in this article, hence have done so in a
necessarily preliminary way in view of space constraints. We think the inquiry well-
defined and contained, however, and well worth more fully developed pursuit. The
reasons for deemingsome financial institutions and marketutilities ‘systemically im-
portant’, we think, are both compelling and now widely recognized. The Dodd–
Frank Act in the US accordingly did well to recognize this new category of institu-
tion and market utility in the wake of the crisis of 2007–09, and also did reasonably

ciallytoregulate,suchinstitutionsandutilitiesincurrentmarkets.
Thesameconsiderationsaswarrantidentificationandenhancedregulationofso-
called‘SIFIs’, however,seem tousalso towarrant identificationandenhancedregu-
lation of what we here have dubbed ‘SIPIs’. Such prices and indices are at least as
pervasively influential on financial market performance and macroeconomic conse-
quence as are SIFIs, and can be readily identified by reference to similar criteria.
They also lend themselves, we have argued, to similar—or at any rate already
familiar—formsof enhancedregulation,as recentEUandother jurisdictions’efforts
