Constitutions, written or unwritten, are sets of rules, practices, and customs that

form,theytypicallyaspiretoconstraingovernmentpower,assureadherencetothe
rule of law, and protect individual rights (Rosenfeld 1994: 3). As such, they Wt
Douglass North’s conception of an institution as a socially imposed constraint or
setofconstraintsuponhumanbehavior(North1990:3).Ofcourse,intheirvariety
and signiWcance, they pose questions of obvious interest to political scientists,
sociologists,andlegalscholars.Someofthesequestionsarecomparativeinnature:

Because constitutions, written or unwritten, can be given operational meaning
only through the workings of other political institutions, any analysis of how
constitutionsshapeandfacilitatehumaninteractionmustnecessarilybecomplex.
In the United States, it is impossible to speak sensibly of ‘‘what the ConstitutionRhodesetal.:TheOxfordhandbookofPoliticalInstitutions 11-Rhodes-chap11 PageProof page 192 15.4.2006 3:05pm

does’’ without reference to its invocation and use by the three branches of federal
and state governments, as well as by local political entities and even by the
organizationsofcivilsociety.Thisfact,however,entailsanadditionalcomplexity.
The primary human activity through which constitutions are translated into
operational authorizations or constraints is interpretation. Yet, the available
researchonconstitutionalinterpretation—mostofwhichfocusesontheoperation
ofconstitutionalinterpretationintheUnitedStatesSupremeCourt—tendstofall
intotwoverydisparate perspectivesonthe natureof theinterpretive enterprise.
The two distinct views may helpfully be referred to ‘‘internal’’ and ‘‘external’’
(Feldman 2005: 89–90.) According to the ‘‘internal view,’’ what legal materials
say—that is, the history and wording of constitutions, statutes, prior judicial
opinions, and so on—signiWcantly determines how they are interpreted. Under
this view, when lawyers and judges give operational meaning to constitutions,
statutes, and legal precedents, they are meaningfully limited by what can logically
be deduced from the rules and principles that emanate from such legal materials
(Feldman 2005). Although there is probably no one who thinks that those limits
oVeracompleteexplanationforallofthebehaviorofalllegalactors,itisapremise
of most modern legal scholarship that the internal view is, to some signiWcant
degree,well-founded.
In contrast, according to the external view, what governs the behavior of legal
actorsarestimuliexternaltothelegalmaterialsthemselves(Feldman2005).Chief
amongthemaretheactors’politicalorientations,namely,preferencesorideologies
that,dependingonthemodel,mayfollowfromanynumberofcauses—economic
orpoliticalself-interestbeingthemostobvious(SegalandSpaeth1993:64–9).This
is undoubtedly the predominant view among political scientists (Feldman 2005:
90). One meta-analysis of over eighty papers has found a robust association
betweenjudicialdecisionsandjudicialpoliticalattitudesacrosslegalissues,courts
systems, and statistical method of analysis (Pinello 1999). Thus, in the external
view,whatajudgedecidesmayberationalizedinthelanguageoflaw,butitisnot
thelaw thatproducesoutcomes,but other sources ofjudicialattitude.
An accurate picture almost certainly requires a perspective that draws on both
theseviews.AsigniWcantongoingprojectamonglegalresearchersistheattemptto

their personal political and moral values in an appropriately channeled and
therefore legitimate manner in constitutional interpretation (e.g. Feldman
2005; Dworkin 1996). Among political scientists, perhaps the most exciting new
development is the ‘‘new institutionalism,’’ an eVort to showhow the attitudes of
legal actors, especially judges, are shaped not only by individual preference, but
alsobytheinstitutionsthroughwhichtheseactorsoperateandtherelationshipof
those institutions to others. Leading writers in this vein include Cornell Clayton,
Howard Gillman, Mark Graber, Rogers Smith and Keith Whittington (Gillman

These complementary lines of analysis reXect an admirable eVort to get beyond
reductionist models of law that either treat legal interpretation as implausibly
objective and mechanical or reduce law to something merely obfuscatory or
‘‘epiphenomenal’’(Feldman2005:92).
1 The Status and Function of
Constitutions
.........................................................................................................................................................................................
IntheAmericanpubliclawsystem,aconstitutionisinvariablyfundamentalinthe
sensethatagovernmentactundertakenpursuanttoastateorfederalconstitution
isexpectedtoconformtoitsrequirementsandlimitations.Sincetherevolutionary
period, this essential characteristic of American constitutions, both state and
federal, has been regarded as Xowing inexorably from their written character.1
Other systems, most notably that of Great Britain, may feature a constitutional
doctrine ofparliamentarysupremacy,inwhichtheconstitution imposesnomore
than theoretical limits on legislative acts (DeSmith and Brazier 1989: 15). Even in
such systems, however, courts may presume an ordinary parliamentary intention
nottodepartfromtheconstitution,writtenorunwritten,andmaylimitthereach
of legislative measures through judicial interpretation designed to reconcile par-
liamentary acts with judicially inferred constitutional constraints (Krotoszynski
1994:7–11).
In the American and other systems where a constitution is understood to
constrain legislative action, constitutions will diVer with regard to how easy they
aretochangeandwithrespecttotheauthoritiesempoweredtointerpretwhether
government conformity to the constitution has been achieved. For example, state
constitutions in the United States are frequently easy to amend by popular refer-
endum(MarksandCooper2003:300–14).Internationally,partofwhatmakesthe

seem yet more notable as compared to other legal systems because, at the federal
level, American judges involved are presidential appointees with lifetime tenure
and no directelectoral accountability.
There are at least four ways in which constitutions may be thought to shape
or facilitate the actions of government institutions or of citizens themselves—

ing the exercise of government power, limiting the exercise of government power,
and creating aYrmativeobligations ofgovernment tothecitizenry.
2 Implementing Key Founding Bargains
.........................................................................................................................................................................................
Americans tend to pay greatest attention to those constitutional provisions that
articulate deeply-held value commitments, such a free speech or due process, or
implementwhatwetaketobeenduring principlesofinstitutionaldesign,suchas
the separation of powers. Constitutions, however, typically include at least some
features that do not fall into either category. That is because, when a written
constitution is drafted concurrently with the formation of a new regime or
nation-state,itislikelythatthedocumentwillbeformulated,inpart,toentrench
particular political bargains, often messy ones, that were essential to regime
formation. In the case of the United States, the subjects of the key bargains are
wellknown.Onewasthefearofsmallerstates,especiallystateswithoutgoodports,
that their interests would be overlooked or subordinated in a union with their
more powerful neighbors. Thesecond wasslavery.
Because of the original small-state concerns, the United States Constitution
continues to entrench most forcefully its most deeply anti-democratic provision,
namely,thedesignofafederalupperlegislativeHousewithtwomembersforevery
state,regardlessofsize.AlthoughtheUnitedStatesConstitutionisalwaysdiYcult
toamend,typicallyrequiringtwo-thirdsofeachHouseofCongresstoproposean
amendmentandratiWcationbythree-fourthsofthestates,thesmallstates’holdon
the Senate is protected by the additional provision in Article V that ‘‘no state,
without its consent, shall be deprived of its equal suVrage in the Senate.’’ As a
consequence, the United States seems to be stuck permanently with a Senate in
which a majority of Senators routinely represent a minority of US voters (Shane
2003:539).Furthermore,underArticleI,section10,statesarenotallowed,without
consent of Congress, to ‘‘lay any imposts or duties on imports or exports,’’ or to
‘‘enter into any agreement of compact with another state,’’ thus providing small
statesyetfurther protection frompredation by theirlarger neighbors.
Yet more ignominious bargains were struck, however, because of slavery.
Although the words ‘‘slave’’ and ‘‘slavery’’ never appear in the document—a
gesture to the free states’ sensibilities—the Constitution prohibited Congress
from stopping or even taxing the international slave trade prior to 1808 (Art. I, §
9). It credited the slave states, for purposes of legislative apportionment, with aRhodesetal.:TheOxfordhandbookofPoliticalInstitutions 11-Rhodes-chap11 PageProof page 195 15.4.2006 3:05pm

population that included three-Wfths of their slaves (Art. I, § 2). The Article on
constitutional amendment protected the twenty-year slave trade ‘‘window’’ by
prohibiting any amendments that would shorten it (Art. V). The Constitution
still includes text providing that no state may enact laws purporting to discharge
from‘‘serviceorlabor’’anypersonwhoescapestothatstatefromanotherinwhich
theyarelawfully‘‘heldtoserviceorlabor’’(Art.IV,§2).Instead,anysuchescapee
‘‘shallbedelivereduponclaimofthepartytowhomsuchserviceorlabormaybe
due’’ (Art. IV, § 2). Over the long term, these attempts to mediate the interests of
free and slave states through law proved unavailing without war, and yet, it is
certainlytruethat,withouttheinitialbargains,nonationalunionspanningthefull
east coastof thepresent-day United States would have been possible.
IdiosyncraticconstitutionalarrangementsreXectingmerelythepoliticalexigen-
cies of a founding era can bedevil the enterprise of constitutional interpretation.
Contemporary constitutional scholars along with numerous civil society groups
often argue, for example, that the United States Constitution ought to be inter-
pretedinlightofwhatistakentobeafundamentalcommitmentinthatdocument
to the value of democracy (e.g., Ely 1980.) But, given the entrenched Senate
structure, the exclusion of DC residents from voting representation in Congress
and the arcane machineryof the presidential election process—eachofwhich is a
constitutional response to some eighteenth-century political anxiety that may no
longer be salient—it may seem diYcult to give the Constitution any coherent
democraticreading.Moreover,politicalintereststhatstilldrawstrengthfromthese
provisions arelikely toprevent theirchange.
3 Structuring the Exercise of Power
.........................................................................................................................................................................................
At a more general level, it is, of course, the function of the United States Consti-
tution, and presumably of all constitutions, to create the basic skeleton of oYces
andoYcialprocessesthroughwhichgovernmentpowershallbeexercised,aswell
as the processes through which oYceholders shall be selected. In structuring the
allocation of government authority, the United States Constitution is generally
described as embodying two fundamental government design principles, around
which its more particularized provisions are oriented: federalism and the separ-
ation of powers. Federalism describes the allocation of power to both federal
and state authorities, motivated by two general goals: a federal governmental
competence adequate to address national challenges and protection for the
governmental prerogatives of the states, which are regarded as closer to andRhodesetal.:TheOxfordhandbookofPoliticalInstitutions 11-Rhodes-chap11 PageProof page 196 15.4.2006 3:05pm

vestedindiVerentinstitutions,andthegreatereYciencyandeVectivenessthought
to follow from focusing each branch’s attention on tasks especially suited to its
composition and processes(Fisher 1971).
With regard to a number of these key details of organization and process, the
Constitution is suYciently explicit so that few occasions have arisen calling for
furtherinterpretation.Yet,onahostofcriticalissues,theprovisionsthroughwhich
thefoundersarticulatedtheirdesignsforfederalismandseparationofpowershave
proved highly ambiguous. These ambiguities have helped to sustain over
two centuries of controversy largely because the purposes underlying the design
principles arethemselves notably intension.
With regard to federalism, for example, the overriding question has been
whether to regard the achievement of national competence or the insulation of
state sovereignty as the primary value.2 Debates have been especially heated with
regard to the scope of the clause that authorizes Congress to regulate ‘‘commerce
with foreign nations, and among the several states’’ (Art. I, § 8). Many Supreme
Court Justices, especially since the New Deal, have regarded the so-called Com-
merce Clause as embodying the framers’ desire that Congress have suYcient
authority to deal with virtually all social and economic problems of national
scope. Such Justices would extend Congress’s commerce power to include the
direct regulation of interstate commercial activity for virtually any purpose, as
wellastheregulationofvirtuallyanyactivity—localor not,commercialornot—
that,takenintheaggregate,couldhaveasigniWcanteVectoninterstatecommerce.3
Yet otherJustices areconcerned that,read inthisway,Congress’s authorityunder
the Commerce Clause could be expanded to obliterate what they regard as a
fundamental constitutional commitment to primary state control over issues of
health, safety, and public welfare and morals. For such Justices, Congress may
regulate local or non-commercial activities that substantially aVect interstate

that their regulation would still leave intact the states’ traditional areas of sover-
eignty.4
Thesearchfor balancebetweentheseviewsmay proveelusive,evenforasingle
Court. Thus, for example, in 1995, the Supreme Court held, in a 5–4 vote, that
Congress overreached its authority in purporting to criminalize the knowing
possession of a Wrearm in a so-called local ‘‘school zone.’’5 Despite the obvious
linkagebetweenthreatsofgunviolenceandthequalityofeducation,andbetween
thequalityofeducationandtherobustnessoftheinterstateeconomy,themajority
found such reasoning too attenuated to support the regulation of behavior that
hadnothingbyitselftodowithcommerceoreconomicactivity.6Bycontrast,just

groundthatsuchaprohibitionwasintegraltoacomprehensiveeVorttoeliminate
the national market in marijuana.7 A compelling jurisprudential distinction
betweenthe casesis not easy tospot.
A similar sort of debate has bedeviled the development of constitutional juris-
prudence regarding the separation of powers. For proponents of what might be
called a ‘‘pluralist’’ view of this aspect of constitutional design—prominent
examplesincludeCynthiaFarina,MartinFlaherty,AbnerGreene,ThomasSargen-

Calabresi, Elena Kagan, Lawrence Lessig,GeoVrey Miller,SaikrishnaPrakash, and
CassSunstein,generallyadvanceanambitiousvisionofexecutivepowerunderthe
Constitution, and thus the modern-day version of this stance can accurately
be called ‘‘presidentialist’’ (Calabresi and Prakash 1994; Kagan 2001; Lessig and

Originally,threemodesofselectionwereemployedfortheelectedbranches:direct

cussed compromise that resulted after the drafters rejected the two options they
quite consciously did not want: direct popular election or selection by Congress
(Rakove 2004). It was anxieties about mass democracy and about subordinating
federal executive authority to federal legislative power that motivated the
adoptionofAmerica’sidiosyncraticsystem.ForalltheinXuencetheUnitedStates
Constitution has had on subsequent eVorts, no other country has adopted the
electoralcollege.
4 Limiting the Exercise of
Government Power
.........................................................................................................................................................................................
Beyond its aYrmative allocations of government power and speciWcations of
oYces and processes by which that power shall be exercised, the Constitution
also limits the exercise of government power in the name of individual rights.
Althoughtheoriginal1787documentincludedanumberofsigniWcantprovisions
of this kind—disallowing states from discriminating against residents of other
states (Art. IV, § 2), prohibiting the imposition of any ‘‘religious test’’ as a
qualiWcation for federal oYce (Art. VI), proscribing bills of attainder and ex post
facto laws (Art. I, § 9), and guaranteeing the right of habeas corpus except in
certain cases of ‘‘rebellion or invasion’’ (Art. I, §9)—its drafters thought theRhodesetal.:TheOxfordhandbookofPoliticalInstitutions 11-Rhodes-chap11 PageProof page 199 15.4.2006 3:05pm
analyzing constitutions 199
Constitution’s primary protections for individual liberty lay in the checking and
balancingstructureofthenationalgovernment(Brown1991)andinthelimitation
of the new national government to a set of enumerated powers. Today, the best
known and most enduringly controversial of the limitations on government
authority are contained in the Bill of Rights and in the post-Civil War Amend-
ments, most notably,the Fourteenth.
For at least two reasons, it can hardly be surprising that the content of such
rights remains the subject of heated debate. First, the key beneWciaries of these
provisionsmayincludethosewhosesocialstatusorpoliticalcloutmakesitdiYcult
forthemtoprotecttheirintereststhroughelectorallyaccountableinstitutions.The
claimssuchcitizensmakearelikelytobeunpopular.Second,therightsarticulated
are virtually always framed in broad terms that clearly signal a potential scope of
applicability way beyond any speciWc understanding of their likely application at
the time they were drafted. It has been argued—for example, by former judge
RobertBork(1989)andbycurrentUnitedStatesSupremeCourtAssociateJustice
AntoninScalia(1997:47)—thatcourtsshouldnotlimitmajoritariangovernancein
the name of rights that were not clearly anticipated when the relevant constitu-

thatAmericansremainintentonentrenchingarobustunderstandingofindividual
rights in their constitution—the Constitution would have to be continually
amendedaschangesineconomic,socialandpoliticalcircumstancesposeunantici-
pated issues. For individual rights, the exercise of which is likely to challenge
majority sentiment, thisseemshighly problematic.
A profound, but indirect consequence of the Constitution’s role in protecting
individual rights is that the American Constitution, virtually from the founding,
hasprovidedafocusandashapetoahostofmovementsforsocialchange.These
includemovementstoamendtheConstitution,forexample,toguaranteewomen’s
suVrageor togivestatehoodtoWashington,DC,aswellasmovementsthatinsist
that the Constitution, properly interpreted, would advance a social cause, such as
abolitionism in the nineteenth Century or same-sex marriage now.8 At the
moment, the proposal of new constitutional amendments seems a preferred
political organizing tactic of conservatives—amendments to prohibit same-sex
marriage, forbid abortion, or to authorize the criminalization of Xag desecration
are all of this type. There is emerging, however, a debate on the political left
whether equivalent eVorts ought not be mustered on behalf of stronger voting
rights, guarantees of equal educational resources, and protections of such ‘‘safety
net’’featuresaspublicly Wnanced health careor housing(Jackson 2001).

to channel political protest into largely peaceful forms and to signiWcantly legit-
imate an existing regime, even as it holds out the promise of revolutionary
challenge to the status quo (Powell 1986). The implicit premises of movements
either to change a constitutional text or ‘‘improve’’ its interpretation are that
constitutional entrenchment is an appropriate mechanism for protecting social
valuesandthatexisting processesforconstitutionalchangeareworthyofpursuit.
In the American system, such movements also imply the legitimating impact of
judicial pronouncements concerning the constitutionality of government acts
(Black 1969). Advocates of constitutional change tacitly recognize that, in the
eyes of many Americans, court judgments upholding laws against constitutional
challenge enhance their legitimacy. Thus, judicial interpretation is an essential
targetofmovements tochangewhat the Constitutionsays.
Although Americans are presumably inclined to believe that their freedom is
enhanced by the constitutional entrenchment of individual liberties, the precise
contribution of any constitution to the degree or quality of freedom that any
society enjoys is not easy to assess. In the decades after the Civil War, the
Fourteenth Amendment’s guarantee of ‘‘equal protection of the laws’’ accom-
plished little for the African-Americans who were the Amendment’s primary
intendedbeneWciaries(Bell1980:30–8).Constitutionalskepticscancitethefailure
of challenges to the suppression of dissident speech and political activity around
World War Ior to the internment of Japanese-Americans during World War IIas
evidence of the Constitution’s limited reliability. In an inXuential critique of the

debate, frequently valuing the ‘‘autonomy’’ of wealthy or corporate interests over
the access of individual citizens to meaningful, well-informed, politically robust
discourse (Fiss 1986). Yet, it seems highly improbable that America’s textual
commitment to fundamental liberties is irrelevant to its success in maintaining a
comparativelyopensociety.
5 Creating Affirmative Government
Obligations

A fourth functionof constitutions is to establishaYrmative public welfare rights,
and the United States Constitution is now among the minority that fails to

analyzing constitutions 201
in American courts. Although it remains conventional wisdom that the United
States Constitution does not create welfare rights that are enforceable in federal
courts,manystatecourtshaveinterpretedstateconstitutionalprovisionsregarding
public education as mandating not only a minimally adequate level of education,
but also equity among school districts in the funding of public schools (Dayton
and Dupree2004).
There is some historical irony here. Those constitutions around the globe that
protect social and economic rights may reXect the inXuence of the Weimar
Constitution of 1919 or of socialist legal thought. It is also true, however, that
manyofthesocialrightsprovisionsofpost-WorldWarIIconstitutionsdrawtheir
inspirationfromtherightsdiscourseoftheAmericanNewDeal,includingFrank-
linRoosevelt’scallfor‘‘thefourfreedoms’’and‘‘asecondBillofRights’’(Sunstein
2004). More recently, American constitutional theorists, most notably, Frank
Michelman (1969) and William Forbath (1999 and 2001), have tried to argue that
the United States Constitution, properly interpreted, actually does imply some
minimal set of welfare rights as a precondition to meaningful citizenship. But,
althoughtheWarrenCourtinthe1960sseemedtobeedgingtowardsthatview,the
Burger and RehnquistCourtshavebeen notably unsympathetic.
Whereconstitutionsdonotarticulatesocialrightsexpressly,itislikelytobenot
just—or even primarily—the absence of authorizing text, but rather anxieties
about judicial enforcement of such rights that impedes their recognition.
As recounted by Forbath (2004: 622–7), judges may regard social rights as too
indeterminate to permit justiciability. They may entertain a related fear that the
articulation and prospective enforcement of social welfare rights would tempt
judges excessively to overstep the appropriate judicial role and to implement
personalpolicypreferencesintheguiseoflaw.Judgesmayregardcourtsaslacking
the competence to engage in the sensitive allocational trade-oVs that social rights
remedies could entail. They may regard judicial decision making about welfare
rights,especiallybecauseofthepotentialbudgetaryimpacts,asposingtoogreata
set of constraints on the decisional authority of the elected branches of govern-
ment. Relatedly, should unelected judges take too conspicuous a role in the
allocation of social resources, the resulting incursion into the citizenry’s role in
self-governance may be seen by voters as too great a threat to overall democratic
accountability.
Notwithstandingthislist ofobjections,itis stillworthnotingthat anumberof
constitutional courts around the globe have been enforcing social rights, as did,
for example, the South African Constitutional Court in mandating that its
government make broadly available a drug called Nevirapine, which inhibits the
transmissionofHIV/AIDSfrompregnantwomentotheirchildren(Tushnet2004:
1906–1907). It may be that such courts regard the anti-social rights arguments as
resembling closely those arguments against judicial review that have generally
proved unpersuasive with regard to the enforcement of ‘‘classic’’ or ‘‘negative’’Rhodesetal.:TheOxfordhandbookofPoliticalInstitutions 11-Rhodes-chap11 PageProof page 202 15.4.2006 3:05pm

constitutional rights. In addition, rights-protective courts may believe that the
anxieties about the judicial articulation of social rights can be substantially
addressedbyacknowledgingonlyrelativelymodestpowerstoenforcethoserights
through judicial decree. Mark Tushnet, for example, has noted what may
be, in some systems, a preference for combining strong articulations of social
entitlementswithrelatively weakjudicialenforcement powers (Tushnet2004).
6 Constitutional Interpretation and
Change
.........................................................................................................................................................................................
Constitutions cannot fulWll their functions simply by existing; they must be
implemented. The foundational task in implementing a constitution is interpret-
ation. Researchers have diVered profoundly in their views as to the nature of the
interpretive enterprise, and whether legal actors, most notably judges, are guided
substantially in their constitutional judgments by what the Constitution says or
rather by personal preferences externaltothe law.
The position that legal actors are wholly unconstrained by what a constitution
says seems implausible; the rules that a constitution formally embodies surely do
matter.Forexample,iftheUnitedStatesConstitutionpermittedCongresstooust
Presidents on grounds more easily demonstrated than ‘‘high crimes or misde-
meanors,’’ the balance of powers between the elected branches of the federal
government would surely be diVerent than they are today. Likewise, if the text
speciWcallystated,‘‘NeitherCongress,noranystateshallinXictasentenceofdeath
foranycrime,’’thentheUnitedStateswouldhaveadiVerentsystemofjusticefrom
the one that has developed under the more general proscription of ‘‘cruel and
unusual punishment.’’ Nonetheless, the relationship between constitutional text
and the actual behavior of governments remains diYcult to specify. Whether, for
example, Britons enjoy materially less communicative liberty than do Americans
because they lack a written Bill of Rights is debatable.9 We may wonder whether
JapanesewomenenjoygreaterequalitythandoAmericanwomen,notwithstanding
the provision of the Japanese Constitution that, ‘‘there shall be no discrimination

7 Modes of Argument
.........................................................................................................................................................................................
When a legal dispute under the United States Constitution is properly presented
forresolutiontoanAmericancourt,theprocessofinterpretingtheConstitutionis
acomplexone.Judgesfacedisagreementnotonlyastowhatvariousprovisionsof
the Constitution mean, but even as to the methods most legitimately employed,
bothingeneralandinspeciWccontexts,todiscernsuchmeaning.Thereareatleast
sixvarietiesofargumentthatregularlyappearinthewrittendecisionsofAmerican
courts interpreting the Constitution: historical arguments, textual arguments,
structural arguments, ethical arguments, doctrinal arguments, and prudential
arguments (Bobbitt 1984). Inreviewing each category,the immediate point is not
that any one method is sound, the best or even appropriate, but rather that it is
indisputably available to American courts. Thus, in facing a constitutional chal-
lengetoanyexecutiveorlegislativeact,anordinarycourtofgeneraljurisdictionis
acting in a manner consistent with conventional judicial practice in entertaining
arguments along anyoftheselines inresolving howthe Constitution applies.
Historical arguments generally appeal to what the drafters of particular consti-
tutional provisions had in mind when they added relevant text to the Constitu-
tion—or, with perhaps more justiWcation, what those who ratiWed various
proposals believed they were ratifying. Arguments of this kind—championed
prominently by such scholars as Richard Kay (1988) and Michael Perry (1996)—
are sometimes described as relying on ‘‘original intent.’’ In the American system,
thedoctrineofjudicialreviewisitselfperhapsthemostprominentexampleofthis
approach.AlthoughthetextoftheConstitutionisatbestambiguousonthepoint,
thereislittledoubtthatthosewhoadoptedtheConstitutionof1787expectedthat
federalcourtswouldhavethepowertovoidlegislationnotinconformitywiththe
new document. It was not surprising that, in 1803, the Supreme Court formallyRhodesetal.:TheOxfordhandbookofPoliticalInstitutions 11-Rhodes-chap11 PageProof page 204 15.4.2006 3:05pm
204 peter m. shane
claimed the power to set aside federal statutes it deemed to exceed Congress’s
constitutionalauthorities,eventhoughtheConstitutionnowhereexpresslyarticu-
lates the judiciary’s power to do so. Moreover, the power of judicial review was
‘‘rapidlyaccepted’’followingtheSupremeCourt’sMarburydecision10(Nowakand
Rotunda2004:11).
An important variation of historical argument is one that Lawrence Lessig has
dubbed ‘‘Wdelity as translation’’ (Lessig 1993). The core idea is that the modern
judge should provide the constitutional text whatever contemporary reading will
givethetextthesamemeaninginitscurrentcontextasitwasintendedtohavein
itsoriginalcontext(Lessig1997:1371).Totakeafancifulexample,considerthatArt.
I,section8oftheConstitutionallowsCongresstocreate‘‘anarmy’’and‘‘anavy.’’
This would seem, linguistically, to exclude the prospect of ‘‘an air force.’’ Imagine
that we now have conclusive evidence that the founding generation had actually
consideredtheprospectofhumanXightandweredeadsetagainstitasabreachof
thenaturalorder.Nonetheless,amodernjudgeshouldreadthewords‘‘army’’and
‘‘navy’’ to include ‘‘air force’’ because the framers intended the armed services
clauses to allow for an adequate national defense and, once we are aware of their
historic purpose, we should give the text a modern translation that is faithful to
thatpurpose.
Yet another variation of historical argument may also appeal to long-standing
institutional practice that may settle constitutional meaning even more deWnitely
than any extant evidence of framer design. Thus, for example, it has been under-
stood since the Wrst Washington Administration that the Senate’s power to give
advice with regard to executive-negotiated treaties is to be rendered only after
negotiations are complete, an interpretation that has prevailed chieXy because no
one has since departed from this initial institutional precedent (Shane and BruV
2005:639).
Textual arguments appeal to the wording of constitutional text, although they
may do so in diVerent ways. An ‘‘originalist’’ textual argument would appeal to a
proVered understanding of how the text would most likely havebeen understood
atthetimeofitsadoption.Thus,forexample,astatemightarguethatthebanon
‘‘cruel and unusual punishment’’should not be read in 2005 to proscribe capital
punishment because, during the late eighteenth century, the death penalty would
nothavebeenunderstoodtobe‘‘cruelandunusual.’’Thebestknownproponentof
this approach, both as a scholar and as a judge, is Associate Justice of the United
StatesSupreme Court Antonin Scalia(1997).
Atextual argument could also appeal, however, to the most reasonable current
understandingofthetext.Forexample,nooneinthelateeighteenthcenturycould
have envisioned an electronic wiretap, much less considered such a phenomenon
covered by the constitutional use of the word ‘‘search.’’ In 2005, however, anyone
10 Marburyvs.Madison,1Cranch(5U.S.)137(1803).Rhodesetal.:TheOxfordhandbookofPoliticalInstitutions 11-Rhodes-chap11 PageProof page 205 15.4.2006 3:05pm
analyzing constitutions 205
readingtheprotectionagainst‘‘unreasonablesearches’’wouldcertainlyexpectthe
words to cover electronic forms of discovery, even without physical trespass on
thesubject’sproperty.Onecouldthusmakeacontemporarytextualargumentthat
the Constitution oughtapply in suchcases.11
Textual arguments of the originalist sort may seem the same as historical
arguments based on original intent, but they depart when there is arguably a
disjunction between what the drafters anticipated and the words actually used.
For example, the text of the Constitution’s Eleventh Amendment unambiguously
precludesonlyfederallawsuitsagainstastatethatare‘‘commencedorprosecuted’’
bycitizensofanotherstateorofaforeignstate.Yet,theSupremeCourt,inaseries
of sharply divided decisions, has ruled that the amendment signals a broader
implicithistoricalunderstandingthatstateswerenottobesuableinstateorfederal
court,withouttheirconsent,whethertheplaintiVsarecitizensofanotherstate,ofa
foreign state, or of the defendant state itself (Mashaw, Merrill, and Shane 2003:
1260–8). In this context, the Court has favored the historical argument over
the textual.12
Structural arguments make appeal to ‘‘inferences from the existence of consti-
tutional structures and the relationships which the Constitution ordains among
those structures’’ (Bobbitt 1984: 74). This method was given modern scholarly
prominence with the work of Charles Black (1969), and is more recently
exempliWed in the writings of Akhil Amar (1999). A good example of the salience
of structural argument arose during the impeachment trial of President Clinton.
PresidentClinton’strialhadproceededundertheconventionalunderstandingthat
the Senate could try him only for ‘‘high crimes or misdemeanors,’’ and that
conviction would necessarily entail removal from oYce. Some of his political
opponents,however,foreseeingthathewouldnotberemovedfromoYce,argued
thatitwouldbeconsistentwiththeconstitutionaltexttorecognizeSenateauthor-
ity to convict the President for any oVense, including forms of wrongdoing that
wouldnotamountto‘‘highcrimesormisdemeanors.’’ConvictionofthePresident
forsomethinglessthana‘‘highcrimeormisdemeanor’’wouldsimplyentailsome
penalty lessonerousthan removal.
The Senate never appeared to take this possibility seriously. One of the most
telling arguments against it was presumably that the tripartite structure of the
federal government into three co-equal branches intended a kind of equilibrium
that would be unbalanced should one branch, the legislative, have the capacity to

disciplinetheheadofanother,theexecutive,onanygroundsofitschoosing.This
inference, basedon structure, likely settlesthe matterofproper interpretation.
Ethicalargument,anapproachmostprominentlyidentiWedwithRonaldDwor-
kin (1996), is an argument that seeks to impute to constitutional text its most
morallyattractiveplausiblemeaning.PerhapsthemostcelebratedSupremeCourt
decisionseeminglybasedonsuchanargumentoccurredinacasecalledBollingvs.
Sharpe(347U.S.497,1954),whichinvalidatedmandatory racialsegregationinthe
public schools in the District of Columbia. On the same day, in a series of cases
consolidated as Brown vs. Board of Education (347 U.S. 483, 1954), the Court had
held that the Fourteenth Amendment guarantee of ‘‘the equal protection of the
laws’’ invalidated mandatory racial segregation in the public schools of states.
Because the District of Columbia is not a state, however, but a federal district,
the Fourteenth Amendment did not apply. The Fifth Amendment, whichgives to
theresidentsofthefederaldistrictanequivalenttextualguaranteeof‘‘dueprocess
of law,’’ does not mention equal protection. Nonetheless, the Court in Bolling
extended the law of Brown to the District of Columbia. The Court said simply
thattherecouldbenolegitimatejustiWcationforthelegallycompelledsegregation
of the races—seemingly, a straightforward moral argument. Implicitly, the Court
was also rejecting as illegitimate the prospect that racial segregation should be
legally permitted in the United States only in the national capital, which would
have beena morally repugnantresult.
Over the years, of course, judicial decisions based on all the categories of
argument just catalogued will necessarily take on a jurisprudential life of their
own (Strauss 1996). Especially in a common law system, one would thus expect
that,overtime,constitutionaldisputeswillbegintoberesolvedinwaysthatseekto
adduce decisional principles from decided precedents, rather than from constitu-
tional text alone. This gives rise to a Wfth mode of argument, ‘‘doctrinal.’’ For
example, no United States Supreme Court decision of recent decades has stirred
more heated battle than Roe vs. Wade (410 U.S. 113, 1973), the decision that
invalidatedmoststatelawsbarringabortionintheWrsttwotrimestersofawoman’s
pregnancy.The opinion is written, however,chieXyas astraightforward doctrinal
argument. In earlier decisions, the Court had held both that a constitutionally

andthattheguaranteeofequalprotectionimplicitlyextendsthatrighttounmar-

insisted, based also on earlier cases, that states enjoy authority to regulate for the
protectionofmaternalandchildhealth,aswellasforthesafepracticeofmedicine,
even if there would be some resulting burden on a woman’s capacity to choose
abortion.
Professor Bobbitt recognizes a sixth category of argument, which he terms,
‘‘prudential,’’ namely, ‘‘constitutional argument which is actuated by the politicalRhodesetal.:TheOxfordhandbookofPoliticalInstitutions 11-Rhodes-chap11 PageProof page 207 15.4.2006 3:05pm
analyzing constitutions 207
and economic circumstances surrounding the decision’’ (Bobbitt 1982: 61). It is a
form of argument identiWed most strongly with the work of the late Alexander
Bickel (1962.) Among the most notable examples of prudential arguments are
those,whichmayalsobeavarietyofstructuralargument,thatpersuadethefederal

to awarding diplomatic recognition to the Chinese government in Beijing. Then-
Justice Rehnquist, writing for a plurality, determined that anxieties about the
potential real-world consequences should federal courts interfere with the elected
branches’ control of US foreign policy counseled for a determination that treaty
termination questions arebeyond thecourts’jurisdiction.
8 Interpretation and Legitimacy

richmenuofinterpretivepossibilitiesthatthisanalysisexposes.Championsofany
oftheseformsofargumentwillWndampleprecedentfortheiruseintherecordsof
past constitutional decisions. It hardly requires hindsight to spot the inevitability
that a constitutional law germinated through such a broad spectrum of argu-
ments—especially arguments other than those based on ‘‘original intent’’ and
‘‘original meaning’’—is likely to induce substantial changes in constitutional
meaning over time. Because the United States Constitution, as do presumably all
Constitutions, explicitly speciWes processes for its amendment, the legitimacy of
constitutional changeeVected throughother meansis opentoquestion.
The various responses of constitutional theorists to this legitimacy challenge
havetendedtofallwithinoneofthreetypes.First,thelegitimacychallengeseems

might not have speciWcally anticipated the results of particular challenges—for

death penalty for minors or that the equal protection clause would outlaw legally
mandated race segregation—the ways in which these changes have occurred,Rhodesetal.:TheOxfordhandbookofPoliticalInstitutions 11-Rhodes-chap11 PageProof page 208 15.4.2006 3:05pm
208 peter m. shane
throughtheprocedurallyacceptableapplicationofconventionaltechniquesoflegal
interpretation,wouldhavethemselvesbeenacceptabletotheframers(Powell1985).
A second line of argument is pragmatist, positing that the test of legitimacy, to
paraphrase Oliver Wendell Holmes, is experience, not logic. The Constitution of
the United States declares a variety of purposes including the establishment
of justice, the insurance of ‘‘domestic tranquility,’’ the promotion of the ‘‘general
welfare,’’andthesecuringforposterityof‘‘theblessingsofliberty.’’Inthislight,a
pragmatistwouldarguethatthelegitimacyofthejudicialfunctionasithasactually
been performed ought to be tested by whether that function has actually aided in
the Constitution’s accomplishment of those purposes. So long as the public
continues to have conWdence in its courts, so long as the United States continues
to enjoycommendable levels of peace, security, justice, and liberty,the making of
constitutional lawought tobe viewedaslegitimate.
A third line of argument roots both the objections to judge-led constitutional
changeandtoitsdefenseindemocratictheory.Fromademocraticstandpoint,the
defectofconstitutionalchangewroughtbyunelectedjudgesistheimplicitdepart-
ure from the ideal of popular sovereignty, namely, that ‘‘the people,’’ most often
through their elected representatives, should be the authors of the laws that
bind them.13 Constitutional constraints are legitimately imposed upon current
political authorities only because ‘‘the people’’ ordained the Constitution. To
permit changes to the Constitution through processes other than those ‘‘the
people’’themselves prescribed through the Constitution is to undermine popular
self-governance.
Responses to this line of argument that are rooted in democratic theory take
diVerentforms.BruceAckerman,forexample,acceptsthatsomeformofpopular
ratiWcationisnecessary tolegitimateconstitutionalchangethatoccursother than
throughtheformallyprescribedconstitutionalamendmentprocess.Retracingour

maychoosetoalteritsunderstandingofconstitutionallawifinterveningelections
signal that the people, through their civic deliberation, have demonstrated
adequatepublicsupportforadefactoamendmentoftheConstitution.Ackerman’s
paradigm case is the Court’s New Deal decisions greatly expanding the reach of
Congress’s regulatoryauthoritiesunder the CommerceClause.
Another line of theory, also resting on the premise that equates democratic
legitimacy with popular sovereignty, argues that the courts nonetheless have a
signiWcant role in reinforcing democratic rule. Pursuant to this line of thought,

forcefullyarguedbythelateJohnHartEly(1980),aparadigmexampleoflegitimate
judicial creativity would be the reapportionment cases, in which the Supreme
Court forced state legislatures to redesign electoral districts on a ‘‘one person,
onevote’’basis.Sucharesultmightbehardtosquarewithanhistoricalreadingof
the Constitution, but would be legitimate, in Ely’s view, because the result of the
decisions wastoexpandthepeople’scapacity togovern themselvesfairly through
theirelected representatives.
Thereis,however,yetathirdbrandofdemocratictheorythatstartsbychallen-
ging both the metaphor of popular sovereignty and the practical equation of
democracy with electoral accountability (Shane 2004a). Under this view, what
legitimates democratic governance are really two things: the degree to which
citizens enjoy opportunities to act meaningfully in choosing their political fate
andthedegreetowhichthesystemfosterstheequalconsiderationoftheinterests
of all persons in decision making that aVects the public at large. Elections are an
importantpartofthisequation;theyobviouslyprovidethefocusformuchofwhat
peopleexperienceasautonomouspoliticalactivity.Buttheycannotbeeverything.
Asystemcannotbelegitimate,whateveritselectoralrules,iftheinterestsofsome
are universally disregarded in favor of the interests of others, regardless of the
equity of their claims. From this point of view, constitutional law-making in
the courts functions, in part, toenergize a legitimacy-enforcing dialogue with the
elected branches. The function of this dialogue is to give voiceto interests and to
publicvaluesthat,forstructuralreasons,theelectedbranchesmightbeexpectedin
some systemic way to overlook or underweigh.14 The net result, echoing James
Madison’stheoryinthefamousFederalistPapers,No.10,istohelpinsurethatlaw

of themoment.
Closely related to these debates over the legitimacy of judicial review is the
related, but distinct question of judicial supremacy—the degree to which consti-
tutional interpretation uttered by the courts should be deemed the ‘‘Wnal say.’’
There is currently in the United States a signiWcant debate, both empirical and
normative, on the role of ‘‘popular constitutionalism.’’15 The questions are the
degree to which institutions outside the courts are also responsible for constitu-
tionalmeaningandtowhatdegreetheyshouldbeso.Thedebateadmitsofahost

authority to interpret the Constitution nonetheless embrace judicial review,
while others do not. This is a slippery debate because it is not clear exactly what

Itisquiteunlikelythatthedebatesoftwocenturiesoveraconstitution’srolesand
thewaysinwhichlegalactorsproperlyimplementthoserolesaregoingtosubside.
Moreover,becauseofbothintellectualtrendsandthepressofhistoricalevents,itis
likely that at least the following half dozen avenues of intellectual inquiry will
engage even greater attention in the coming decades’ debates over constitutional
analysis.
One is the subject of comparative constitutional analysis, which is almost
entirely beyond the domain of this chapter. The wave of democratic reform in
thenewlyconstitutedstatesoftheformerSovietUnion,inAfrica,andperhapsin
the Middle East has created a signiWcant cottage industry among legal experts
seeking to identify how various extant constitutions and their various provisions
for the structure of government and protection of individual rights have actually
fared and why(Horowitz2002). Thereis noevidence ofthattrendsubsiding.Rhodesetal.:TheOxfordhandbookofPoliticalInstitutions 11-Rhodes-chap11 PageProof page 211 15.4.2006 3:05pm

Relatedly,thereislikelytobeexcitingresearchdoneontherelationshipbetween
constitutions and the mediation of ethnic conXict. On this subject, the American
lens through which this chapter has been written is concededly too narrow. The
generationofAmericanswhodrafted,debated,andenjoyedauthoritytohelpratify
theUnitedStatesConstitutionwerearelativelyhomogeneousbunch.Althoughthe
Constitution would prove to have profound consequences for Native Americans
andforAfrican-Americans,therewasnothoughtgivenin1787to‘‘powersharing’’
with either. By contrast, power sharing in ethnically divided states is perhaps the
paramount challenge facing drafters of new constitutions in the twenty-Wrst
century. There is deep debate over the appeal of what has come to become
‘‘consociational democracy,’’ namely, some form of constitutional arrangement in
whichdiVerentethnicgroupsshareexecutivepowerproportionally,enjoysubstan-
tialgroupautonomy,andrelyonconsensusforasigniWcantportionofgovernment
decision making (compare Lijphart 2002 with Horowitz 2002). Such decisions
could be classed, if we follow the list of functions noted above, as ‘‘implementing
key founding bargains,’’ but the relationship of constitutionalism to inter-ethnic
cooperation is so complex a subject that a much more Wne-grained picture of
constitutional elementswouldbe necessary todojustice toit.
Athirdproject,fedbytheWrsttwo,islikelytobeanintensiWcationofinterestin
the relationship between constitutionalism and democratic theory. The global
proliferationofnewconstitutionalactivity,onboththenationalandsupranational
level(considertheEuropeanUnion),coincideswiththerapidgrowthofinteractive
information and communications technologies that can conceivably facilitate
whollynovelinstitutionalformsandprocessesthroughwhichcitizensmayengage
with one another and with the state in relation to public policy making (Shane
2004b). Researchers are only beginning to explore the implications of these new
technologies for democratic theory and practice, and it is easy enough to predict
that ongoing developments in democratic theory and constitutional design will
cross-pollinate signiWcantlyover thecoming decades.
A fourth project of continuing interest is likely to be the eVort, noted at the
outsetofthischapter,tosynthesizeinternalandexternalaccountsofconstitutional
interpretationtoprovideamorefullyeVectivemodelthaneithercanprovidealone
(Feldman 2005). The increasing interest among law faculties in interdisciplinary
inquiry,accompaniedbytheincreasingreceptivenessamong politicalscientiststo
accounts of judicial behavior more nuanced than the pure attitudinal model,
shouldhelpacceleratethisdevelopment.
Fifth,andrelatedtothegrowthofinterdisciplinaryinquiry,wearelikelytoseea
greater role for cognitive and decision psychology in exploring how legal actors
fulWll their roles. Research on bias, attitudes, and stereotypes is likely to inform
debates about how judges interpret the law and whether there exist structures,
processes, or techniques eVective in limiting the role of individual bias in legal
interpretation(Ferguson,Babcock,andShare2005).Similarly,giventhesigniWcantRhodesetal.:TheOxfordhandbookofPoliticalInstitutions 11-Rhodes-chap11 PageProof page 212 15.4.2006 3:05pm

prominence of critical legal studies, feminism, and critical race studies in the
United States, there is likely to be continuing interest in possible psychological
mechanisms through which legal interpretation may operate to reinforce social
hierarchiesbased onwealth,gender,race,or,indeed,all ofthe above.
Finally,andaschallengingasanyoftheothersubjects,legalscholarshipispaying
increasingattentiontotheroleofactorsotherthanjudgesingivingmeaningtothe
Constitution. Far more often than constitutional disputes reach the judiciary, the
elected branches of federal and state governments are required, in the course of
implementing their oYcial responsibilities, to determine what the Constitution
means. In many cases—perhaps most notably, at the federal level, with regard to
the proper allocation of war powers between Congress and the President—the
issues presented are unlikely ever to be addressed, much less resolved in judicial
proceedings. The role of the Constitution in such settings, the relationship, both
normative and empirical, between judicial interpretations and ‘‘extra-judicial’’
