Divyansh Sehgal1 
Abstract:  Bioinformatics is an ever-growing field due to the availability of vast database 
systems and increasing  biological data. This rapid development deals with research and 
development activities and requires adequate protection in the form of Intellectual Property 
Rights(IPR) as it adds value to the discoveries and provides incentives to the investors. The 
study includes the role of IPR in bioinformatics with a major focus on patents and related laws. 
The paper will also analyze, what type of bioinformatics are patentable, how does patent protect 
bioinformatics innovations specifically software which analyses DNA sequences. The paper 
will be presented in four parts namely, part one will consist of the introduction, while the part 
two will focus on what is bioinformatics and how it is related to IPR, part three will focus on 
the patent eligibility criteria for bioinformatics and lastly, part four will present a conclusion.  
Keywords: Bioinformatics, patents, omics, DNA sequence, Intellectual property rights. 
A.  Introduction 
The rapid developments since the last two decades in the field of biotechnology have resulted 
in new methods, products for the advancement of many sectors such as the pharmaceutical 
industry, diagnostics, environment, food tech, agriculture2. Recent sequence explosions all 
around the globe have also resulted in sequencing the whole genome of microbes, animals, 
plants while along with the explosion of sequence issues of patents about deoxyribonucleic 
acid(DNA)  and ribonucleic acid(RNA) and other related technologies3. Nowadays, the vast 
amount of information about the human genome has increased the potential of bioinformatics 
innovations worldwide as it is available online free in the databases maintained and developed 
by various bio-ventures and research organizations. Bioinformatics has many uncertainties 
when it comes to patent eligibility, some can utilize a composition of matter or is a product of 
manufacture claims but the most common bioinformatics innovations are in the field of 
software processes which is difficult to obtain4. DNA and gene-related technologies are

influencing and encouraging medical research which provides solutions to various incurable 
diseases and the development of safe and efficient drugs that are affordable.  
Biological data is growing at a fast speed, for example, the number of sequences in GenBank 
Increased from 606 in 1982 to 201,663,568 in 2017 and it doubles its size every 15 months5. 
Bioinformatics is used in numerous areas such as gene therapy, drug development, molecular 
medicine, preventive medicine, crop improvement, insect resistance studies, etc. Determining 
the function of a gene can help in making pharmaceutical drugs, but to ascertain the function 
of a gene DNA must be analyzed in sophisticated laboratory techniques and complex computer 
algorithms6. Genome research aims at the analysis of proteins that are encoded by particular 
DNA sequences, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analyses, and the mutation of genes 
that are associated with the disease7. For example treatment of a fungal infection, the researcher 
might examine its DNA or mRNA by sequencing which results in a list of genes in the human 
genome and remove the unwanted genes8.   
B.  Bioinformatics and its relation with IPR 
Bioinformatics involves programs that produce everything from a spot-picking microarray 
machine to genome-wide blast search, to complex protein modeling software packages which 
makes bioinformatics to be unique from the other disciplines of science such as computer 
science, biology, etc9. Bioinformatics deals with the collection, storage, compilation, access, 
management, and processing of information to understand the science behind DNA to find new 
treatment techniques or better drugs with reduced time and cost-efficiency.  
Definition  by  Merriam-Webster:  the  collection,  storage,  classification,  and  analysis  of 
biochemical and biological information using computers, applying to genomics10.

https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/bioinformatics  
Bioinformatics has been contributing greatly towards the fields of pharmaceuticals, agriculture, 
medicine, and drugs. The area of proteomics and genomics are dependent upon bioinformatics 
that is DNA sequencing by which vast complex biological data is converted into useful 
information which helps in the discovery of virulence factors and effective drug targets for 
ascertaining the human diseases genes11. Therefore pharmacogenomics, genomics, proteomics 
as well as other fields such as transcriptomics, metabolomics, phenomics, epigenetics along 
computer-aided  drug  design  research  are  the  components  of  bioinformatics  which  have 
transformed this field of bioinformatics to a massive commercial struggle. 
The intellectual Property right is a legal right that is given to an inventor of an original creation 
developed by his intellect, skill, and labor. As investments in R&D are increasing the stakes of 
innovators in knowledge creation have become high as IPR gives two principles for the 
development of the IPR i.e. incentives to the inventor and economic and social welfare of the 
state12. IPR protection in bioinformatics is necessary for encouraging and fostering innovation 
as a new area, as bioinformatics requires investments and investors would only be interested if 
there is an assurance to recoup their investment and as it is known that IPR protection ensures 
profits and is very helpful in bringing a drug or a therapeutic product to the market13.  
What are Genes? 
Genes are made up of stretches of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) which are founding the 
nucleus of the cell. A nucleotide is a building block of DNA and there are 4 types of nucleotides 
such as adenine (A), cytosine (C), thymine (T), and guanine (G) and in case of RNA instead of 
thymine (T), uracil (U) takes place14. Genes are specific lengths of DNA that ascertain the order 
of amino acids used to make proteins that are needed for the smooth functioning of all cells15. 
When the four nucleotides are in a certain order they are known as DNA sequence which 
contains the genetic information coding for proteins. Genetic information is a valuable input in

bioinformatics because it enables modeling of protein structure and function prediction as well 
as it allows extracting knowledgeable information from the data in molecular biology16.  
C.  Patent Eligibility of Bioinformatics in India 
In 1980, for the first time in a case Diamond v. Chakrabarty, the Supreme Court of USA 
allowed patentability of life forms by granting a patent for a recombinant bacterium17. Now the 
patentability of DNA is not permitted as in 2013 US Supreme Court in the case Association of 
Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics18 overruled the decision in Diamond v. Chakrabarty 
and held that isolated DNA is not patentable because it is a product of nature while cDNA19 is 
patentable as it is an artificial material.  
Certain guidelines issued by the Indian Patent Office (IPO) lays down the framework in respect 
of the examination of biotech applications for patents which expressed in the Indian Patent 
Law20. 
Section 3- Following are not inventions/patentable within the meaning of the law: - 
➢  Section 3(B): The innovations which are contrary to morality or which cause 
serious prejudice to human, animal or plant life or health or environment21.  
➢  Section  3(C):  A  mere  discovery  of  scientific  principle  or  any  type  of 
formulation of an abstract theory or discovery of non-living or living substances 
occurring in nature22.  
➢  Section 3(D): Discovery of enhancement of a new form of the substance of the 
known efficacy or a mere discovery of a new property or process23.

Patent eligibility of bioinformatics software in India 
The criteria of getting a patent registration of software in India is to consider the substance of 
the claim considering the entire claim together and if there is a case where process or method, 
computer program or an algorithm, etc falls under the excluded range of patents then patent 
won’t be granted until and unless where the claims are taken as a whole and don’t fall under 
the excluded category. Moreover, one vital essential to get patent for software is that the 
algorithm, computer program shouldn’t only pertain to software but also it should be linked to 
an invention which is applicable for industrial use26.  
Evolution of Omics sciences     
Development in genetics has resulted in the advancement of the sciences of omics and system 
biology. Nowadays it has become possible to ascertain the whole DNA sequence of a genome 
as well as protein sequence in an organism because of the new emerging technologies and 
bioinformatics27. Omics is the part of biotechnology which analyses the functions and methods

of the given biological functions at different levels28. Understanding the DNA and Protein is 
vital which can determine genes responsible for diseases and interaction of drugs and proteins 
are generally significant because defective proteins can be the cause for several diseases29. 
Therefore,  the  advancement  of  the  science  of  omics  such  as  Genomics,  Metabolomics, 
Epigenomics,  proteomics,  transcriptomics,  phenomics  has  become  crucial  to  understand 
human health and to be ready for any disease or any other health-related issues.

Conclusion 
Around the globe, several revolutionary changes in the field of agriculture, botany, medicine, 
and  others  have  brought  by  Bioinformatics.  Currently  while  experiencing  COVID-19 
pandemic bioinformatics can play a vital role in the development of a vaccine or therapeutic 
drug  via  DNA  sequencing.  India  is  the  first  country  worldwide  to  have  a  nationwide 
bioinformatics network (BTIS network) under the Department of Biotechnology (DBT). There 
are over 200 companies in India that are in some way or the other related to Bioinformatics31. 
A threshold of the eligibility of patent in the patent act gets faded by the patent manual 
guidelines such as in the guidelines DNA sequence claims are allowed but as per the 2013 IPO 
guidelines has curtailed the eligibility of DNA which is not isolated as it is a form of nature.  
The absence of a definition for a microorganism and computer programs plus having a lack of 
judicial precedents have resulted in the lack of clarity on patenting of Bioinformatics. The 
intention of the legislature by biotechnology and patent guidelines are not clear as well. Also, 
it is determined that software programs cannot be patented in India but bioinformatics software 
is an invention where the inventor can obtain patent protection on the method if it yields 
tangible results. Therefore, it is observed that bioinformatics is a vital area in healthcare which 
indeed needs protection. Also, considering Digital India in the future, intellectual property 
should be given a higher pedestal when it comes to the protection of inventions especially in 
the field of bioinformatics.  
In 2014, the US Supreme Court after 30 years in the case Alice Corp Pty Ltd. v. CLS Bank 
International32 ruled n what types of computer-implemented patent claims can meet the patent 
eligibility, in other words, the needs to have an “inventive concept” that will help in making 
the claimed idea into a patent.
