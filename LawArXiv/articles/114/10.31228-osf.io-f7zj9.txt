INTRODUCTION 
 
  Punitive damages have been around for centuries in classic one-on-
one tort actions and are here to stay.1  Mass torts, of more recent origin and 
not  without  difficulties2,  have  matured  to  the  point  that  this  article  is 
comfortable referring to most of them as traditional.  Notwithstanding the 
legitimacy of both institutions when employed separately, loud warning 
signals should sound when, as with drinking and driving, they are combined.3

Potentially destructive  mixes of punitive damages and mass torts have, 
unfortunately,  been  prevalent  in  traditional  mass-tort  actions.4    The 
difficulties  are  mostly  administrative.    Although  punitive  damages  are 
conceptually  compatible  with  fault-based  mass  torts,  courts  administer 
punitive awards in ways that are so capricious as to generate gross unfairness 
and inefficiency.  And if for that reason the warning signals are loud in 
connection with punitive awards in traditional mass torts, they should be 
downright deafening when courts consider awarding punitives in what this 
article refers to as emerging, nontraditional, enterprise-liability-based forms 
of mass tort.   
These  nontraditional  forms  of  claims-aggregation,  which  have  only 
recently  been  reaching  courts  in  significant  numbers,  involve  not  only 
procedural aggregation, as in traditional mass torts, but also substantive 
aggregation.  The latter occurs when courts eliminate constituent elements 
from traditional tort doctrine—most dramatically, the element of defendant’s 
fault5—to construct generic, strict liability claims brought by large numbers 
of plaintiffs against entire industries. 6  The industries that plaintiffs are 
choosing for such treatment impose significant costs on society and might be 
said to be politically incorrect; but they are lawful enterprises that presumably 
provide aggregate social benefits that exceed their costs.  Were courts to 
award punitive damages in these nontraditional mass torts such awards would 
be  sufficiently  disconnected  from  the  traditional  objective  of  punishing 
wrongdoers  as  to  justify  rejecting  them  on  substantive  as  well  as 
                                                 
Richard A. Seltzer, Punitive Damages in Mass Tort Litigation: Addressing The Problems of 
Fairness, Efficiency, and Control, 52 Fordham L. Rev. 37 (1983) (Significant reforms are 
required to allow punitive awards to survive); Catherine M. Sharkey, The Future of 
Classwide Punitive Damages, 46 U. Mich. J.L. Ref. 4, (2013) (Reforms are required for 
punitive damages awards to survive constitutional scrutiny). 
4 Courts have awarded punitive damages on a regular basis in traditional mass torts.  See, 
e.g., Grimshaw v. Ford Motor Co., 119 Cal. App. 3d 757 (Cal. App. 1981) (affirming $3.5 
million in punitive damages in Ford Pinto litigation); Owens-Corning Fiberglass Corp. v. 
Malone, 972 S. W. 2d 35 (Tex. 1998) (affirming punitives award in asbestos litigation); 
Tetuan v. A. H. Robins Co., 241 Kan. 441 (Kan. 1987).  See generally Seltzer, supra note 3 
at 38-40. 
5 As will be explained, plaintiffs often attach negligence labels to these nontraditional 
mass tort claims, but substantively most of these labels are merely window dressing. 
6 This author has argued elsewhere that the substantive bases of most of these nascent 
forms of strict enterprise liability are so vague and so dependent on broad duties to rescue as 
to be unlawful.  See James A. Henderson, Jr., The Lawlessness of Aggregative Torts, 34 
Hofstra L. Rev. 329 (2006); James A. Henderson, Jr., Requiring Sellers of Safe Products to 
Rescue Users From Risks Presented by Other, More Dangerous Products, 37 Sw. L. Rev. 
595 (2008).  If the triggers were more specific, the major objection would be the arbitrariness 
of selecting a relatively few target industries on questionable substantive grounds. In any 
event, this article assumes for the sake of argument that courts will deem some of them to be 
legitimate and challenges the propriety of awarding punitive damages in those contexts.  23-Jun-17]  James A. Henderson, Jr.  3 
administrative grounds.   
Given that these difficulties cannot be eliminated by marginal reforms, 
this article argues that punitive damages are inappropriate in, and should be 
eliminated from, all forms of mass tort.  Legislatures might accomplish this 
task  if  powerful  political  opposition  from  the  plaintiffs’  bar  could  be 
overcome.  Broad judicial proscriptions would not so directly face political 
opposition but would require courts to overrule precedent in connection with 
traditional mass torts.7  This article explains how this might be accomplished. 
In connection with emerging forms of mass tort, judicial proscriptions would 
come early enough to nip punitive awards in the bud without the need to 
overrule longstanding precedent.  Thus, if courts are going to eliminate 
punitive awards in mass torts, now is the time for them to act. 
 
I.   CONSTITUENT ELEMENTS OF THE ANALYSIS 
 
A.  Punitive Damages:  Doctrinal Triggers and Policy Objectives 
 
Courts employ a variety of formulations to identify the behaviors that 
justify punitive damages.  Among other triggers courts have required that the 
tort defendant must have acted in willful or reckless disregard of plaintiff’s 
rights;8  engaged  in  outrageous  conduct  creating  a  substantial  risk  of 
significant harm;9 acted with actual, not merely implied, malice,10 or acted 
with reckless indifference to the rights of others.11  Scholars have variously 
summarized these doctrinal triggers as referring to especially opprobrious 
behavior,12 abuses of power,13 and differing levels of heinousness.14  A 
majority of courts and commentators agree that only defendants who are 
egregiously  blameworthy  deserve  to  be  punished  in  this  manner.  Mere 
negligence, or even gross negligence, will not suffice.15  Moreover, whatever

the operative trigger, courts in virtually every jurisdiction give triers of fact—
juries  in  most  cases—wide  latitude  in  determining  the  size  of  punitive 
damages awards.16  As will be developed in a subsequent discussion, this 
latitude is so wide that it may be said to interfere with attaining the objectives 
of awarding punitive damages in the first place.17 
What social objectives are served by awarding punitive damages?  
The answer from scholars is nearly unanimous: punitive damages primarily 
aim to achieve retribution and deterrence.18  Retribution is best conceived as 
a backward-looking end-in-itself, based on the moral concept of just desert.  
Bad actors deserve to be punished.19  By contrast, deterrence is a forward-
looking  means-to-an-end,  serving  to  reduce  future,  inefficiently-harmful 
conduct by the defendant and others.20    Most  tort  scholars  agree  that 
imposition of punitive damages may serve a combination of retribution and 
deterrence.21  Some have articulated other objectives that justify punitive 
awards, including filling gaps in compensatory damages coverage—e.g., 
paying the plaintiff’s otherwise uncompensated attorneys’ fees—in order to 
achieve proper levels of deterrence.22  A leading authority rejects this view, 
arguing that the preferable solution to doctrinal shortcomings is to expand the 
                                                 
16 See, e.g., Pacific Mutual Ins. Co. v. Haslip, 499 U.S. 2, 18 (1991) (“One must concede 
that unlimited jury discretion . . . in the fixing of punitive damages may invite extreme results 
that  jar  one’s  constitutional  sensibilities.”)    See  generally  Peter  H.  Schuck,  Judicial

Action, 80 Temple L. Rev. 1013, 1022 (2007).

A Punitive Damages Overview:  Functions, Problems and Reform, 39 Vill. L. Rev. 363, 375-
78 (1994); Dorsey D. Ellis, Jr., Fairness and Efficiency in the Law of Punitive Damages, 56 
So. Calif. L. Rev. 1, 4-10 (1982). 
19 See Ellis, supra note 18 at 8:   
Punishment in the form of retribution . . . implies desert, which in turn requires 
that the person being punished must, by a fair procedure, be found to have chosen 
to commit an act that has been authoritatively declared wrongful.  Punishment of 
proportionally appropriate severity must be prescribed beforehand ex ante and 
applied on an equal basis to all offenders.  Retribution is backward-looking (ex post) 
and provides a complete reason for imposing a detriment. 
20 See id. at 8-9: 
[Deterrence]  require[s]  an  assessment  of  whether  the  costs  incurred  by 
imposing a detriment on a defendant will be offset by a reduction in the expected 
losses to society from future harmful acts. . . .  Compensatory damages ordinarily 
would  appear  to  be  sufficient  to  promote  efficient  levels  of  deterrence.  
Accordingly, deterrence objectives justify imposing punitive damages only in cases 
where compensatory damages alone produce less than optimal deterrence.

22 See, e.g., Ellis, supra note 18 at 3, and text accompanying n.10; 23-Jun-17]  James A. Henderson, Jr.  5 
scope of compensatory damages rather than to employ punitive damages to 
perform  a  gap-filling  function  having  no  necessary  connection  with 
wrongdoing.23  A related justification for punitives is that they help to counter 
underdeterence resulting from defendants engaging in efforts to conceal their 
harmful wrongdoing.24  In such a circumstance, it is argued, punitive awards 
are appropriate because they are linked logically to deceptive, antisocial 
conduct. 
  Some scholars, especially of the law-and-economics variety, justify 
punitive damages as a means by which to internalize the costs of inherently 
risky enterprises, thereby helping to achieve more efficient levels of care and 
activity via general deterrence.25  Because many of the enterprises to which 
this  rationale  applies  are  lawful,  socially  beneficial—albeit  inherently 
risky—enterprises,26 efficiency analysts face a daunting task trying to link 
cost-internalization  to  the  traditional,  wrongfulness-based  triggers  for 
punitive damages.27 To be sure, a few individual defendants who are joined 
in mass torts will have acted especially badly in ways that relate uniquely to 
them.  But it is a stretch to insist that operating a lawful, albeit risky, business 
should, in itself, constitute sufficiently wrongful behavior to justify punitive 
damages.28  The best that plaintiffs may be able to come up with is to argue 
that engaging in business enterprises that foreseeably and unavoidably—
albeit not necessarily wrongfully—cause harm to others constitutes the sort 
                                                 
23 See Schwartz, supra note 18 at 139-140. 
24 See Ellis, supra note 18 at 25.  When actors make conscious efforts to conceal their 
wrongdoing, they are less likely to be caught in the act, so to speak.  For the minority who 
are caught, imposing a penalty greater than compensatories is appropriate in order to bring 
the expected value of the threatened penalty up to an appropriate level. 
25 See, e.g., A. Mitchell Polinsky and Steven Shavell, Punitive Damages:  An Economic 
Analysis, 111 Harv. L. Rev. 869-901 (1998).  For a fairly full explanation of the theory 
underlying enterprise liability see generally supra note 12, Henderson at 502-07.  In brief, 
enterprise liability raises the costs of engaging in the relevant activities, thereby lowering the 
level of engagement.  One of the problems with enterprise liability is maintaining workable 
boundaries. See James A. Henderson, Jr., The Boundary Problems of Enterprise Liability, 
41 Md. L. Rev. 659 (1982). 
26 See infra text accompanying notes 43 and 45. 
27 Cost internalization is usually associated with strict liability, not with fault.  See supra 
note 24.  See also infra note 66, citing and quoting Dan Markel. 
28 The nonnegligent operation of a business is a classic trigger for strict enterprise 
liability.  See generally Gregory C. Keating, The Theory of Enterprise Liability and Common 
Law Strict Liability, 54 Vand. L. Rev. 1285, 1286 (2001) (“Enterprise liability pins . . . 
accident costs on the activity—the enterprise—which imposed the nonnegligent risks 
responsible for the injuries at issue.”) As subsequent discussions relating to emerging mass 
torts make clear (see infra notes 39-109 and text accompanying) courts in recent years have 
held members of certain industries liable for punitive damages based on their participation 
in those industries. 6  PUNITIVE DAMAGES IN MASS TORT  [23-Jun-17 
of disregard and indifference that some courts have held to be sufficient bases 
upon which to award punitive damages.29   
  Consistent with the preceding observations, a majority of scholars 
embrace retribution based on desert as the predominant rationale for punitive 
damages.30  Professor Gary Schwartz’s work stands out for the clarity with 
which he articulates his preference for the punishment/retribution rationale.31  
Having  reviewed  the  work  of  other  prominent  writers  and  the  relevant 
judicial decisions, he concludes: “The deterrence theory thus badly fails the 
descriptive test: there is almost nothing in the common law of punitive 
damages that it clarifies, and there are central features in that law that it 
contradicts.”32  Schwartz proceeds to consider characteristics of the common 
law that the punishment/retribution rationale for punitives helps to explain 
and justify, among them the distinctly moral nature of the doctrinal triggers 
and the way that a defendant’s degree of reprehensibility and wealth help to 
determine the appropriate size of a punitive award.33  He also discusses 
several ways that the retribution rationale runs into practical difficulties.34  
Some of these difficulties will be considered in a subsequent discussion in 
Part II regarding the proper role of punitives in traditional, fault-based mass 
torts.

Mostly Fault-Based Claims

Rev. 957 (2007).  The latter two authors seem to stress moral vindication of the victims of 
wrongdoing rather than simply retributive punishment of the wrongdoers.  In any event the 
two concepts are opposite sides of the same coin.  See Dan Markel, How Should Punitive 
Damages Work?, 157 U. Pa. L. Rev. 1383, 1418-1419 (2009).

  Mass torts date back to the sixties when reforms in federal civil 
procedure  began  to  allow  the  procedural  aggregation  of  cases  sharing 
common issues of fact and law.  These procedural aggregations, which 
included class actions and multidistrict consolidations, aimed primarily to 
achieve efficiency by allowing common issues to be tried simultaneously.35  
Many of the early mass torts involved class actions, with a single defendant 
and multiple plaintiffs, based on traditional, fault-based tort law.36  Plaintiffs 
included claims for punitive damages that, because the underlying claims for 
compensatory damages are based on traditional tort doctrine, fit conceptually 
within the fault-based action as a whole.  For example, a prescription drug 
manufacturer found to have failed to warn of a serious risk unknown to the 
medical profession but of which the drug company knew should pay punitive 
damages to the many consumers injured by the drug.37  As will be explained 
in Part II, infra, punitive damages in traditional mass torts present serious 
administrative  problems  that  have  led  critics  to  urge  their  substantial 
restriction or elimination.38  However, given that the underlying tort claims 
in traditional mass torts are fault-based, no fundamental disconnect exists 
between their compensatory and punitive aspects. 
 
2.  Emerging, Nontraditional Mass Torts: Substantive Aggregation on the 
Road to Strict Enterprise Liability 
 
a.  A Brief Overview of Nontraditional Mass Torts 
 
  These nontraditional mass torts, most of which date back less than 
thirty years,39 are based on innovative claims that ask courts to eliminate 
                                                 
35 See generally Mary J. Davis, Toward the Proper Role of Mass Tort Class Actions, 77 
Or. L. Rev. 157, 168-186 (1998); Stanley J. Levy, Complex Multidistrict Litigation and the 
Federal Courts, 40 Fordham L. Rev. 41 (1971). 
36 These characteristics emphasize that early mass torts involved aggregation only in the 
procedural dimension.  A single defendant’s egregious conduct happened to harm many 
victims in a fundamentally similar way.  Courts allowed joinder of many claims as a means 
of reducing costs and achieving consistent outcomes.  See supra note 3, Richard A. Seltzer, 
52 Fordham L. Rev. at 37-38. 
37 See, e.g., Roginsky v. Richardson-Merrell, Inc., 378 F.2d 832 (2d Cir. 1967); Desiano 
v. Warner-Lambert & Co., 467 F.3d 85 (2d Cir. 2006); Forman v. Novartis Pharms. Corp., 
793 F. Supp. 2d 598 (E.D.N.Y. 2011).  For an analysis of related preemption issues see

Litigation and Punitive Damages Preemption, April 2013 Defense Council J. 123 (2013).

39 Beginning with traditional mass tort formats, asbestos litigation dates back more than 
fifty years and serves as the flagship for mass torts generally.  See infra notes 48 and 49 and 
text accompanying. 8  PUNITIVE DAMAGES IN MASS TORT  [23-Jun-17 
important  doctrinal  elements  such  as  defect,  fault,  and  causation  from 
traditional tort theories.   These new doctrines aim to impose liability on 
entire industries, through their members, for harms caused to multitudes of 
plaintiffs by the generic risks that those industries present to the public.40  
This author has elsewhere observed that these new torts rest on alleged duties 
of industry members to rescue the public from the consequences of desirable-
but-dangerous commercial activities, and has argued that they present courts 
with vague, open-ended (and therefore mainly unadjudicable) issues.41  This 
article accepts the reality that plaintiffs will continue to pressure courts to 
recognize these nontraditional causes of action and assumes for the sake of 
argument that some of these efforts will be successful.42  
 
b.  Examples of Emerging, Nontraditional Mass Torts 
 
  In the following examples, plaintiffs bring mass tort actions against 
all, or the largest, of the companies within established industries whose 
products and other commercial outputs their critics claim are of questionable 
social value.  Many of these actions impose the functional equivalent of 
general duties to rescue and seek to recover pure economic losses rather than 
damages for personal injuries.43  Although plaintiffs often dress these claims 
in the rhetorical clothing of traditional, fault-based tort theory, all of them 
involve modifications of existing tort doctrine to create new theories that are 
particularly  amenable  to  collective,  mass  tort  treatment.44    By  bringing 
potentially existential attacks on socially questionable industries, plaintiffs 
appear to be seeking large settlements that have the potential to transform 
litigation processes into massive compensation systems45 by means of which

Products, 49 Tenn. L. Rev. 61 (1981); see Note, From Tobacco to Health Care and Beyond—

41 See supra note 6; Henderson, infra note 54. 
42 Among recent plaintiffs’ successes are claims against what are often referred to as 
peripheral  asbestos  defendants—manufacturers  of  workplace  products  that  do  not 
themselves contain asbestos but are foreseeably used post-sale with asbestos-containing 
products manufactured and distributed by others  In these cases the asbestos-containing add-
on products cause harms for which the peripheral defendants are held liable, ostensibly for 
failing to warn of the asbestos-related risks..  See infra notes 54-59 and text accompanying.

injury increases of risk following toxic exposure); 85 (new forms of public nuisance); and

45 One example of a failed attempt to achieve this objective via federal statute was the 
so-called FAIR Act, which aimed to replace asbestos litigation with an administrative 
compensation system.  The Act failed of passage in 2006. See generally Jeb Barnes, Dust-

not only are existing plaintiffs’ claims paid but also future plaintiffs’ rights 
are foreclosed and  trial dockets are cleared.46 
i.  Asbestos-Containing Products Industries 
 
  Asbestos  litigation  provides  a  paradigm  for  the  doctrinal 
developments described in this article.47   Beginning in the mid-1960s, as 
epidemiological studies revealed that exposures to asbestos fibers cause 
cancer, plaintiffs began to bring traditional tort actions against individual 
commercial asbestos suppliers for negligent failures to warn.48  These early 
cases were fault-based personal injury actions, of both individual and class-
action  varieties,  that  did  not  require  any  significant  modifications  of 
traditional tort doctrines.49  By the early 1980s such claims were sufficiently 
numerous to force the major asbestos supplier to declare bankruptcy, and

Gradually,  first  facing  the  depletion  and  then  the  exhaustion  of 
solvent companies that sold products containing asbestos, plaintiffs began to 
modify traditional tort claims to maintain an uninterrupted stream of asbestos 
litigation.  During this transitional period, which continues, mass tort actions 
evolved from traditional to nontraditional forms.  Thus, plaintiffs who could 
not identify the particular sources of asbestos to which they had been exposed 
joined groups of defendants within a given asbestos-related industry and 
invoked various theories of collective responsibility.52  Plaintiffs argued that 
because exposures to asbestos from various sources over periods of years had 
cumulative deleterious effects, any substantial exposure to a defendant’s 
products should suffice to hold that defendant jointly and severally liable with 
others within the same industry even though the exposure to defendant’s 
product was not sufficient, by itself, to cause plaintiff’s injury.53 
  During the past several decades, asbestos plaintiffs have pressured 
courts  to  accept  other  doctrinal  expansions  aimed  at  providing  fresh 
categories of defendants by which to extend asbestos litigation into the 
indefinite future.  One such expansion imposes tort liability, ostensibly on the 
basis of failure to warn, beyond distributors of asbestos-containing products 
to include defendants who distribute products that do not themselves contain 
asbestos but are used post-sale in combination with asbestos-containing 
products that cause injury.  In effect, these claims require defendants to rescue 
the victims and potential victims of asbestos-containing products distributed 
by others. 54  The New York Court of Appeals recently affirmed judgment for 
plaintiff in a failure-to-warn action against the manufacturer of pump valves 
for harm caused by asbestos-containing gaskets manufactured and distributed 
by  an  unrelated  company  and  installed  by  the  purchasers  of  the  pump 
valves.55  A concurring judge joined the outcome on appeal but argued for a

more limited liability rule defining in specific fashion when a manufacturer 
must warn of the risks presented by another manufacturer’s product.56  The 
concurring judge expressed concern that courts may expand the test for 
liability to the point that mere foreseeability that a defendant’s asbestos-free 
products  may  be  combined  in  some  fashion  with  asbestos-containing 
products will suffice to hold the defendant manufacturer responsible for 
asbestos-caused injuries.57   
  Several further  revisions of tort  doctrine carry the possibility of 
promoting nontraditional mass torts.  The first increases the categories of 
injuries, besides personal injury and property damage, for which successful 
asbestos plaintiffs may recover.  Over the last decade plaintiffs have sought, 
prior to manifesting injury from exposures, to recover compensation for 
increases in their risks of future injury;58 mental distress at being placed at 
higher risk;59 and medical monitoring costs necessary to detect asbestos-
related illnesses at their earliest stage.60  Plaintiffs relying on these doctrinal 
expansions have met with limited success.61  Another example involves new 
definitions of property damage and extensions of public nuisance law that 
shift the high costs of asbestos abatement from property owners (often public

examples involving increased risk, mental distress, and medical monitoring, 
these new theories raise problems that have led courts to hesitate.63  But 
plaintiffs’ persistence causes the future to be uncertain. 
  Before considering targets other than the asbestos industry, a brief 
summary will be useful.  Asbestos claims in the 1960s and 1970s were based 
on traditional tort theory—asbestos sellers had allegedly failed to warn of 
hidden risks of which they knew full well.  However, beginning with the 
Manville bankruptcy and subsequent Plan of Reorganization, the culpability 
of industry members who willfully distribute asbestos-containing products 
has  been  more  or  less  taken  for  granted64  and  the  important  issues  in 
emerging, nontraditional mass torts have concerned causation, elements of 
recovery, and the question of which defendants could be considered members 
of the relevant asbestos industry.65  Currently, actions seeking to impose 
asbestos liability have, empty rhetoric aside, very little to do with anyone’s 
moral fault and everything to do with the amoral reallocation of losses and 
costs from mostly innocent victims to mostly innocent enterprises.66

Nuisance:  Maintaining Rational Boundaries on a Rational Tort, 45 Washburn L.J. 541, 553

63 Id.  See also Tioga Pub. Sch. Dist. v. U.S. Gypsum Co., 984 F.2d 915 (8th Cir. 1993). 
64 By the time that Manville declared bankruptcy, the substantial cancer risks presented 
by asbestos fibers were common knowledge and were assumed to have been discoverable 
earlier, and virtually no defendants had, up to that point issued any kind of warnings.  In 
effect, the asbestos industry had been caught off-base and red-handed.  Moreover, so-called 
tertiary defendants such as pump manufacturers had not warned because they never received 
adequate notice that they might be liable for products they had not distributed.  See infra 
notes 193-198 and text accompanying. 
65 See supra notes 54-57 and text accompanying. 
66 The asbestos liability story could be said to consist of three chapters.  In the first, 
commercial asbestos-product distributors such as Johns Manville were held liable on the 
basis of failure to warn (see supra notes 46-49 and text accompanying) under circumstances 
where the issue of fault was quite disputable.  The second chapter covers the period from the 
nineties until present, where the issue of defendants’ fault fell out of the mass tort liability 
picture almost entirely (see supra notes 64 and 65 and text accompanying).  The third chapter, 
referenced in the text accompanying this note, involves what are here referred to as emerging 
mass torts, in which peripheral defendants are being threatened with potentially sweeping 
liability (see supra notes 54-57 and text accompanying) although they never distributed an 
asbestos-containing product.  See supra notes 54-57 and text accompanying.  On the subject 
of the dispassionate nature of punitive damages as a cost-internalization device see Dan 
Markel, How Should Punitive Damages Work?, 157 U. Pa. L. Rev. 1383, 1412 (2009) 
(“Deterrence damages are a purely nonstigmatic, ‘cool’ cost internalization device.  They do 
not “punish” a defendant any more than state incorporation fees “punish” a defendant.”) 23-Jun-17]  James A. Henderson, Jr.  13 
ii.  The Tobacco Industry 
 
  Tobacco  is  a  high-profile  example  of  a  lawful,  but  disfavored, 
industry against which plaintiffs have brought expansionary, nontraditional 
mass  torts.    As  with  asbestos,  plaintiffs  based  their  earliest  efforts  on 
traditional theories of failure to warn.  Unlike asbestos, however, these early 
actions were entirely unsuccessful.67  One of the more spectacular of the 
subsequent  expansions  into  nontraditional  liability  involved  claims  by 
governmental units at the local, state, and federal levels against tobacco 
industry  members  for  having,  merely  by  lawfully  distributing  their 
nondefective products, increased the costs of maintaining public welfare 
systems.  The best-known examples were claims brought by the attorneys 
general of a large number of states against members of the tobacco industry 
seeking  reimbursement,  on  essentially  unjust  enrichment  grounds,  of 
tobacco-related health care expenditures by their states.68   
  The soundness of the unjust enrichment theory invoked in these cases 
was questionable, but the stakes were huge.  Perhaps in part reflecting the 
crapshoot aspects, the parties entered into a Master Settlement Agreement in 
1998  calling  for  payment  of  $246  billion  to  the  states  and  to  the 
nongovernmental lawyers who had managed the litigation.69  Other actions 
along similar lines followed.  In one of them the federal government brought 
an unjust enrichment action based on the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt 
Organizations Act (RICO).70  The government sought disgorgement of $280 
billion that the tobacco industry had allegedly received over a 30-year period 
while concealing the addictive qualities of cigarettes.71  After the federal 
district court denied defendants’ motion for summary judgment and certified 
the case for interlocutory appeal, the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit 
reversed on the ground that RICO does not provide for disgorgement-type 
remedies.72 
  One more example of how the tobacco industry has been the target of 
nontraditional mass tort actions deserves mention.  From the 1970s into the

72 See Id., Phillip Morris U.S.A., 396 F.3d at 1193. 14  PUNITIVE DAMAGES IN MASS TORT  [23-Jun-17 
1990s, tobacco companies labeled some cigarettes “light” and “lowered tar 
and nicotine.”73  With grounds for suspecting that these labels misrepresented 
the relevant safety levels, plaintiffs might have brought traditional class 
actions to recover for smoking-related personal injuries that would have been 
avoided had the defendants not falsely promised greater safety.  However, 
courts might very well have refused to certify such classes because of the 
absence of commonality regarding the personal injuries suffered by the 
smoker-plaintiffs.74 Thus, plaintiffs transformed traditional mass tort actions 
into new, expansionary actions seeking recovery for the economic losses 
incurred by light cigarette smokers who claimed they had paid too much for 
what they erroneously believed were safer cigarettes.75  Unlike personal 
injuries, which would vary from plaintiff to plaintiff, the economic nature of 
the losses caused them to be fairly uniform across the entire class.  The 
amount of the losses varied, but their nature was uniform.  To be sure, tobacco 
industry  management  had  lied  to  Congress  shortly  before  plaintiffs 
commenced these mass tort actions.76  But even if that misconduct helped to 
create  the  public  image  of  the  tobacco  industry  as  “Peck’s  bad  boy,” 
technically those lies did not serve as the legal basis for recovery.77  Although 
results in these actions have been mixed,78 there may be reasons for plaintiffs 
to be optimistic regarding future prospects.79

United States:  2007, William Mitchell College of Law Legal Studies Research Paper No. 
88 (2007); supra note 67, James A. Henderson, Jr. at 91-93. 
74 Rule 23(a)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure sets forth the requirement that, 
for a class to be certified, there must be questions of law or fact “common to the class.”  See 
Wal-Mart Stores v. Dukes, 131 S.Ct. 2541 (2011) (review and discussion of commonality 
requirement).  Individually-oriented fraud claims would have required a plaintiff to establish 
that he did not know that the representations of lower tar and nicotine were false, that he 
relied reasonably on the representations, and that his reliance caused him to suffer harm 
(including economic harm).  All of these elements of the tort would have varied from plaintiff 
to plaintiff, thus destroying the necessary commonality. 
75 See supra note 73, Price v. Phillip Morris U.S.A. Inc.  The commonality requirement 
was satisfied because, once the court approved a formula by which to measure the overcharge 
per pack of cigarettes, the claims became, essentially, claims of unjust enrichment that 
eliminated the need to prove reasonable reliance or individual personal injury.

iii.   The Lead Pigment Industry 
 
  Mass tort actions against members of the lead pigment industry reflect 
these same patterns.  A major front in the growing mass-tort wars is being 
fought in public nuisance actions commenced by units of government to shift 
to the lead pigment industry the costs of abating lead-based paint in public 
buildings.80  In the 1980s, traditional products liability abatement claims by 
nongovernmental  plaintiffs  against  lead  pigment  distributors  routinely 
failed.81  More recently, plaintiffs have relied on the concept of public 
nuisance, recast and stretched thin to the point of being synonymous with 
“interference with a public right [including any] lawful activity conducted in 
such a manner that it imposes costs on others.”82  The breadth of this 
expansive redefinition of public nuisance doctrine has prompted one critic 
mockingly to label it as a “super tort.”83  Most of the buildings in these lead 
pigment mass actions are old and are painted with pigments from many 
different sources.  Because adequate records are almost never available, 
causation is a difficult issue.84  Not surprisingly, the results in these actions 
have been mixed, with plaintiffs losing many more claims than they have 
won.85  But given the large sums at stake, the plaintiffs’ bar are quite likely 
to maintain their efforts.86 
iv.  The Firearms Industry 
 
  Nontraditional  mass  torts  have  also  drawn  aim  on  the  firearms 
industry.87  Of all the proposed extensions of liability, this one is most

firearm manufacturers liable and making an argument regarding how the tort system can be 
used to complement legislatures and administrative agencies in regulating the firearm 
industry). 16  PUNITIVE DAMAGES IN MASS TORT  [23-Jun-17 
obviously  based  on  an  expansive,  nontraditional  duty  to  rescue.    The 
plaintiffs insist that members of the firearms industry owe a duty to market 
their products so as to rescue the public from gun-related criminal activity by 
unrelated third parties. The two theories most often invoked, with limited 
success thus far, are negligent marketing88 and public nuisance.89  Causes of 
action based on negligent marketing allege that the defendant companies—
usually the major firearms suppliers in a geographic area—market their 
products  in  ways  that  should  alert  them  that  their  weapons  are  being 
channeled to dangerously unlawful activities.90  Plaintiffs assert that the 
failure of the firearms industry to stop these destructive patterns of gun 
distribution constitutes negligence, for which industry members must be 
liable in tort to the families of those injured and killed by the unlawful use of 
handguns.  Moreover, because it is nearly impossible to trace the weapon 
used in a particular incident back to its distributors; and because members of 
the industry employ essentially the same methods of distribution; plaintiffs 
rely on theories of collective causation that would apportion responsibility 
among industry members according to market shares or otherwise.91 
  In a well-known example of this sort of nontraditional mass tort, 
plaintiffs brought their negligent marketing action in a federal district court 
in New York, where they won a substantial verdict and judgment against a 
group of firearm industry members.92  On appeal, the federal court certified

reasonable care in marketing their products; the second asked whether, if so, 
liability may be apportioned on the basis of market share.93  The New York 
high court answered the first of these questions in the negative, leading the 
federal court of appeals to reverse the judgment below.94  The other doctrinal 
basis upon which plaintiffs have brought mass tort actions against members 
of the firearms industry is public nuisance.  Here the focus is not on gun 
manufacturers’  negligence  but  on  the  negative  social  impacts  of  illegal 
secondary gun markets, which the firearms industry makes possible but does 
not  undertake  to  control.95    In  one  well-known  decision  approving  the 
plaintiff’s nuisance claim, the Indiana Supreme Court made clear that it was 
embracing  a  new  legal  theory  aiming  to  internalize  the  social  costs  of 
maintaining a firearms industry, with those costs being reflected in the prices 
charged for that industry’s products.96

beverages,100 and health care.101  As noted earlier, these industries, while 
lawful and beneficial, share the characteristic of being suspect in the eyes of 
many citizens.102  Plaintiffs exploit these public sentiments, in all likelihood 
hoping (and at some point no doubt expecting) to reach global settlements 
similar to those reached with the asbestos and tobacco industries.103  Rather 
than necessarily aiming to destroy the targeted industries via fault-based 
claims that drive them into bankruptcy, plaintiffs seek to tax the industries in 
the name of cost-internalization, creating trust funds out of which each 
industry’s victims may receive no-fault compensation and their lawyers may 
be paid their fees. 
  Products  liability  law  provides  another  potential  pathway  for 
plaintiffs to impose industry-wide enterprise liability.  Under traditional 
doctrine, a defendant is liable for harm caused by a product design if, but only 
if, the plaintiff can prove that a reasonable, safer alternative design was 
available and that the defendant manufacturer’s failure to adopt the safer 
alternative rendered the defendant’s design not reasonably safe.104  Plaintiffs 
seeking to impose strict enterprise liability assert that the inherent generic 
risks presented by a broad product category are unreasonable even though 
there was no reasonable, safer alternative design available at the time of 
distribution.105  And once the focus shifts to the industry that distributes such 
unavoidably dangerous products, political incorrectness replaces fault as the 
primary factor determining liability.  In a case in Iowa the plaintiff, who had 
suffered injury on defendant’s trampoline, brought an action claiming that all 
trampolines are inherently unreasonable in design because they all involve 
inherent risks of harm that cannot be eliminated by altering the designs.  The

succeeded  and  if  most  courts  had  followed  suit,  then  every  trampoline

users foreseeably suffered harm.  This author has argued elsewhere against 
this  proposed  “product  category  liability,”  107  and  courts  thus  far  have 
agreed.108  But as the plaintiffs’ bar continue to bring these mass tort claims 
against unpopular industries such as tobacco and firearms, strict enterprise 
liability may be on the products liability horizon.  
 
  Ostensibly, the actions described above seek to internalize the social 
costs of politically incorrect commercial enterprises, thereby accomplishing 
general, or market, deterrence.  In effect, the plaintiffs’ bar seek to impose a 
risk tax on selected industries, receiving generous fees for their troubles.  This 
article does not argue that these emerging mass tort actions are unlawful.  It 
assumes for the sake of argument that courts will accept some of them and 
addresses the further question of whether these actions—or mass tort actions 
more generally—should include awards of punitive damages.  These are the 
subjects to which Parts II and III now turn. 
 
II.   PUNITIVE DAMAGES ARE UNWORKABLE AND UNFAIR IN  
MASS TORTS GENERALLY 
 
A.  The Problems Punitives Present 
 
  The problems punitive damage awards present in mass torts generally, 
including traditional and nontraditional forms, stem in some measure from a 
clash of philosophical perspectives.  On the one hand, mass torts are an 
impersonal, dispassionate means to the ends of reducing transaction costs and 
treating  like  cases  alike.    Once  a  civil  justice  system  commits  to  the 
procedural aggregation of similar claims, to a significant extent it commits to 
an off-the-rack, one-size-fits-all administrative approach in place of tailor-
made, personalized justice.109  By contrast, punitive damages traditionally

punish  injurers  and  vindicate  their  victims  individually  rather  than 
collectively.  Given these different perspectives, it is hardly surprising that 
problems of the sorts described below should arise. 
 
1.  Juries Award Punitive Damages Capriciously 
 
  Capriciousness  in  decisionmaking  implicates  outcomes  that  are 
unpredictable and subject to whim in the sense that they are not tied logically 
to any applicable standards.110  In the context of punitive damages awards in 
mass torts, capriciousness is primarily a function of inexperienced lay juries 
applying vague legal standards in a trial setting containing many elements 
that are quite emotional.111  Juries sit for one case only and cannot draw on 
previous  experiences    in  similar  cases.112    Regarding  the  vagueness  of 
applicable standards, recall that many states allow juries in traditional mass 
tort cases to award punitive damages if they find the defendant to have acted 
with  willful  disregard  of,  or  reckless  indifference  toward,  the  rights  of 
others.113  Even morally-innocent, socially-beneficial corporate behavior that 
exposes  many  persons  to  nontrivial  risks  may,  with  hindsight,  be 
characterized  as  disregarding  and  indifferent.    Moreover,  corporate 
defendants  often  reach  important  management  decisions  by  a  sensible 
process of cost-benefit analysis that may be callous and even cruel to lay 
jurors at trial.114  Given the latitude trial courts give juries to grant punitive 
damages,115 juries might well return sizeable punitive damages verdicts in 
any of the mass tort actions described thus far.  Judicial review at trial or on 
appeal may reduce some very large awards, but seemingly random risks of 
                                                 
whole.”) 
110 Webster’s New World Dictionary defines “capricious” as “inclined to change 
abruptly and without reason; erratic; flighty; unpredictable.” 
111 Plaintiffs in mass torts choose juries over judges most of the time.  See generally 
Kevin  M.  Clermont  &  Theodore  Eisenberg,  Trial  by  Jury  or  Judge:  Transcending 
Empiricism, 77 Cornell L. Rev. 1124, 1141 (1992) (statistics relating to medical malpractice 
and products liability cases). Regarding emotional elements at trial, see supra notes 8-14 and 
text accompanying. 
112 See Neil Vidmer, Medical Malpractice and the American Jury:  Confronting the 
Myths About Jury Incompetence, Deep Pockets, and Outrageous Damage Awards 162, n.3. 
(1995) (“[J]uries can never be as effective as specialized triers of fact . . . because jurors are 
exposed to the medical issues only once; consequently, they cannot develop an institutional 
memory to aid them in deciding a specific dispute.) 
113 See supra notes 8 and 11 and text accompanying. 
114 See, e.g., Grimshaw v. Ford Motor Co., 119 Cal. App. 3d 757, 813 (1981) (substantial 
punitive award affirmed on ground that cost-benefit analysis, balancing human lives against 
profits, constituted callous indifference and conscious disregard.) 
115 See supra note 16 and text accompanying. 23-Jun-17]  James A. Henderson, Jr.  21 
crushing liability remain. 116  This unpredictability is unfair to both plaintiffs 
and defendants.117  More fundamentally, capriciousness is bad for the tort 
system; it is antithetical to the very concept of the rule of law.118 
  Threats of blockbuster punitive damages also produce undesirable 
deterrent effects on corporate defendants’ behavior, both ex ante and ex post 
of bringing a mass tort action.  Ex ante, the threat of existential punitive 
awards  coming  down  like  thunderbolts  on  a  nice  day  tends  to  inhibit 
innovation and long-term planning.119  Ex post of the commencement of a 
mass tort action, the risk of suffering a crushing punitive damages penalty 
gives rise to so-called “blackmail settlements” in which defendants pay more 
than the relevant mass tort claims are reasonably worth.120  Most of the 
shareholders of widely-held public corporations are highly diversified and 
thus  risk  neutral.121    As  such,  given  good  information  and  adequate 
bargaining skills, they could be expected to settle at close to reasonable 
values—what the claims are reasonably calculated to be worth at the outset

Punitive Damages, 111 Mich. L. Rev. 33, 35 (2012) (“Although punitive damages are seldom 
awarded in tort cases and the median award is less than the median compensatory damages 
award, the variance in awards is great, and the other cases subject defendants to punitive 
damages that dwarf the corresponding compensatories.”); W. Kip Viscusi, The Social Costs

(“[Defendants in mass tort actions] may not wish to roll [the] dice. . . .  They will be under 
intense pressure to settle. . . . Judge Friendly . . . called settlements insured by a small 
probability of an immense judgment in a class action blackmail settlements.”)  In the context 
of insurers’ potential liabilities for huge verdicts in excess of policy limits, co-authors 
observed that “some have argued that the duty to settle creates a blackmail dynamic, where 
insurers feel compelled to settle cases at limits, even when expected damages are below 
limits.”  See David A. Hyman, et. al, Settlement at Policy Limits and the Duty to Settle:  
Evidence from Texas, 8 J. Empir. Legal Stud. 48, 77 (2011). 
121 See generally Steven Shavell, Foundations of Economic Analysis of Law 258-59 
(2004). 22  PUNITIVE DAMAGES IN MASS TORT  [23-Jun-17 
of litigation.  However, the corporate managers who negotiate the settlement 
tend not to be highly diversified and thus are quite likely to be risk averse.122  
Mass tort plaintiffs are able to exploit risks of crushing punitive awards and 
managers’ risk averseness, extracting excessive, socially-wasteful blackmail 
settlements.123 
  The  accuracy  of  the  preceding  analysis  is  supported  by  similar 
analyses of analogous circumstances regarding liability insurers’ duties to 
settle tort claims within policy limits.  For decades a number of American 
courts have recognized a duty on the part of liability insurers to deal with 
offers to settle insured tort claims within policy limits as would a reasonable 
insurer on a policy without limits.124  Failure to settle reasonably brings 
excess liability without limits.  Absent such a liability rule, an insurer would 
have a lower incentive to respond reasonably to settlement offers within 
policy limits because the policy limits would reduce the settlement’s value to 
the insurer.125  With the duty-to-settle rule in place, in theory a reasonable, 
risk-neutral insurer would accept an offer to settle within policy limits only 
when the offer is at, or less than, the “true” (not policy-limits-constrained) 
expected value of the claim.126  The interesting question is whether the risk 
averseness of the insurer’s managers would lead them to pay blackmail, in 
such circumstances—i.e. would the threat of substantial in excess of policy 
limits liability cause them to pay more than the expected value of the claim?  
In theory, such a hypothesis seems plausible; empirical work on the problem 
is inconclusive, though it does not rule out such an effect.127  If one accepts 
                                                 
122 Id. 
123 Cf. supra note 120.  The tacit assumption here is that shareholders are unable 
adequately to monitor the behavior of managers.  See James A. Henderson, Jr., Products 
Liability and the Passage of Time:  The Imprisonment of Corporate Rationality, 58 N.Y.U. 
L. Rev. 765, 782 n.72 (1983). 
124 The seminal judicial decision is Crisci v. Security Insurance Co., 66 Cal. 2d 425, 426 
P.2d 173 (1967).  The leading law review articles are Robert Keeton, Liability Insurance and 
Responsibility for Settlement, 67 Harv. L. Rev. 1136 (1954); Kent D. Syverud, The Duty to 
Settle, 76 Va. L. Rev. 1113 (1990). 
125 For example, if the applicable policy limits were $100,000, the likely verdict were 
$150,000 and the probability of plaintiff winning were fifty percent, the expected value of 
the claim would be $75,000 (0.5 x $150,000).  If the plaintiff offered to settle for $70,000, 
an individual defendant without insurance should be willing to accept plaintiff’s offer.  
However, an insurance company under no duty to settle within policy limits would reject the 
offer, because the value of the claim to the insurer would be $50,000 (0.5 x $100,000). 
126 Under the liability rule, the insurer in note 125 would accept an offer of $70,000 
because it is lower than the $75,000 value of the claim.  The analysis here and in supra note 
125 ignores the role of transaction costs.  That consideration increases the value to insurers 
of any offer to settle, given that settlement always avoids the costs to both sides of continuing 
to pursue trials or appeals. 
127 See supra note 120, 8 J. Empirical Legal Stud. at 78.  The critical variable is the risk 
averseness of the managers who decide whether or not to accept offers to settle.  As a 23-Jun-17]  James A. Henderson, Jr.  23 
the analogy between the threat of significant excess liability for failure to 
settle within policy limits and the threat of significant punitive damages for 
failure  to  settle  mass  tort  claims,  then  the  evidence  suggests  that  jury 
capriciousness in the latter context tends to produce blackmail settlements 
that are, from a societal perspective, wastefully high. 
 
 
 
2.  Multiple Successive Awards for the Same Wrongful  
Conduct Are Unfair to Defendants 
 
  The task of triers of fact in a mass tort action involving punitive 
damages is to determine the appropriate punitives award, if any, in the case 
before them based on an assessment of the wrongfulness of the defendant’s 
conduct toward the broadly-defined category of persons of which the joined 
plaintiffs are members.128  Ordinarily nothing prevents persons who do not 
join as plaintiffs in earlier mass tort actions from subsequently bringing their 
own actions against the same defendants, perhaps in different jurisdictions.  
In the later actions, the triers of fact are not limited by punitive awards in the 
earlier action(s), and are free to arrive at newly-calculated awards based on 
the  same  evidence  and  reflecting  the  same  overall  assessment  of  the 
defendants’ wrongfulness as in previous actions.  And nothing necessarily 
prevents even further actions, punishing the defendants repetitively for the 
same wrongful conduct.  The likelihood of multiple, duplicative (and thus 
often  greatly  excessive  in  the  aggregate)  punishments  has  struck  both 
courts129 and scholars130 as grossly unfair. 
                                                 
counterbalancing consideration, shareholders of insurance companies might be more apt to 
monitor  managers  successfully  than  would  shareholders  of  other  types  of  business 
corporation.  Cf. supra note 123.

3.  Punitive Damages Awards Exact Greater Retribution From Actors  
Who Are Less Deserving of Punishment 
 
    Most of the defendants in mass tort actions are corporations, artificial 
entities with “no soul to damn; no body to kick.”131  Corporations typically 
pay  punitive  judgments  out  of  general  assets  owned  indirectly  by 
shareholders and liability insurance paid for on their behalf.132  Corporate 
structures shift both types of liability costs from the individual managers who 
make what are later judged to be the antisocial decisions to the corporation’s 
shareholders who, in a publicly-held corporation, almost certainly do not.133  
This  cost-shifting  may  not  make  much  practical  difference  from  the 
standpoint of deterrence since management, whom the market incentivizes to 
maximize their corporations’ profits, will presumably internalize the relevant 
costs in any event, thereby promoting allocative efficiency.  But shareholders 
of  publicly-held  corporations  do  not  deserve  moral  retribution  for  the 
wrongful  behavior  of  management  over  whom  shareholders  have  no 
meaningful  control.134    And  they  most  certainly  do  not  deserve  such 
retribution when they become shareholders only after the allegedly egregious 
corporate  behavior  has  occurred.135    Not  surprisingly  scholars  have 
concluded that the very idea of expressing moral outrage and righteous 
indignation toward a public corporation is manifestly unrealistic.136 It follows

officers, and managers harmless for decisions made on behalf of the corporation.  See 
Directors  and  Officers  Liability  Insurance, 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directors_and_officers_liability_insurance.    The  insurance 
premiums—or punitives judgments if there is inadequate insurance—are paid out of the 
corporation’s revenues and capital, and thus are borne by the shareholders or, if the 
corporation is bankrupt, the tort victims or the corporation’s creditors.  For a discussion of 
this and related corporate issues see generally A. Mitchell Polinsky and Steven Shavell, supra

teams are worthy of punishment,137 punitives do not serve, as do criminal 
convictions, to punish specific wrongdoers.138  Thus, as a form of moral 
retribution punitives in mass torts miss the mark. 
 
4.  Punitive Awards Fail to Vindicate Those Who  
Most Deserve Vindication 
 
  Scholars have pointed to the reality that, especially in connection with 
mass torts based on toxic exposures, a queuing problem arises in which great 
numbers  of  plaintiff-victims,  many  with  no  physical  injuries,  threaten 
defendants with bankruptcy.139  In those cases, one may assume that plaintiffs 
who get into court early, while corporate coffers are relatively full, tend to 
receive their judgments in full; whereas later-filing, often more seriously 
injured plaintiffs may receive pennies on the dollar, or nothing at all.140  Of 
course, this can happen even if punitive damages are not involved.141  But 
large punitive awards, when granted in actions that first reach court, can 
greatly exacerbate the problem.  To the extent that large punitive awards paid 
in early actions reduce the funds available to pay victims who file and settle 
later;142 and victims who are injured more severely tend to come to court 
later;143  punitive  awards  in  mass  tort  actions  tend  to  reduce  or  deny 
vindication of arguably more deserving victims.144

Crisis, 71 Miss. L. Rev. 1, 2 nn.6&7 and text accompanying. (2001) 
141 Large compensatory pay-outs may deplete a defendant’s resources without any help 
from punitive awards, especially if courts allow plaintiffs without personal injury to recover 
for elements such as increased risk, mental upset, and medical monitoring.  See supra notes 
58-61 and text accompanying. 
142 Certainly this is true when early filers are part of a class of plaintiffs seeking recovery 
for increased risk of illness and mental suffering.  See id. and accompanying text. 
143 See supra notes 56-59 and text accompanying.  Many of those who are exposed to 
asbestos fibers or other toxics can be expected to wait to file until they manifest symptoms 
of physical injury. 
144 For a plausible argument that plaintiffs who suffer no physical injury are no less 
deserving recipients of punitive damages, see David G. Owen, Against Priority, 37 Sw. U. 
L. Rev. 557 (2008). 26  PUNITIVE DAMAGES IN MASS TORT  [23-Jun-17 
5.  Punitive Damages Are Not Only Ineffective, 
They Are Not Really Necessary  
 
  The  preceding  subsections  describe  the  imperfect  mechanics  of 
delivering punitive awards in mass torts.  This subsection argues that, in 
addition to administrative problems blunting their effectiveness, punitive 
damages are not really necessary to achieve adequate deterrence.  Regarding 
general deterrence, recall that tort law achieves that objective by internalizing 
the costs of risky enterprises.145 To the extent that commercial enterprises 
bear their social costs, market demand for what they produce declines in 
proportion to risk and the world is a safer place.  Instrumentalists justify 
punitive damages as a gap-filling device that steps in when compensatory 
damages do not adequately cover all of plaintiffs’ losses,146 thereby helping 
to internalize the social costs of the relevant enterprises.  This justification 
for punitive damages is undermined to the extent that American courts are 
willing  to  allow  more  and  more  generous  compensatory  awards  for  a 
widening variety of intangible losses.147 One may reasonably assume that 
those more generous compensatory awards internalize a greater portion of an 
enterprise’s social costs, thus leaving less need for courts to award punitive 
damages  with  all  their  administrative  difficulties  and  accompanying 
unfairness, in order to achieve general deterrence. 
    Much the same things may be said of the effectiveness of, or need for, 
punitive damages to achieve specific deterrence.  Rather than aiming to 
internalize the social costs of risky enterprises, specific deterrence aims to 
discourage  enterprises  from  engaging  in  the  specific  types  of  wrongful 
behavior referenced in the relevant punitive damages triggers.  To accomplish 
this objective, the punitive damages triggers must be specific enough to 
provide fair notice to potential wrongdoers of what is expected by way of 
forbearance.  However, given the vagueness of many such triggers148 and the 
significant  lengths  of  time  between  defendant’s  conduct  and  entry  of 
judgment, one may doubt whether threats of future punitive awards actually 
affect industry behavior beyond maintaining a generalized terror regarding 
ruinous litigation.  Another specific-deterrence-related rationale for punitive 
awards rests on the assumption that many victims injured by wrongful 
conduct do not link defendants’ activities with their injuries.  For that reason 
                                                 
145 See supra note 24 and text accompanying. 
146 See supra note 22 and text accompanying. 
147 See supra notes 58-60 and text accompanying. 
148 See supra notes 8-11 and accompanying text.  See generally Anthony J. Franze and

133, 146 n.66 (1982). 23-Jun-17]  James A. Henderson, Jr.  27 
many victims never bring tort actions, thereby lowering the expected values 
of would-be defendants’ exposures to liability for compensatory damages.149  
Punitive damages in traditional one-on-one litigation presumably add to the 
values of these exposures, helping to bring levels of deterrence closer to the 
optimum.  The problem with this rationale in the present mass-tort context is 
that its factual premises are probably false, given that mass torts have an 
inherently high profile and the plaintiffs’ bar advertises extensively in ways 
that inform injured victims regarding the sources of their injuries.150 
From a broader perspective, punitive damages may not be necessary to 
achieve specific deterrence in mass torts, given that most of the corporate 
enterprises against whom plaintiffs bring mass tort actions are subject to 
nonjudicial  governmental  safety  regulations,  specifically  formulated  and 
backed by criminal sanctions.151  Given these regimes of regulation, it seems 
unlikely that vague threats of future punitive damages awards serve any 
useful purpose as a supplemental source of specific deterrence. 
  
B.  Possible Solutions to the Problems of Awarding Punitive Damages  
in Mass Torts 
 
1.  Marginal Changes in the Rules Might Accomplish, at Most,  
Modest Improvements 
 
  A number of possible solutions to the above-described problems are 
worth considering.152  Capriciousness in the awarding of punitive damages 
might  be  reduced  by  replacing  vague  triggers  such  as  “indifference,” 
“disregard,”  and  “willfulness”153  with  either  more  qualitatively  specific 
                                                 
149 Defendants may intentionally help to create this circumstance.  See supra note 24 and

153 See supra notes 8 & 11 and text accompanying. 28  PUNITIVE DAMAGES IN MASS TORT  [23-Jun-17 
triggers  such  as  “criminally  dangerous  conduct  intended  to  cause  great 
harm”154 or more quantitatively extreme triggers such as “opprobrious” and 
“heinous.”155  And judges might either replace juries in deciding whether 
punitives are warranted and in what amounts, or review jury verdicts more 
strictly in those regards.156  Raising the burden of persuasion also might help 
to reduce jury capriciousness.157 A combination of these marginal changes 
might to some extent reduce the capriciousness of punitive damages awards.  
Marginal solutions to the problem of multiple punitive awards for the same 
conduct are equally difficult.  Reductions in unfair redundancy might be 
achieved by limiting punitives in any given action to some modest multiple 
of the compensatory damages awarded or preventing mass tort plaintiffs from 
introducing evidence of harm caused by defendant’s conduct to persons not 
joined as plaintiffs in the case before the court.158   
The problems associated with the ineffectiveness of punitive damages 
in achieving general or specific deterrence in mass torts defy solution by 
means of marginal adjustments.  This is where the clash of basic philosophies 
is most telling.  At heart, deterrence is an instrumental, efficiency-oriented 
concept.159    Because  mass  tort  actions  ostensibly  serve  efficiency 
objectives,160 it is appropriate that deterrence should be an objective of such 
actions.  By contrast, in the opinion of a majority of experts, punitive damages 
reflect mostly noninstrumental, fairness values.161  It follows that purporting 
to punish wrongdoing has nothing logically to do with achieving efficiency 
objectives except to confuse matters.  No marginal law reform will alter such 
a fundamental inconsistency in objectives. 
                                                 
154 No jurisdiction employs this hypothetical trigger. 
155 Cf. supra notes 12-14 and text accompanying.  Note that the earlier-referenced 
concepts are scholars’ characterizations rather than judicially-implemented triggers. 
156 Replacing juries with judges might run into difficulties with right-to-jury-trial 
provisions in federal and state constitutions.  See generally Fleming James, Jr., Right to a 
Jury Trial in Civil Actions, 72 Yale. L. Rev. 655 (1963).  And one may question the 
effectiveness of judicial attempts to second-guess jury awards.  See supra note 116 and text 
accompanying. 
157 Many states already raise the burden.  See generally Richard L. Blatt, Punitive 
Damages: A State by State Guide to Law and Practice 000 (1991) (Supp. 0000).  An 
argument may be made that these sorts of adjustments do not actually affect decisionmaking 
by triers of fact.  See generally James A. Henderson, Jr., Contract’s Constitutive Core: 
Solving Problems by Making Deals, U. Ill. L. Rev. 89, 130 n.224 and text accompanying 
(2012). 
158  Interestingly,  the  U.S.  Supreme  Court  has  incorporated  both  of  these  latter 
modifications of existing law as important elements in its efforts to limit punitive awards on 
due process grounds.  For a collection of materials describing these developments see supra 
note 12, James A. Henderson, Jr. et. al. at 651-62.

161 See supra note 30 and text accompanying. 23-Jun-17]  James A. Henderson, Jr.  29 
The problem with punitive awards advantaging mass tort plaintiffs 
who file early remains to be considered.162  One possible solution might be 
for trial courts to split their dockets in asbestos and other toxics litigation and 
send  to  deferral  registries  those  plaintiffs  who,  although  exposed  to 
defendants’ asbestos-containing products, have not yet manifested physical 
injuries resulting from such exposure.163  Deferral registries cover mass torts 
more  broadly  than  merely  those  that  award  punitives;  but  punitives 
exacerbate the problem they address.164  Many courts have implemented 
these proposals.165  In these split-docket arrangements, the main tort action 
proceeds, often on an accelerated, expedited basis.166  Claims assigned to the 
deferral registry hang in limbo, awaiting such time that the plaintiffs manifest 
asbestos-related physical injury.  When and if this occurs, courts return the 
deferred claims back to the active docket and they proceed to trial.  Judges 
who have worked with these deferral registries have commended them as 
effective docket-clearing mechanisms.167  At least one leading academic has 
criticized deferral registries on fairness grounds.168  An alternative solution 
might be for courts to allow separate actions for punitives, prosecuted in 
parallel with the underlying mass tort actions for compensatory damages and 
managed by the trial judge.  The proceeds of the punitive damages actions 
held in trust for the benefit of those who join the mass tort actions regardless 
of when they happen to file.169  A number of scholars have suggested 
variations on this solution.170

awards are not uncommon.  See generally Theodore Eisenberg & Martin T. Wells, The

2.  The Only Effective, Principled Solution Would Be to Eliminate Punitive 
Damages from All Forms of Mass Tort 
 
a.  The Substantive Merits 
 
  As  indicated,  the  administrative  problems  that  result  in  jury 
capriciousness  might  be  reduced  somewhat  by  marginal  adjustments.171  
However, multiple awards in successive mass tort actions are bound to persist 
in the absence of a central authority empowered to coordinate otherwise 
independent recoveries.172  And as observed earlier, punitive damages awards 
are not required in order for mass torts to accomplish adequate general 
deterrence173  and  are  unlikely  to  accomplish  specific  deterrence.174  
Moreover, the retributive potential of punitive awards is questionable, given 
that such awards frequently punish the wrong actors and vindicate the wrong 
victims.175  It follows that the only effective solution to these problems would 
be for state courts and legislatures to eliminate punitive damages altogether 
in mass torts.  A number of respected tort scholars, especially those who 
approach tort law from a fairness perspective, doubt that punitive damages 
belong in mass tort actions.176     
  Scholars who endorse punitive awards in mass torts tend to view tort 
law’s primary goal to be the efficient allocation of resources.177  For these 
writers, embracing the concept of punishment as an appropriate end in itself 
reflects fuzzy, circular thinking.178  From the efficiency perspective, punitive 
damages in mass torts are mainly a means of achieving general deterrence via 
cost internalization.179  As noted earlier, efficiency scholars justify punitive 
                                                 
171 See supra notes 152-170 and text accompanying. 
172 See Gary T. Schwartz, supra note 130 at 431 (“[T]ort law should certainly seek to 
avoid the result of inflicting inappropriate multiple punishments. . . . [Critics] have . . . 
suggested that the solution must be decided at the national level.  [However,] [n]o single 
state—let alone a single state court—can develop and carry out a meaningful solution.”) 
173 See supra text accompanying notes 145-147.

176 See supra note 3 and accompanying text.

Analysis, 111 Harv. L. Rev. 869 (1998).   
178 Id. at 949, 955.  Likening the fairness-based retribution rationale to condoning the 
punishment of trees that fall on people, the authors leave their readers to decide whether the 
fairness rationale makes sense, clearly implying that it does not.  See also Richard A. Posner, 
Killing or Wounding to Protect a Property Interest, 14 J. L. & Econ. 201, 225 (1971)

damages on the ground that punitives help to compensate plaintiffs for 
elements of loss, such as attorneys’ fees, not recoverable under American 
law.180    By  internalizing  such  costs,  punitive  awards  help  to  achieve 
allocative efficiency.  From the fairness perspective, economists who endorse 
a cost-internalization rationale for punitives are not only ignoring a major 
rationale for imposing liability, but they are oblivious to the plain meaning of 
law’s language.181 
 
b.  Overturning Precedents 
   
  It remains to consider a further plausible argument for retaining 
punitive damages awards in mass torts: adherence to precedent.  After all, 
even regarding legislation, constancy deserves respect.182  And regarding 
court-made  change  in  the  law,  the  rule  of  stare  decisis  formalizes  the 
commitment to constancy.183  But even that general rule admits of exceptions 
based on preserving institutional integrity.184  Thus, whenever an appellate 
court decides whether to overturn a precedent that the court believes either to 
have been wrongly decided or to have outworn its welcome, two institutional 
considerations should be brought to bear: first, whether the existing rule is 
encountering  administrative/mechanical  difficulties  that  are  producing 
inconsistent, capricious outcomes;185 and second, whether overturning the 
                                                 
180 Fairness-oriented scholars might respond by arguing that if cost-internalization were 
a primary objective served by punitives awards, one would not only expect the law governing 
compensatory damages to allow for attorney’s fees, but also would not expect cost-
internalization to be served by proof of egregiously wrongful behavior.  See supra notes 22-
23 and text accompanying. 
181 As one leading author observes in support of the noninstrumental concepts of 
retribution and desert: 
     
  “I . . . propose that we be willing to take ‘punitive’ damages at face 
value—that is, as primarily designed to punish.  This understanding has 
the initial advantage of taking language seriously—of recognizing that our 
law’s language intends to express meaning.”

existing rule would detrimentally affect either the reliance-based interests of 
the parties typically involved in its application or the judicial system’s 
reputation for apolitical integrity. 186 
  Both of these considerations support breaking with precedent and 
proscribing punitive damages in all mass tort actions.  As for the first 
consideration of administrative unworkability, the existing rules allowing 
punitive damages awards in traditional mass torts are clearly in serious 
trouble on a variety of fronts.  If the observations made earlier leave doubts 
regarding the administrative/mechanical problems and the proposed marginal 
solutions,187 one need look no further than the Supreme Court’s current due-
process efforts at reform for clear indications that state laws governing 
punitive damages are seriously in need of change.188  Regarding the second 
consideration relating to reliance interests of the parties, the only repeat 
players who could plausibly be said to have reliance-based expectations of 
continuing to receive the benefits from punitive awards in mass torts are 
members of the plaintiffs’ bar.189  But plaintiffs’ lawyers’ expectations, in the 
absence  of  significant  changes  in  their  position  in  reliance  on  those 
expectations, do not constitute the type of detrimental reliance that might 
justify retention of an unworkable status quo.190   
  The consideration relating to the judiciary’s continued appearance of 
legitimacy supports overruling precedent in this instance, given that doing so 
would  eliminate  manifestly  unpredictable,  inconsistent,  and  self-
contradictory  aspects  of  awarding  punitive  damages  in  mass  torts.191  
Overruling in this instance would appear to reasonable observers to be 
necessary in order to repair a broken aspect of mass tort.  Quite simply, 
punitive damages awards in mass torts are not only substantively wrong but 
                                                 
186 See id at text accompanying notes 36-60, relying on Planned Parenthood of S.E. 
Pennsylvania v Casey, 505 U.S. 833 (1992).  See generally Randy J. Kozel, Precedent and 
Reliance, 62 Emory L.J. 1459 (2013). 
187 See supra notes 109-170 and text accompanying. 
188 See supra note 158. 
189 Plaintiffs, themselves, are not repeat players and therefore have no cognizable 
expectations prior to the commencement of their tort action.  Courts do not recognize rights 
of the parties to have applicable law frozen as of the filing of a complaint.  See generally 
Beryl Harold Levy, Realist Jurisprudence and Prospective Overruling, 109 U. Pa. L. Rev. 1 
(1960) (seminal article approving prospective overruling). 
190 By allowing punitive damages historically, the tort system may be seen to impliedly 
promise to repeat players such as members of the plaintiffs’ bar, to continue to do so.  
However, plaintiffs’ lawyers do not materially change their positions in reliance on this 
implicit promise, and therefore do not rely to their detriment in the sense required for the 
equivalent of estoppel to occur.  Cf. Jones v. Wachovia Bank, 230 Cal. App. 4th 935 (2014) 
(no promissory estoppel without change of position.) 
191 See supra, text accompanying notes 111-144. 23-Jun-17]  James A. Henderson, Jr.  33 
also transparently anachronistic and unworkable.  Precedents allowing such 
awards deserve to be overruled. 
 
III.   PUNITIVE DAMAGES ARE MANIFESTLY INAPPROPRIATE  IN EMERGING, 
NONTRADITIONAL FORMS OF MASS TORT 
 
This Part III assumes for argument’s sake that courts will endorse 
some, at least, of the emerging forms of mass tort herein referenced and that 
some of them will continue to expand into the foreseeable future.192  The 
analysis that follows argues that punitive awards should not be part of these 
emerging expansions of mass tort.  This conclusion should not imply that 
punitive damages are appropriate in traditional mass torts.  It simply reflects 
the reality that, in connection with nontraditional mass torts, the case against 
punitives is much stronger and that stare decisis presents less of a problem. 
 
A.  The Administrative Problems Regarding Punitives Are Exacerbated in 
the Context of Emerging Forms of Mass Tort 
 
  If Part II of this Article makes a persuasive case that punitive damages 
awards have no proper place in traditional mass torts, then beyond question 
punitives  have  no  place  in  connection  with  the  subset  of  emerging, 
nontraditional forms of mass tort.  Courts in these emerging forms encounter 
all of the problems identified in preceding discussions.  Indeed, a number of 
the problems are likely to worsen when courts strip traditional elements of 
fault from the underlying doctrine and mass tort actions evolve into vehicles 
for  achieving  strict  enterprise  liability.    In  general,  the  inherently  self-
contradictory mix of fairness-based punishment and efficiency-based strict 
enterprise liability will survive marginal reform efforts and will continue to 
confuse  triers  of  fact.193    Indeed,  capriciousness  in  trial  outcomes  may 
increase as a result of such confusion.  Moreover, as these nontraditional mass 
torts more and more transparently come to resemble industry-wide enterprise 
liability,  adding  potentially  crushing  punitive  awards  will  increase 
opportunities for plaintiffs to prosecute so-called settlement class actions, 
exacting huge sums from defendants seemingly in exchange for terminating 
the rights of underrepresented future claimants for pennies on the dollar.194 
  Another  problem  generated  by  punitive  awards  in  emerging,

Essay in Oxymoron, 39 Vill. L. Rev. 505, 508 (1994) (“For those who would keep [the basis 
of liability] strict, the presence of any fault concepts [such as punitive damages] would be 
anathema.”)

specific deterrence, as a general rule the threat of future liability should create 
incentives for wrongdoers to avoid behaving badly.  For such behavioral 
modification  to  occur  the  wrongdoers  must  be  given  advance  warning 
regarding what to expect.  So long as liability for punitive damages rests on 
notions of truly egregious wrong-doing, actors can modify their conduct 
accordingly.  However, once courts eliminate fault from these emerging 
forms of mass tort, members of lawful, not-yet-targeted industries can only 
guess when, if ever, their turn at the public whipping post, including the 
potentially deadly sting of punitive damages, will arrive. 
  This  problem  of  lack  of  adequate  forewarning  is  illustrated  by 
peripheral defendants in asbestos litigation.195  Twenty-five years ago it is 
doubtful that sellers of non-asbestos-containing workplace machinery could 
reasonably have foreseen that they would one day be liable for harms caused 
by asbestos-containing products manufactured by others and combined post-
sale with the seller’s asbestos-free machinery.  But even if they are properly 
charged with foreseeing liability for compensatories based on these new 
versions of strict enterprise liability,196 could they, have anticipated the threat 
of potentially crushing punitive damages awards for being members of an 
industry whose products are combined post-sale with asbestos-containing 
products?   
  Projecting beyond peripheral defendants in asbestos litigation, it is 
anyone’s guess which large industry will be the next target of nontraditional 
forms of mass tort.  Should portions of the sports equipment industry begin 
to prepare for an onslaught of claims, including claims for punitive damages, 
on behalf of the hundreds of thousands of persons injured each year while 
engaging in healthful and enjoyable, but inherently risky, sports activities?197  
Will members of the petroleum industry find themselves in strictly liable for 
having distributed gasoline that enables and encourages inherently dangerous 
motor  vehicle  travel?198    In  these  somewhat  farfetched  hypothetical 
examples, the ostensible doctrinal bases of liability would be stretched-thin 
                                                 
195 See supra note 54 and text accompanying. 
196 Tort law is always evolving and changing and actors arguably should be required, 
within reason, to anticipate such changes. 
197 That this is not a totally far-fetched possibility is borne out by plaintiffs’ effort to 
impose category liability on inherently dangerous sports equipment such as trampolines.  See 
supra note 105 and text accompanying. 
198 If one envisions the gasoline distributors as attracting motor vehicle operators to harm 
one  another,  such  a  theory  would  resemble  the  imposition  of  liability  on  peripheral 
defendants who distribute machines that attract asbestos-containing gaskets.  See supra notes 
54-57 and text accompanying.  See also note 95 and text accompanying (actions to hold 
weapons manufacturers liable for gun-related criminal behavior). 23-Jun-17]  James A. Henderson, Jr.  35 
variations of failure-to-warn, public nuisance, and the like.199  But the true 
objective of such new forms of mass tort, should they arise, will be the 
imposition of a potentially crushing risk tax on lawful industries that, while 
unavoidably contributing to causing harm to some persons, deliver significant 
benefits to many others.  Once again, the question here is not whether courts 
should recognize such theories of strict enterprise liability, but whether courts 
should make punitive damages part of the mass torts used to implement those 
theories. 
 
B.   From a Substantive Perspective, Awarding Punitive Damages in 
Nontraditional Forms of Mass Tort Would Be An  
Exercise in Disheartening Cynicism 
 
  As preceding discussions make clear, a near-total disconnect exists 
between the true rationale underlying the new mass torts—strict enterprise 
liability based on the lawful, nonnegligent creation of risk—and the major 
rationale underlying punitive damages—punishing egregious wrongdoing.  
To be sure, an individual industry member may act badly and be deserving 
of punishment.  But the ostensible basis of these punitive awards will not be 
idiosyncratic wrongdoing by a few, but the willingness of all defendants to 
participate in the targeted industry while knowing of the generic risks to 
customers and bystanders.  Were courts to invoke the rhetoric of punishing 
wrongdoing to impose the functional equivalents of no-fault risk taxes on 
socially suspect industries, they would clearly be engaging in exercises of 
disheartening cynicism.200 
 
C.   Proscription of Punitive Damages in Nontraditional Mass Torts  
Would Not Require Much Overturning of Precedent 
 
  Recall that a broad proscription of punitive damages in traditional 
mass torts would require courts to overturn precedent.201  Because emerging 
forms of mass tort are works-in-progress, they present an easier task in this 
regard.  Thus, if courts become convinced that punitive damages should not 
be allowed in these emerging, nontraditional forms of mass tort, presumably 
they will be able to distinguish their earlier decisions allowing punitives in 
                                                 
199 Cf. supra note 40 and text accompanying.

means toward the end of finding defendants with whom to fund asbestos litigation in 
perpetuity, see Victor E. Schwartz and Mark A. Behrens, Asbestos Litigation:  The “Endless 
Search for a Solvent Bystander,” 23 Widener L.J. 59 (2013).  See also supra note 86 for a 
plaintiffs’ lawyer’s cynical observation in the context of lead pigment abatement.

overturned.202  But that need not occur in this context. 
 
CONCLUSION 
 
  Punitive damages have no proper place in mass torts.  No hard data 
are available showing that punitives awards in mass tortsachieve deterrence 
objectives effectively, and common sense strongly suggests they do not.  Nor 
are punitives needed in those contexts.  Expansions in the rules governing 
compensatory damages have enhanced general deterrence to the point that 
punitive damages are not justified on that ground.  And nonjudicial safety 
regulations, backed by  criminal sanctions, presumably provide  adequate 
specific deterrence with regard to most of the commercial activities involved 
in mass torts.  Of course, even if punitive damages in mass torts are not 
warranted instrumentally on the basis of achieving deterrence, one might try 
to justify them noninstrumentally in terms of punishing wrongdoers and 
vindicating their victims.  Although some legal scholars believe that such 
symbolic  gestures  are  worth  making  for  their  own  sakes,  upon  closer 
examination reasonable minds must conclude that punitive awards in mass 
torts accomplish retribution and vindication at best clumsily and often quite 
unfairly.  Moreover, in addition to these serious shortcomings, juries award 
punitive damages so capriciously that the threat of crushing liability places 
extraordinary power in the hands of plaintiffs to extort blackmail settlements 
that primarily serve not the public welfare, but the lawyers’ own.  Punitive 
damages, which have an ancient lineage, may make more sense in classic 
one-on-one tort litigation.  However, in the context of mass tort actions they 
make no sense at all, generating significant social costs that far exceed their 
benefits. 
Legislatures  might  eliminate  punitive  awards  in  mass  torts  if  the 
anticipated political opposition from the plaintiffs’ bar could be overcome.  
Presumably courts are not so directly influenced by politics, but for them to 
proscribe punitive damages in all mass tort actions, including traditional mass 
torts, in many states they would be required to overrule a half-century or more 
of precedents.  The general rule of stare decisis, admonishing courts to follow 
precedents, is subject to exceptions based on institutional criteria independent 
of the substantive merits.  Regarding punitive awards in traditional mass torts, 
these criteria are clearly satisfied.  Because punitive awards in mass torts are 
manifestly unworkable and grossly unfair, courts are justified in overturning 
precedents  allowing  such  awards.    Regarding  punitive  damages  in 
nontraditional mass torts—attempts at social engineering aiming to impose

strict enterprise liability on entire industries—no long-standing precedents 
exist that courts need to overrule.  It follows that even if some courts were 
misguidedly to balk at overruling precedents in traditional, fault-based mass 
torts,  they  should  not  feel  similarly  constrained  in  the  context  of 
nontraditional, strict-liability-based forms of mass tort where, in the absence 
of precedents that might otherwise require overruling, they are free to do the 
right thing.
