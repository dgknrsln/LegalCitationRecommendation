Political Accountability in a System of
Checks  and  Balances: The  Case  of
Presidential  Review  of Rulemaking
Peter M. Shane*
We  are  living  through  a  period  of intense  debate-
among  both academics  and politicians-regarding  the  ap-
propriate  presidential role in supervising  our vast national
bureaucracy.  That debate  has two distinct, if overlapping,
dimensions.  One is  constitutional:  does  the  Constitution,
read historically or otherwise, command a particular model
of presidential  supervision?'  The  second  addresses  ques-
tions  of policy:  does  government  function  best  when  the
President  enjoys  plenary  authority  over  the  entire  policy
output of the bureaucracy?2  Or is government more effec-
tive  when  policy  making influence  is shared  between  the
President and Congress, and among high-level bureaucratic
administrators?
The  Reagan  and  Bush  Administrations  took  explicit
positions on both sets of issues.  On the doctrinal side, the
Meese Justice Department expressly promulgated a system-
atic  creed  of constitutional  interpretation.3   This  Reagan-

dictates that the President  have plenary control over all officials  who help imple-
ment the laws.  Steven  G. Calabresi, Some Normative Arguments for the Unitary
Executive, 48 ARK. L. REV. 23 (1995).  By way of contrast, Professors Larry Lessig
and Cass Sunstein argue that, as an originalist matter, the Constitution authorized
Congress "to limit the exercise of administrative powers as a condition to its grant of
these powers to any officer of the government."  Lawrence Lessig & Cass R. Sun-
stein, The President and the Administration, 94 COLUM. L. REV. 1, 54 (1994).
2.  Despite their view that the Constitution did not originally command strong
Presidential control over all administration, Professors  Lessig and Sunstein would
answer this particular question in the affirmative-and reinterpret the Constitution
in light of that conclusion.  Lessig & Sunstein, supra note 1, at 93-106.

Bush  (RB)  legal  dogma  included  what  I  have  elsewhere
called  a "categorical"  theory of the separation  of powers.4
The theory asserted that, with a few explicit exceptions, the
Constitution contemplates  a stark compartmentalization  of
government  powers  as  legislative,  executive,  or  judicial;
once  a  power  is  found to  be executive,  neither  Congress,
nor court may limit  it.  Under the  RB view,  not only was
"executive"  power deemed legally impregnable, but an ex-
traordinary amount of policy making power was argued to
be "executive."'5 The RB position held that, as a matter of
constitutional dictate, the President enjoys plenary author-
ity over all policy making  involved in the execution of the
laws.6
On the policy side, the Reagan and Bush Administra-
tions' redesign of executive branch mechanisms for the cen-
tralized  review  of regulatory  policy  was wholly  consistent
with their separation of powers views.  Initial steps taken by
the first  Reagan  Administration  could have  been seen  as
relatively  incremental  innovations  in  what  retrospectively
appears to be a fairly modest management system that had
evolved in linear fashion from the Nixon through the Carter
Administrations.7  But the trend toward hierarchy and con-
fidentiality  intensified  progressively  in  the  late  1980s.  It
reached an apotheosis with the activities of the now-defunct
President's Council on Competitiveness, headed during the
Bush Administration  by Vice-President  Dan Quayle.8  The
Council  vigorously  advocated  a  theory  of  the  executive

branch in which the President's policy roles, even in domes-
tic affairs, are broadly discretionary, dischargeable in secret,
relatively  immune to congressional  scrutiny  (at least as  to
process),  and  subject  to  judicial  review  only  in  rare
instances.
The  Clinton  Administration's  stances  are  less  clear.
On  one  hand,  the  Clinton  Administration  has  witnessed
some of the traditionally bold lawyering for broad presiden-
tial authority that one expects from virtually any Adminis-
tration.9  On the other hand, President Clinton's revamp of
presidential  regulatory  oversight  has,  in  some  significant
ways, stepped back from categorical separationism.  Execu-
tive Order No. 12,866,10 President Clinton's successor to the
RB oversight system, pays significant deference  to a theory
of separation  of powers more attentive  to checks  and bal-
ances-to  the  ideas,  in  particular,  that  Congress  is  first
among  co-equals  in  domestic  policy  making  and  that  the
Founders expected the three branches of our national gov-
ernment to hold one another to account.11  President  Clin-
ton  has  also  embraced,  in  two  conspicuous  contexts,  the
wisdom of relative  bureaucratic  independence  from  presi-
dential  influence.  He supported reauthorization  of the in-
dependent counsel provisions of the Ethics in Government
Act,12 and he has urged the reorganization  of the Social Se-
curity Administration  as an independent  agency.'3

The RB categorical version of separation  of powers is
weakly rooted in the history of the Constitution on which it
purports to be based, and, therefore, for rigorous constitu-
tional originalists, it is not likely to be persuasive as a read-
ing  of  constitutional  command.14   Moreover,  as  I  have
argued  elsewhere,  it is a vision  that seriously risks  under-
mining a "rule of law" ethos in the internal conduct of exec-
utive branch affairs.15  Therefore,  those inclined to read the
Constitution  in  a  less  historicized,  more  values-oriented
way need to consider seriously whether categorical separa-
tionism can be squared with the Constitution's obvious alle-
giance  to "rule of law" values.
Categorical  separationism  has been  touted, however,
as  having  another particular  virtue-a virtue  exemplified,
according  to its proponents,  by the  RB  regulatory review
system  it  helped sustain.  That virtue is the  promotion  of
political  accountability.' 6  The purpose  of this  article is to
examine that claim in light of the competing RB and Clin-
ton models of presidential  regulatory  oversight.  My thesis
is that the Clinton model of regulatory oversight, if imple-
mented  in the  spirit that animates  the prose  of Executive
Order No. 12,866, promises a significant gain in political ac-
countability.  In essence, its promised diffusion of authority
would not weaken accountability,  but strengthen it.  To see
why that is so requires a brief comparison of the two mod-
els  and reflection on  actual  experience  under  the  Council
on  Competitiveness.  But it  also necessitates  some discus-
sion of the very concept of "political accountability"  that is

I.  CATEGORICAL  SEPARATIONISM  AT WORK:
PRESIDENT  BUSH'S COUNCIL ON
COMPETITIVENESS
In analyzing separation of powers issues, it is important
to recall that there is no practical requirement that govern-
ment institutions fully implement whatever theories of gov-
ernment  are  privately  favored  by  those  in  control.
Congress  members may be  persuaded  of their near-exclu-
sive  authority  to  establish  domestic  economic  policy, yet
generously vest authority in administrators to perform that
very function.  The President, in turn, may share informa-
tion  freely  concerning  his  policy  deliberations  despite  a
principled conviction that he is  privileged  to withhold it17.
In regulatory oversight, however, the Bush Administration
did practice what it preached.  It purveyed  an official  con-
stitutional doctrine of plenary presidential authority to con-
trol bureaucratic activity, and, to an unprecedented degree,
it centralized regulatory  oversight in the White House.
The institution that ultimately spearheaded centralized
oversight  under  the  Bush  Administration  was  the  Presi-
dent's Council on Competitiveness.18  In June 1990,19 Presi-
dent Bush  assigned to that Council, by memorandum,  the
tasks of regulatory oversight  formerly  vested by President
Reagan  in  a  "Task  Force  on  Regulatory  Relief.''20   The
Council seemingly  perceived its role not merely as one of

reacting  to  agency  proposals  for  regulation.  The Council
also took the initiative in identifying controversial  areas of
regulatory  activity  on  which  to  focus  its  sustained
attention.2'
No  executive  order  or  other  formal  document
"chartered"  the Council on Competitiveness.  The sole pub-
lic document  marking its establishment and structure was a
"Fact  Sheet"  released  in April  1989,  by the  Office  of the
Vice-President.22 There is no indication that, while in oper-
ation,  the  Council followed  regular procedures,  published
or otherwise.  It had no formal or informal agreement with
Congress over legislative access to the documentation  of its
deliberative  contributions.23  It  established  no  controls  on
the degree or nature of its substantive contacts with outside
interests2. 4  The Council functioned  chiefly  not through its
members-all  presidential  advisers,  cabinet  members,  or
designated  representatives  from  particular  agencies-but
through the personal staff of the Vice-President.25 By inter-
agency  memo, it asserted its jurisdiction over:
not only regulations  that  are published  for notice  and
comment, but also strategy statements, guidelines, pol-
icy manuals,  grant and loan procedures,  Advance  No-
tices of Proposed Rulemaking, press releases and other
documents announcing or implementing regulatory pol-
icy that affects the public.26
Given the Council's limited resources, the percentage of ac-
tual  activities  the  Council  could  review  was  presumably
quite small compared to the entire regulatory output of the

federal executive.  Nonetheless, according to the Vice-Pres-
ident's self-expressed mandate, there was virtually no policy
making  activity that the  Council regarded  as categorically
beyond its reach.27
A  number  of  political  circumstances  coalesced  be-
tween 1990 and 1992 to give the Council special policy mak-
ing  prominence.  First,  contrary  to  President  Bush's
deregulatory  rhetoric,28  the  Bush  Administration  entered
1990 and 1991  with a record of significant  increases in the
number of new regulations being issued.29  Given the sensi-
tivity of that activity to  the business  community, plus  the
Vice-President's  widely  acknowledged  need for  enhanced
political  credibility,  the  Council  provided  the  Vice-Presi-
dent a significant forum through  which to demonstrate  his
substantiveness  and his clout. 30
Second, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)
regulatory review process got caught in a crossfire over the
1989  reauthorization  of  the  Paperwork  Reduction  Act.31
That statute authorized the Office of Information and Reg-
ulatory  Affairs  (OIRA),  which  dominhted  the  regulatory
review  effort  under  the  Reagan  Administrations  and
through  the first half of the Bush Administration.32  With
the statutory authorization for funding OIRA set to expire,
critics sought to insert into the reauthorization  bill a set of
procedural  constraints for OIRA regulatory review.  These
included  comprehensive  "logging"  requirements  for  all

OMB activities and communications  relating to review, the
imposition of deadlines  for the conduct  of reviews,  and a
requirement for OMB to explain in writing its reasons  for
suggesting  changes  in  any  proposed  regulation.  When
OMB threatened to recommend a veto of any such require-
ments, Richard  Darman, the  director  of OMB,  and Rep.
John Conyers, Chair of the House Government Operations
Committee,  reached  a  "sidebar"  agreement  to delete  the
statutory requirements  in return  for  an  OMB promise  to
implement  the  proposed  changes  administratively.33
Although the Darman-Conyers  pact appeared  to clear the
path for House support of reauthorization, the Administra-
tion informed  Rep.  Conyers that it could  not support the
Darman deal because its provisions "would seriously inter-
fere with the president's constitutional duty to supervise the
Executive Branch. '34
In retaliation, the Democratic  Congress refused either
to reauthorize OIRA or to confirm a presidential appointee
to succeed Wendy Gramm, who had departed as OIRA Ad-
ministrator in  1989.  As a  consequence,  OIRA  lacked  an
advice-and-consent appointee to wield its authority over ex-
ecutive agencies.  Although OIRA continued to operate its
regulatory  review  operation  without  an  express  statutory
charter, the Council  on Competitiveness  stepped in to fill
the political void and to set the tone of regulatory review in
a way that OIRA could not.35
Outside  commentators  have  credited  Allan  B.  Hub-
bard, the Council's executive director, with significantly in-
stitutionalizing the Council's regulatory review operation.36

environmental regulations that occupied most of the Coun-
cil's agenda.37   .I
There  is no  doubt the  Council had significant  impact
on the content of regulatory policy making.  As summarized
by one recent commentator, the Council "convinced agency
heads to weaken,  and in some cases eliminate,  regulations
relating to commercial  aircraft noise, the protection of wet-
lands, mandatory  recycling, and air pollution. 38
Its impact is well illustrated by the Environmental Pro-
tection  Agency's  (EPA)  experience  in issuing  regulations
under the Clean Air Act Amendments  of 1990 to limit the
effect of new municipal incinerators as sources of air pollu-
tion.  Among other things, the EPA originally proposed to:
require[]  operators  of [such]  new sources of air pollu-
tion  to  achieve  a  twenty-five  per  cent  reduction  by
weight of unprocessed waste by separating out some or
all of the following recoverable/recyclable materials: pa-
per and paperboard combined;  ferrous materials;  non-
ferrous metals;  glass; plastics;  household batteries; and
yard waste.39
EPA would further have required  the recycling of all lead-
acid batteries-the source of 60 percent of the lead in U.S.
garbage40-and  prohibited  their incineration  by municipal
incinerators.41  These  proposals were  based  on three cost-
benefit studies with which the Council on Competitiveness
42
disagreed.

The  Council  persuaded  EPA  to  change  the  agency's
view regarding the merits of the waste separation proposal.
EPA  abandoned its waste separation  requirement because
of its revised conclusion  that "emissions reductions  result-
ing  from  materials  separation  were  not  only  difficult  to
quantify but were in fact relatively  small. '43  The D.C. Cir-
cuit subsequently determined  that EPA had sufficient sup-
port  in  the  record  to  justify  this  change  in  view  as
nonarbitrary 4
As paraphrased  by the D.C. Circuit, the  Council also
had  argued  to  EPA  that  EPA's  waste  separation  plan
"would violate principles of federalism because waste man-
agement  is  traditionally  a  state  and  local  concern,"  and
would  not impose  a "standard  of performance"  as author-
ized by the  Clean Air Act, because the  rule would  set "a
strict standard rather than allowing flexibility in meeting a
particular  goal. '45  The D.C. Circuit did not rule  on these
arguments  because  EPA  did  not  rest  its  final  rule  upon
46
them.
The D.C. Circuit did, however, invalidate  EPA's deci-
sion not to ban the incineration of lead acid batteries.  Pub-
lic records  are not available  to substantiate  how  much  of
EPA's rationale for retreat emanated from the Council, but
it is reasonable, given the political context, to infer a  close
relationship  between  the thinking  of the  Council and  the
rethinking by EPA.  As recounted by the D.C. Circuit:
The  Agency  offered  three  reasons  for its  decision  to
omit  the  ban:  (1) commenters  questioned  whether  it
would  be possible  to achieve  100 percent compliance;
(2) the  Resource  Conservation  and Recovery  Act in-
cludes strict provisions against the burning of lead-acid
batteries;  and (3) EPA is considering a comprehensive
approach to recycling lead-acid batteries  under section
6 of the Toxic Substances Control Act.47
As the Court concluded, EPA's first reason utterly failed to
explain abandoning  a 100%  ban for no limit at all, and its

further reasons  offered no rationale  for failing to fulfill an
express Clean Air Act mandate to regulate new sources of
air pollution. 8
Among the Council's other most controversial deregu-
latory initiatives was vetoing EPA's proposed implementa-
tion of a Clean Air Act requirement for industry to secure
state  permits  to  increase  emissions  of  any  pollutant.49
Although  the  EPA  proposal  seemed  to  track  closely  the
logic of the statute50  the Competitiveness  Council success-

The  pattern  of anti-environmental  changes  achieved
through Council intervention in other regulatory proposals
is  entirely  consistent  with  these  examples.  The  Council
helped  to derail  an  EPA effort to  reduce sulphur  dioxide
emissions  from  the  Navajo  Generating  Station,  which,
among other things, had obscured the view of Grand Can-
yon.55  The Council tried to press upon EPA a revised defi-

would have lowered protections on one-third  of American
wetlands, as earlier defined, including a majority of forested
wetlands.56  The  Council intervened  to  persuade  the  Fed-
eral Aviation  Administration  to relax  its requirements  for
phasing out noisy aircraft under the Airport Noise and Ca-

Such  was  the  regulatory  oversight  system  dedicated
most faithfully to a categorical separation of powers philos-

countability.  But even without  careful parsing, the record
suggests obvious accountability issues.  First, it was the con-

I1.  EXECUTIVE  ORDER  NO.  12,866: REINVENTING
REAGAN-BUSH  GOVERNMENT
Although  the  Council  on  Competitiveness  provided
the political backdrop to President Clinton's regulatory re-
form efforts, it did not supply the model.  Instead, both the
structure and strategy of President Clinton's Executive Or-
der  No.  12,866  have  obvious links  to  President  Reagan's
Executive  Order  No.  12,291,68  under  which  OIRA  con-
ducted regulatory oversight even through the Bush Admin-
istration.  Both orders commence with statements of overall
presidential  goals  and  with principles  of regulatory  policy
that the orders directly impose on the agencies within their
purview.  Both orders coordinate centralized  regulatory re-
view  through the Office  of the Vice President  and the Of-
fice of Management  and Budget.  Each contemplates both a
general regulatory planning process for individual agencies,
plus separate regulatory impact analyses as a tool for man-
aging  the  oversight  process  for  certain  significant  regula-
tions.  Neither  order  purports  to  deprive  any  agency  of
decision  making  power  that  Congress  has  vested  in  the
agency.
Within  this common  framework, however,  there  exist
truly  significant  differences.  These  differences  render  the
Clinton regulatory review process-at least on paper-less
biased against regulation, more consultative,  more accessi-
ble,  and  more  deferential  to  policy  making  by individual
agencies.  On its face, the resulting system is more suscepti-
ble  to  "checking  and  balancing"  by  Congress  and  the
courts.
A.  Presidential Objectives
President Reagan  stated the objectives underlying Ex-
ecutive  Order No.  12,291  in succinct  and, with one excep-
tion, generally nonsubstantive  terms:
to reduce the burdens of existing and future regulations,
increase  agency  accountability  for  regulatory  actions,
provide for presidential oversight of the regulatory pro-
68.  Exec. Order No. 12,291, 3 C.F.R. 127 (1981), reprinted in 5 U.S.C. § 601
(1988).19951 POLITICAL ACCOUNTABILITY 175
cess, minimize  duplication  and conflict  of regulations,
and insure well-reasoned  regulations.69
The only hint of genuinely substantive regulatory  policy in
this preamble is the desire to reduce regulatory "burdens,"
which  foreshadows  the  subsequent  RB  deregulatory  em-
phasis on cost-benefit  analysis.
Executive  Order No. 12,866  reaffirms  the value  com-
mitments of the  12,291 preamble, but adds others:
The American people deserve  a regulatory system that
works for them, not against them:  a regulatory  system
that protects and improves their health, safety, environ-
ment, and well-being and improves the performance of
the economy  without imposing unacceptable  or unrea-
sonable costs on society; regulatory policies that recog-
nize that the private sector and private markets are the
best  engine  for  economic  growth;  regulatory  ap-
proaches that respect the role of State, local, and tribal
governments; and regulations  that are effective, consis-
tent, sensible, and understandable.7"
Conspicuous  in this prose  is acceptance  of a positive case
for regulation.  It is conceived that a regulatory system can
"protect[  ] and improve[ I . ..  health, safety, environment,
and well-being and improve[ ] the performance of the econ-
omy . . . ."  Undue burdens are decried as in 12,291; there
should be no "unacceptable  or unreasonable  costs on soci-
ety."  But costs  are, by  implication,  not unreasonable  if a
regulation  efficiently facilitates an important social  goal.
There are additional ways in which the Clinton pream-
ble plainly seeks to distance itself from a philosophy it tac-
itly imputes to RB regulatory  review:
[t]he objectives  of this Executive order are to enhance
planning and coordination with respect to both new and
existing regulations; to reaffirm the primacy of Federal
agencies in the regulatory  decision-making  process;  to
restore the integrity and legitimacy of regulatory review
and oversight; and to make the process more accessible
and open to  the public.  In pursuing  these  objectives,
the regulatory process shall be conducted so as to meet
69.  Id.

applicable  statutory requirements  and with due regard
to the discretion that has been entrusted to the Federal
agencies.71
The apparent negative implications of the italicized phrases
are that earlier  Administrations  had (1) compromised  the
decision  making primacy  of federal  agencies,  (2) jeopard-
ized the integrity  and legitimacy of regulatory review, and
(3) cloaked regulatory oversight in too much secrecy.  Reas-
serting the primacy of individual agencies and opening reg-
ulatory policy making to public scrutiny are two strategies,
which,  if implemented, could  significantly diffuse  effective
power over regulatory decision making within the executive
branch.
B.  Mandatory Principles of Regulation
Both the Reagan  and Clinton  orders  move  beyond a
hortatory preamble  statement  of general goals  to specific
principles  that  the  respective  Presidents  would  require
agencies to follow to the extent otherwise permitted by law.
The  essential  commands  of  the  Reagan  order  are  easily
summarized:  to  regulate  only  where  regulatory  benefits
outweigh costs, and to choose regulatory means that mini-
mize the net cost of the administrative initiative.72  There is
little elaboration in the order as to how such decisions shall
be made.
The  Clinton  order  focuses  on a similar mandate,  but
describes it  with greater nuance.  The section  on  "regula-
tory philosophy"  purportedly limits the occasions for regu-
lation, but does so in a way that rhetorically acknowledges
the frequent legitimacy of regulation:
Federal  agencies should promulgate  only such  regula-
tions as are required by law, are necessary to interpret
the law, or  are  made  necessary  by  compelling  public
need,  such  as material  failures  of private  markets  to
protect or improve the health and safety of the public,
71.  Id. (emphasis added).

§ 601 (1988).1995] POLITICAL ACCOUNTABILITY 177
the  environment,  or  the  well-being  of  the  American
people.7
Although echoing the earlier order's call for cost sensitivity,
the Clinton order cautions against an overreliance  on "hard
variables":
Costs and benefits shall be understood to include both
quantifiable  measures  (to  the  fullest extent  that these
can be usefully  estimated) and qualitative measures  of
costs and benefits that are difficult to quantify, but nev-
ertheless essential to consider.74
The order explicitly articulates a number of regulatory ben-
efits that are not readily monetizable:
[I]n choosing among alternative regulatory approaches,
agencies  should select those approaches that maximize
net benefits (including potential economic, environmen-
tal, public health and safety, and other advantages; dis-
tributive impacts; and equity) ....5 
The Clinton order gives additional guidance on the an-
alytic process by which its philosophy is to be implemented.
Prior to issuing any new regulations, agencies are instructed
to consider  whether  administrative  objectives  may  be  ac-
complished through alternatives to new regulation, includ-
ing the  modification  of existing  schemes.76  Yet, even this
direction to seek cost-effectiveness is modified by an analy-
sis facially more complex than straightforward  bottom-line
analysis:
In [designing regulations in the most cost-effective man-
ner],  each agency shall consider  incentives for innova-
tion,  consistency,  predictability,  the  costs  of
enforcement and compliance  (to the government, regu-
lated  entities,  and  the  public),  flexibility,  distributive
impacts, and equity.77
There  are  also  specific  requirements  for  agencies  "to  the
extent feasible,  [to]  specify performance  objectives,  rather
than specifying  the behavior or manner of compliance that
73.  Exec. Order No. 12,866, 3 C.F.R. 638, 638-39 (1993), reprinted in 5 U.S.C.

regulated  entities must adopt, '78 and "[w]herever  feasible,
[to]  seek views of appropriate  State, local,  and tribal  offi-
cials  before  imposing  regulatory  requirements  that  might
significantly  or  uniquely  affect  those  governmental
entities. "79
Institutionally,  these  directives  have  significance  be-
yond the obvious replacement of a conservative Republican
regime  with  an  Administration  of  moderate-to-liberal
Democrats.  Because  agencies  issue regulations  almost ex-
clusively  pursuant  to  congressional  mandate,  the  Presi-
dent's rhetorical acceptance  of a potential positive role for
regulation immediately aligns his policy stance more closely
with the stance of Congress, which must have envisioned a
positive  role  for  regulation  in  authorizing  the  regulatory
process  in the first place.  Moreover,  the more eclectic set
of presidentially  approved regulatory  concerns-including
"public  health and  safety,  and  other  advantages;  distribu-
tive  impacts; and equity"-creates  a value  structure  more
readily aligned with the policies underlying a host of regula-
tory statutes, none of which necessarily embodies the pro-
crustean cost-benefit  orientation of the RB approach.  The
broader  framework that the order endorses for assessing a
regulation's  appropriateness  would  additionally  support  a
broader-based,  less bounded  consultation  both within and
outside  the  Adminstration  as  to  the justification  for  any
particular regulatory  initiative.
C.  General  Regulatory Planning
Both the Reagan and Clinton orders envision a general
regulatory planning process.  Executive  Order 12,291  man-
dated only a portion of that process, which President Rea-
gan  later amplified  in Executive  Order No.  12,498.80  The
key  planning  tool  under  12,291  was  the  "regulatory
agenda,"  earlier mandated by President Carter.  Order No.
12,291 required each agency to publish a semiannual sched-
ule of "proposed regulations  that the agency  has issued or

expects to issue, and currently effective rules that.are under
agency review. .. "81  The agenda was to include a summary
of each rule,  "an approximate  schedule for completing ac-
tion  on any major  rule for which  the agency  has issued a
notice  of proposed rulemaking,"  and information  on con-
tacting  agency  officials  knowledgeable  about  the  matters
listed.82
Executive  Order No. 12,498,  issued in early 1985, just
prior to  the  advent of the  second  Reagan Adminstration,
ordered  a yet more full-blown regulatory planning process.
Each agency was required to develop and submit in draft to
OMB an annual "Regulatory Program."  The order empow-
ered  the  OMB director  to review  the  draft programs  for
consistency  with  Administration  policies,  and  to  identify
further  "regulatory  or deregulatory  actions as  may,  in his
view,  be necessary in order to achieve such consistency. "83
The President  or a cabinet  council  would resolve  any  dis-
agreements  over such recommendations.84  Otherwise,  the
agency  head  would  submit  the  agency's  final  regulatory
program for publication; the Director, before issuing, could
then circulate it for further interagency comment and con-
sultation.85  Agency  heads  were  finally  obligated  to  notify
the  Director  immediately  of  any  regulatory  actions  in-
tended  during the next year  that had not previously been
submitted for review.86
Executive  Order  No.  12,866  substitutes  for  both  of
these  Reagan orders  a planning  process  that is  in various
ways more fluid and more elaborate.  The threshold differ-
ence, however, lies in the very range of agencies required to
participate.  The  Reagan  orders  applied  to  every  agency
covered by the fairly comprehensive  definition of "agency"
in the Paperwork  Reduction Act, excluding those listed in

that Act as "independent  regulatory agencies.  The regu-
"87 
latory  analysis  provisions  of  the  Clinton  order  have  the
identical  purview,88 but  the  general  planning  system  ex-
tends  further, embracing  the independent  agencies, whom
the Reagan  Administration had only invited  to participate
voluntarily in the 12,291  regulatory review  process.89
The Clinton planning process is prefaced  by a general
allocation  of authority to those  whom  the  order treats  as
the key "players" in regulatory planning  and review.  First,
the  agencies  themselves  are described  as  "responsible  for
developing regulations and assuring that the regulations are
consistent  with  applicable  law,  the  President's  priorities,
and  the principles  set forth in  [the  Clinton  executive]  or-
der."90  OMB is  charged  with the  "coordinated  review  of
agency rulemaking," both to help insure, as do the agencies,
that regulations are consistent with both law and the Presi-
dent's policies, but also to see "that decisions made by one
agency do not conflict with the policies or actions taken or
planned by another agency."91 The Vice President is desig-
nated "the principal advisor to the President" on regulatory
matters, and is ordered to "coordinate the development and
presentation  of  recommendations  concerning,  regulatory
policy, planning, and review. "92
Within this framework, the Clinton order envisions an
annual "planning  cycle,"  early in which the Vice President
shall convene  a  meeting of the so-called  "Advisors,' 93 to-

93.  Under the order, these include:

Policy; (4) the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy; (5) the Assis-

retary; (9)  the Assistant  to the President and Chief of Staff to the Vice
President; (10) the Assistant to the President and Counsel to the President;1995] POLITICAL ACCOUNTABILITY
gether  with  the  heads  of  agencies.  The  purpose  of  the
meeting is "to seek a  common understanding  of priorities
and to coordinate regulatory  efforts to be accomplished  in
the upcoming year. '94  As under the Reagan system, during
the  planning  cycle  each  agency  is  required  to  prepare  a
"Unified  Regulatory  Agenda"  and  a  "Regulatory  Plan,"
with  contents  similar  to  those  mandated  in  the  earlier
orders.95
Upon receiving an agency's Regulatory Plan, however,
the Clinton order neither envisions an indefinite period for
unilateral  OMB review,  nor  bestows  discretion  over  the
Plan's interagency circulation to the Director.  Instead, each
agency is ordered to forward its annual plan to OMB's Of-
fice  of  Information  and  Regulatory  Affairs  by  June  1;
OIRA, in turn, is  required  in all  cases  to  "circulate  it  to
other affected  agencies,  the Advisors, and  the Vice Presi-
dent. '96  The intended result is presumably a significant dif-
fusion of official authority to raise issues about a plan, and a
consequent reduction in OMB's exclusive power to second-
guess agencies.  The  order permits  any "agency  head who
believes that a planned regulatory action of another agency
may conflict with its own policy or action taken or planned"
to raise that issue with the issuing agency, the Advisors, and
the Vice President.97  The Administrator  of OIRA  is like-
wise  authorized  to  alert  that  same group  if she "believes
that a planned regulatory action of an agency may be incon-
sistent with  the  President's  priorities  or the  principles set
forth in [the] Executive order or may be in conflict with any
policy or action taken or planned by another agency."98
It is noteworthy  that the  circulation  of the  plan  pre-
sumably leaves the initiating agency an opportunity to mo-
bilize  its allies, as well  as to  arouse  its opponents,  among
(11)  the Deputy  Assistant to the  President  and Director  of the  White
House  Office  on Environmental  Policy;  and  (12)  the Administrator  of
OIRA.

other  agencies.  Moreover,  the  order  directs  that  "[t]he
Plans developed by the issuing agency shall be published an-
nually in the October publication of the Unified Regulatory
Agenda."99  The italicized language and the absence of any
reference  in the order to the submission of a "draft plan,"
strongly  suggests  that  OMB  does  not  have  authority  to
preclear or to stop publication  of a plan  that an agency is
prepared to publish.100
The multilateral  and highly consultative nature  of the
planning  process  that  the  order  envisions  is  underscored
emphatically  by  two  additional  provisions.  The  first  is  a
mandate to the Administrator of OIRA to convene a Regu-
latory Working Group (RWG), including the heads of each
agency  with  "significant  domestic  regulatory  responsibil-
ity," plus the Advisors and the Vice President.10  The RWG
is charged to meet at least quarterly in its role as:
a forum  to assist agencies  in identifying and analyzing
important  regulatory  issues  (including,  among  others

Additionally,  the  Administrator  of  OIRA  is  required  to
"meet quarterly with representatives of State, local, and tri-

requires agencies to delay the publication of "any regulatory action that is subject to
review under section 6"  of the order.  Id. (emphasis  added).  Because regulatory
plans are subject to review under section 4, not section 6, the negative implication of
this provision is that agencies need not stay the publication of their plans pending
OMB review or approval.

mental organizations,  and the  public to  discuss regulatory
issues of common concern.'10 3  These provisions potentially
regularize an influential form of public input at the regula-
tory planning  stage that  goes  significantly beyond the  no-
tice-and-comment  opportunities  linked  to  individual
regulatory proposals.
In  designing  its  planning  process,  the  drafters  of the
Clinton order apparently inferred an additional lesson from
their predecessors.  Executive  Order  12,291  did  no  more
about old regulations than (1) require agencies,  in general
terms, to "initiate reviews of currently effective rules in ac-
cordance  with the purposes  of this  Order,'10 4 and  (2)  em-
power the OMB director to designate certain existing rules
for  regulatory  analysis.0 5  In  contrast,  the  new  order  re-
quires  each agency to submit to OIRA:
a program, consistent with its resources  and regulatory
priorities,  under which the  agency will  periodically re-
view  its  existing  significant  regulations  to  determine
whether  any  such  regulations  should  be  modified  or
eliminated  so as to make  the agency's  regulatory pro-
gram more effective in achieving  the regulatory objec-
tives, less burdensome, or in greater alignment with the
President's priorities and the principles set forth in [the]
Executive  order.106
Moreover,  the  RWG,  and  state, local,  and  tribal  govern-
ments are asked to participate  in the process of identifying
outmoded  regulations  or  rules  otherwise  in  need  of  re-
form.07  The Vice President, in consultation with the Advi-
sors, is authorized to:
identify  for review  by the  appropriate agency  or agen-
cies other existing regulations of an agency or groups of
regulations of more than one agency that affect a partic-
ular group, industry, or sector of the economy, or may

The obvious aim of this effort is to avoid subjecting to ex-
tensive review  only new regulations  that, of necessity,  are
most likely to reflect the most up-to-date  information and
policy  thinking,  while  leaving  untouched  regulations  that,
equally  of necessity,  do not  reflect current information  or
policy consultation.
D.  Regulatory Review.
Most of the remainder of both the Reagan and Clinton
orders  is devoted  to their  respective  review  processes  for
individual  regulations.  The orders adopt virtually identical
definitions for the "regulations"  they cover.109  The Clinton
-rder addititonally covers  "regulatory  actions,"  defined as:
any  substantive  action  by  an  agency  (normally  pub-
lished in the Federal  Register)  that promulgates  or is
expected to lead to the promulgation  of a final rule or
regulation, including notices of inquiry, advance notices
of  proposed  rulemaking,  and  notices  of  proposed
rulemaking. 10
From  this  universe  of  administrative  activity,  each  order
then seeks to focus regulatory review only on regulations or
regulatory actions  that are  "major"  or "significant.""'
Here, the orders articulate a significant substantive dif-
ference.  The Reagan  order measured the significance  of a
regulation entirely in cost terms:
"Major  rule" means any regulation  that is likely to re-
sult in:
108.  Id.
109.  The only obvious difference is that both exclude from their coverage regu-
lations that relate "to a military or foreign affairs function of the United States,"
except that the Clinton order carves out of this exception "procurement regulations
and regulations involving the import or export of non-defense articles and services,"
which are made subject to the order.  Compare Exec. Order No. 12,291, 3 C.F.R. 127
(1982), reprinted in 5 U.S.C. § 601 (1988) with Exec. Order No. 12,866, 3 C.F.R. 638,

(1) An annual effect on the economy of $100 mil-
lion or more;
(2)  A major increase in costs or prices for consum-
ers, individual  industries, Federal,  State, or local gov-
ernment agencies, or geographic regions; or
(3) Significant adverse effects on competition, em-
ployment,  investment,  productivity,  innovation,  or  on
the ability of United States-based  enterprises  to com-
pete  with foreign-based  enterprises in domestic or ex-
port markets." 2
Any rule  falling  within  this  Reagan  order  definition
would be deemed  "significant"  under the Clinton order  as
well." 3  But a regulation or regulatory action under the new
order  will  also  be  deemed  significant,  and, hence,  poten-
tially subject to centralized  review,  if it could:
(1) Adversely affect in a material way..,  the envi-
ronment, public health or safety, or ...  tribal govern-
ments or communities;
(2)  Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise in-
terfere  with  an  action  taken  or  planned  by  another
agency;
(3) Materially  alter the budgetary impact  of enti-
tlements,  grants,  user  fees,  or  loan  programs  or  the
rights and obligations of recipients thereof; or
(4)  Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of
legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the princi-
ples set forth in this Executive order." 4
Potentially, this coverage significantly softens  the apparent
anti-regulatory bias of the RB regulatory review process.  A
rule may now be reviewed if it could significantly hurt the
environment, public health, or safety, or diminish the rights
of individuals receiving government entitlements, grants, or
loans.  Excessive  cost, in other words, is not the only "red
flag"  to arouse OMB's attention.
Beyond differences  in the regulatory  actions  covered,
the orders are similar, but not identical, in their strategy for

review.  The key review mechanism  under the Reagan or-
der  was  the  "Regulatory  Impact  Analysis"  (RIA),  which
each  agency was required to  perform "in  connection with
every  major  rule.'1 15  In  the  ordinary  case16-that  is,
rulemaking  initiated  by a  notice  of proposed  rulemaking
(NPRM)-each  agency would  prepare  a  preliminary  RIA
to  accompany  each  NPRM  and  submit  both to  OMB at
least 60 days prior to publication." 7  A final RIA would ac-
company a final rule, both of which would be submitted to
OMB 30 days  prior  to publication." 8  The RIA would in-
clude, in essence, an assessment  of a major rule's expected
costs  and  benefits,  and  a  description  of  alternative  ap-
proaches  that might  be  more  cost-effective,  but  were not
chosen." 9
Although not using the RIA terminology, the Clinton
order requires a similar analysis  for all "significant  regula-
tory  actions,"  unless  OIRA  waives  the  requirement.2°
OMB's capacity to use regulatory  review for the indefinite
delay  of a  regulatory  action appears,  however,  to be  sub-
stantially curtailed.  The Reagan order authorized the OMB
director or his designee (who turned out be the Administra-
tor  of OIRA)  to  review  all  proposed  and final  RIA's.121
Upon the request of the Director, an agency was required:
[to] consult with the Director concerning the review of a
preliminary  Regulatory  Impact  Analysis  or  notice  of
proposed rulemaking under this Order, and ...  refrain
from  publishing  its  preliminary  Regulatory  Impact
Analysis  or notice  of proposed  rulemaking  until  such
review  is concluded.122

Likewise:
Upon receiving notice that the Director intends to sub-
mit views with respect  to any final Regulatory  Impact
Analysis or final rule, the agency shall ...  refrain from
publishing its final Regulatory Impact Analysis or final
rule  until  the  agency  has responded  to the  Director's
views,  and incorporated  those views  and  the  agency's
response in the rulemaking file.'23
Absent  from  these  provisions  was  a  deadline  for  OMB
either to complete its review of a proposed RIA or to sub-
mit  its comments  for a  final  rulemaking.  The impact  one
might have predicted,  a lengthy extension of the rulemak-
ing process for any regulation opposed by OMB, seems to
have occurred.124
The Clinton order, in contrast, includes a tight timeta-
ble within which a  review process is to proceed.  OMB  is
subject to  strict deadlines  at  each stage of review, and, in
reviewing  any proposed  or final  regulatory  action,  is per-
mitted to extend its process only "once by no more than 30
calendar days upon the written approval of the Director."125
Moreover:
[f]or  each  regulatory action  that  the Administrator  of
OIRA returns to an agency for further consideration of
some  or  all  of  its  provisions,  the  Administrator  of
OIRA [is required to] provide the issuing agency a writ-
ten explanation for such return, setting forth the perti-
nent provision of this Executive. order on which OIRA

The requirement that OIRA focus its concerns in writing is
a potentially significant  mechanism for avoiding undue de-
lay in regulatory review.  The exercise of putting objections
in  writing  may  discipline  OMB  in  lodging  objections  be-
cause it requires some precision of scope  and explanation;
when  an  objection  is  lodged,  the  agency  will  presumably
also be better off by having clear notice where its analytical
energies  must be focused in order to satisfy OMB.

126.  Id.188 ARKANSAS  LAW REVIEW  [Vol. 48:161
The intent to prevent undue OMB-induced  postpone-
ments of regulatory action is reinforced  by the Clinton  or-
der's  provisions  concerning  the  publication  of regulatory
actions.  As under Executive Order No. 12,291, agencies are
not to  publish regulatory  actions  subject to OIRA review
until "the Administrator  of OIRA notifies the agency that
OIRA has waived its review of the action or has completed
its  review  without  any  requests  for  further  considera-
tion.'127  However, unlike Executive  Order No. 12,291, the
new order  provides  that  extended  OIRA silence  is tanta-
mount to  authorizing  the  agency  to  publish;  agencies  are
entitled  to go  forward  if "the  applicable  time period  ...
expires  without OIRA having notified the agency that it is
returning  the  regulatory  action  for  further  considera-
tion.'128 The intended consequence of these provisions is to
render OMB more accountable  in the discharge of its func-
tions and to restore a more even balance of power between
the agency and  OMB in fine-tuning agency regulations.
E.  Sunshine Provisions.
Yet another respect in which the Clinton order differs
markedly from Excecutive Order No. 12,291 is in its codifi-
cation  of  disclosure  provisions  and protections  against  ex
parte contacts.  Both orders require agencies to make their
regulatory analyses available to the public once the relevant
regulatory  action is published.129  The Clinton order, how-
ever,  codifies  certain  disclosure  measures  voluntarily
adopted  by  OMB  during  the  Reagan  Administrations,3°
even though not required to do so by Executive Order No.

to Congress's refusal to reauthorize  OIRA when its statu-
tory mandate  expired in 1990.131
First, the Clinton order contains significant protections
to insure  that  agencies  are not  subject  to  pressures  from
OMB based  upon  outside  communications  of which  the
agencies were never informed.  Under Executive Order No.
12,866, "[o]nly  the Administrator of OIRA... is permitted
within  OMB to receive  oral  communications  initiated  by
persons not employed by the executive branch of the Fed-
eral  Government  regarding  the  substance  of a  regulatory
action under OIRA review.'1 32  An agency representative is
entitled  to  attend  any  "substantive"  meetings  between
OIRA  personnel and persons not employed by the execu-
tive branch  regarding  a regulatory  action under  review.133
With respect to such actions, OIRA is required to:
forward to the issuing agency, within 10 working days of
receipt  of the communication(s),  all written communi-
cations, regardless of format, between OIRA personnel
and any person who is not employed  by the executive
branch of the Federal Government, and the dates  and
names  of individuals  involved  in  all  substantive  oral
communications  (including  meetings  to  which  an
agency  representative  was invited, but did not attend,
and telephone conversations between OIRA personnel
and any such persons).3
Moreover, the public is entitled to significant informa-
tion  about  the  review  process,  even  while  it  is  ongoing.
OIRA is commanded  to:
maintain a publicly available log that shall contain, at a
minimum, the following information pertinent to regu-
latory actions under review:
(i) The status of all regulatory actions, including if
(and if so, when and by whom)  Vice Presidential  and
Presidential consideration was requested;

ings  and telephone conversations,  between OIRA per-

branch  of the  Federal  Government,  and  the  subject
matter discussed during such communications.135,
This log is to be supplemented  with additional information
once a regulatory action is published or the agency  decides
not to go forward.  At that point, "OIRA shall make avail-
able to the public all documents exchanged between OIRA
and the agency  during the review by OIRA under this sec-
tion. '136  This  is  a  dramatic  change  of  policy,  given  the
scope of RB resistance  to the disclosure  of documents re-
vealing  the  deliberative  processes  entailed  in  regulatory
policy making.
F.  Conflict  Resolution.
A final significant  area of difference between  the two
orders lies in the Clinton order's formalization of a process
for conflict resolution in connection with regulatory review.
Executive  Order  No.  12,291  did not expressly provide  for
any such mechanism.  Its only hint-because the OMB Di-
rector was generally subjected to the supervision of a Presi-
dential Task Force on Regulatory Relief-was that agencies
caught at impasse with the Director could resort to the Task
Force  on appeal.  While  in existence,  that Task Force was
chaired  by  then-Vice  President  Bush,  rendering  the  Vice
President  a  potential intermediary  in  regulatory  disputes.
In fact, however, the Task Force was dormant from the mid-
dle of the first Reagan Administration until the late middle
of the second Reagan Administration.137  There was thus no

137.  Percival, supra note 7, at 152; Editorial, Bush Business, 244 THE NATION
420 (1987).1995] POLITICAL ACCOUNTABILITY
codified  appeal  route  for  an  agency  challenging  OMB's
resistance  to its policy judgments.138
The Clinton order codifies just such a vice presidential
role.  In  the  event  of  issues  "between  or  among  agency
heads or between OMB and any agency that cannot be re-
solved by the Administrator of OIRA,"  conflicts are to "be
resolved by the President, or by the Vice President acting at
the request of the President, with the relevant agency head
(and,  as  appropriate,  other  interested  government  offi-
cials).' 39  Vice presidential  and  presidential  consideration
of such disagreements, however,  "may be initiated only by
the [OMB] Director, by the head of the issuing agency, or
by the head of an agency  that has a  significant  interest in
the  regulatory  action  at  issue.' 140  The order  underscores
the limited range of persons authorized to invoke presiden-
tial or vice presidential review of regulation:  "Such  review
will not be undertaken at the request of other persons, enti-
ties, or their agents.' 14'  In light of the Council on Competi-
tiveness experience, discussed above, the apparent message
is clear: presidential or vice-presidential review is not to be-
come a vehicle for special interests outside the government
to acquire covert leverage over a policymaking process they
cannot control through more generally available opportuni-
ties for public participation.  Indeed:
[d]uring  the Vice  Presidential  and Presidential  review
period, communications with any person not employed
by the Federal Government relating to the substance of
the regulatory action under review and directed to the
Advisors or their staffs or to the staff of the Vice Presi-
dent shall be in writing and shall be forwarded  by the
recipient to the affected agency(ies)  for inclusion in the
public  docket(s).  When  the  communication  is  not in
writing, such Advisors or staff members shall inform the

OMB objection following consultation with the White House. Percival, supra note

outside party that the matter is under review and that
any comments should be submitted in writing.'42
To date, not enough can be known about the operation
of Executive  Order No. 12,866  to be certain how great the
contrast will prove to be between RB regulatory review and
its successor.  It is conspicuous,  however,  that the drafters
of the order wanted to create impressions of greater consis-
tency between the aims of regulatory  review and the value
structure animating Congress, greater deference to individ-
ual agencies as policy makers, and more openness in regula-
tory review.  As discussed below, each of these aspects of
the Clinton's approach arguably augurs well for political ac-
countability, although they diffuse policy making influence
and  soften  the  seeming  hierarchical  rigidity  of  RB
oversight.
III.  POLITICAL  ACCOUNTABILITY  AND  REGULATORY
OVERSIGHT
A.  What is Accountability?
Some prominent champions of the categorical vision of
separation  of powers143-and,  indeed,  even enthusiasts  of
somewhat  more restrained  versions  of the so-called  "uni-
tary executive "144-insist  that tighter White House coordi-
nation  of  executive  policy  making  would  increase  the
executive's  "accountability."  Those  who  read  categorical
separationism  into the framers'  intent insist that the fram-
ers' original accountability concerns dictate a strong version
of the  "unitary  executive"  as  a  constitutional  mandate. 45
Others, such as Professors Lessig and Sunstein, disavow this
originalist interpretation.  But Lessig and Sunstein pose an
argument  that the  powerful  potential contribution  of  the
"unitary  executive"  to official  accountability  might none-
theless be sufficient to sustain a modernist "unitarian" read-

ing of the Constitution-one that yields, albeit on different
intepretive  premises, an equivalent  constitutional  mandate
of  highly  centralized  presidential  control  of
administration.146
As I noted at the outset, however, the debate over the
President's policy prerogatives and their relationship to ac-
countability  clearly  has significance  beyond  disputes  over
constitutional  interpretation.  Just as frequently  at  issue in
most recent discussions is which of various political control
models  Congress  ought to  follow  as a  matter of policy in
designing  administrative  programs.147  Unfortunately,  the
competing  positions  in  this  debate-or,  more  accurately,
what is truly at stake in the competing positions-does not
lend itself to easy sound-bites.
In one sense, the  debate seems  to be about  the com-
parative wisdom of following two fairly  distinct models of
President-bureaucracy  relationship.  Under  one  model,
which we  can call the  "presidentialist"  model, Congress is
urged to exercise its own policy making discretion to struc-
ture  a  department  or  a  decisional  process  in  a  way  that
maximizes  the possibility for presidential review.  Congress
is,  of course,  entitled to  make bureaucratic  policy  makers
removable  at the  President's  will,  to subject  certain  deci-
sions expressly to presidential review, or even, if it chooses,
to authorize  something  like the  OIRA  regulatory  review
process  as a statutory mandate.  Following  another model,
however, typically called the "independent  agency"  model,
Congress could  alternatively  use its discretion to structure

ing.148  Given these alternatives, it becomes clear why prob-
ing  the  relationship  between  presidential  authority  and
agency accountability  is  doubly relevant for enthusiasts  of
the unitary executive.  Even if dispassionate analysis cannot
yield a persuasive constitutional  mandate for the presiden-
tial  control  model, it  might at  least  persuade  Congress  to
delegate  presidential  authority  more  generously  on  the
ground that, as a normative proposition, strong presidential
oversight  of the bureaucracy is a good thing.149
But to think of the available  alternative  to "presiden-
tialism"  as  independent agencies,  though  a  common  locu-
tion,  is  surely  misleading.  The  heads  of  so-called
independent  agencies  are still largely  susceptible  to presi-
dential  influence.  This  may be  because  Presidents choose
the  agency  heads,  or  because  presidential  involvement  in
their budget processes  is critical,  or because such agencies
still  need  presidential  support for legislative  initiatives,  or
simply  because  the  President,  because  he  is  President,
knows  how  to  get  attention.5°  Moreover,  despite  Con-
gress's obvious tools of influence vis-a-vis agencies, it oper-
ates  within  an  institutional  framework  that  categorically
prohibits the legislative branch from actually implementing
the laws of the United States.15   Thus, the more obviously

Congress seeks to whittle its way into the actual processes
of law administration, the more vulnerable its maneuvers to
legal and political resistance  become.
For these reasons, the alternative  to "presidentialism"
is not really agency  policy independence  or even "congres-
sionalism."  The real-world  alternative is probably  best de-
scribed  as  "political  pluralism.'152  In  the pluralist  world,
the President may still, within statutory limits, seek to influ-
ence the policy outcomes of administrative agencies.  He is
not,  however,  constitutionally  guaranteed  any  dispositive
"last say" in policy making that may legitimately and invari-
ably trump the influence of other political forces.
Other commentators  do not  deny the pluralist  reality
that Presidents face.  Indeed, some, such as Professor Cala-
bresi and Lee  Liberman, seem to  deny  that "presidential-
ism"  and  "political  pluralism"  are  even  genuine
alternatives.  They suggest that Presidents invariably  oper-
ate  within such politically  tangled environments  that, in a
significant  sense,  giving  the  President  a  constitutionally
guaranteed "last say" over all bureaucratic policy would not
affect outcomes very much.153  Competing forces are always
so strong that a presidentialist bureaucracy would be, more
or less, the pluralist bureaucracy we now have anyway.
That  speculation,  however,  seems  ironic,  especially
coming from Ms. Liberman, who served President Bush so
ably as an Associate Counsel to the President.  If we credit
the hypothesis  of insignificance,  then the extraordinary ef-
forts of both the Reagan  and Bush Administrations to es-
tablish their legal claims to presidential  policy control over
the entire bureaucracy would appear utterly irrational.  Not

any  particular normative  theory  of politics,  for example,  "pluralism,"  as  distin-
guished from "civic republicanism."  See WILLIAM  N. ESKRIDGE, JR. & PHILIP P.

only would they have risked (and incurred) significant judi-
cial rebukes and congressional antagonism, but they would
have done so for no genuine reason.  That seems implausi-
ble.  It  seems more  likely,  given  how  strongly  Presidents
have urged the presidentialist  model, that a presidentialist
bureaucracy  and  a  politically  pluralist  bureaucracy  would
behave in significantly different ways.
One  dimension  of that  difference  might  well  be  ac-
countability.  Unfortunately, it is a striking feature  of most
of the "unitary executive"  literature  that it gives little sus-
tained  attention  to  what  "accountability"  means.5  The
connection  between presidential  control  of administration
and accountability  is  offered as self-evident.  Of course,  if
one simply  defines  "accountability"  as the  vesting of ulti-
mate  decisional  authority in a  person who  is elected,  not
appointed,  it  is,  indeed,  self-evident  that  the  President  is
elected, and bureaucrats  are not.  Voters  have one-albeit
no more than one-opportunity to vote "No" on extending
a President's White House stay.  Bureaucrats do not run for
office.
But no adequate  analysis can rest entirely on that ob-
servation.  The point of accountability,  by definition,  must
surely  be  the  actual  operational  capacity  of any  decision
maker to be held to account.  It is not at all self-evident that
the President  is more accountable  in this sense than other
public officials.  Moreover,  once we address  accountability
in  operationally  realistic, non-tautological  terms  of actual
responsiveness, it is clearly imperative to ask: Exactly who
is empowered  to  hold decision makers  to  account,  when,
and for what?  The answers to these questions are far from
obvious.  To pursue them, it is important to consider a vari-
ety of hypotheses  as to the kinds of accountability that one
can imagine  achieving, at least in part, by attending to the
allocation of policy making control within the executive.
154.  Professor Calabresi's contribution to this symposium is a notable exception
to this generalization, given his systematic attempt to link the unitary executive with
a clearly expressed model of responsiveness  to a national electoral  constituency.
Calabresi, supra note 1, at 58-70.1995] POLITICAL ACCOUNTABILITY
1.  Accountability to Public Opinion
One obvious possibility  would be to pursue accounta-
bility as embodied in a policy maker's fidelity to the current
policy preferences  of the  electorate  at large.  Can we pre-
dict that a strong unitary executive would be more likely to
be  accountable  in  this sense  than  an  executive  exhibiting
fairly diffuse policy making power?
The answer seems obviously negative.  There is no evi-
dence that  the President,  at any given moment,  embodies
that set of policy predilections  across  a wide  set of issues
that is held by a contemporaneous  majority-or, more ac-
curately, by contemporaneous majorities of Americans.  In-
deed, one of the most remarkable  features of the  Reagan
Presidency was the dissonance between his strong electoral
mandates  and the public's  apparent rejection  of his policy
positions  on  a  variety  of highly  significant  issues.155  This
emphatically  is true with respect to environmental  regula-
tion.  Throughout the RB era, consistent and overwhelming
majorities  of Americans  subscribed  to the  view  that  the
quantity of U.S. environmental  regulation was appropriate
or too low.'56  The position implemented by the Council on
Competitiveness-that  we  have  too  much  environmental
regulation-has  never  approached  becoming  a  majority
view in the last 20 years.
There  is  one most  obvious reason  why the  President
would mirror  public  opinion polls  quite imperfectly-the
155.  For example, the Reagan Administration never secured anything approach-
ing majority support for its policy of aiding the Contras. BENJAMIN I. PAGE & ROB-

over, despite their ardent anti-abortion stances, neither President Reagan, nor Presi-
dent Bush, ever persuaded a majority of Americans that abortion should remain
unavailable in most cirumstances.  The percentage of people who say they support
Roe v. Wade actually rose in the late 1980s, and after a temporary dip in early 1992,
continued to rise to a rate of 65%  support in January, 1993.  Joan Biskupic, Argu-

legislature governed by majority rule cannot reach an optimal "resolution  among
three  or  more mutually  exclusive alternatives  that  are voted on  pairwise."  Es-
KRIDGE & FRICKEY, supra note 152, at 50. Given presidential candidates who repre-
sent dozens of alternative policy positions on matters of interest to voters, it is surely
even less plausible that an electoral victory for a single candidate represents an opti-
mal resolution of voter disagreements on all of those issues.  On the "practical im-
possibility  in our political  system of ascertaining  mandates"  through presidential
elections, see NELSON W.  POLSBY & AARON B. WILDAVSKY, PRESIDENTIAL ELEC-
TIONS: STRATEGIES OF AMERICAN ELECTORAL POLITICS 268-74 (6th ed. 1984).
Although the thoughtfulness of his overall discussion is surely impressive, Pro-
fessor Calabresi tries to dodge this argument with what seems to me a conspicuous
and unresponsive example of pleading in the alternative.  First, he urges, citizens
should  not worry about presidential nonresponsiveness  because Presidents adjust
their positions over time. Calabresi, supra note 1, at 68-69.  But, even if they don't,
citizens still should not worry because Presidents are out of office in four or eight
years, in any event, and the business cycle likely ensures that neither "the cultural
right or the cultural left will dominate the presidency over time."  Id. at 69.
These arguments are unpersuasive because neither meets the point that a Presi-
dent, while in office, has significant latitude to be nonresponsive to popular majori-
ties.  This is so, not as conjecture, but as fact.  Presidents Reagan  and Bush never
had majority support for their views on the Contras or on environmental policy; they
never shifted their views to accommodate the majority. Moreover, in Reagan's case,
presidential elections did not prove a significant disciplinary force.  In Bush's case,.
they perhaps did, but only after four years in which the White House was consist-
ently out of touch with the popular majority's views of environmental policy-and
without effective recourse. Professor Calabresi's assurance that "bundling is a prob-
lem, at most, for short periods of time," id. at 69, is true only if one counts four years
as "short," which no politician does.1995] POLITICAL ACCOUNTABILITY
est relevant opinion poll would presumably be so conspicu-
ously  lacking  in  any  internal  compass  as  to  call  into
question at least the President's capacity for leadership, not
to mention his mental health.
Fans of the unitary Presidency  are fond of pointing to
the  framers'  explicit  decision  neither  to  vest  executive
power  in  a  plural  executive,  nor  to  create  an  executive
council  to  guide  the  President.158   As  much  as  anything,
however, that decision reflects an implicit rejection of polit-
ical representativeness  as  an intended feature  of the chief
executive.  Had  representativeness  been the goal,  surely a
multiple presidency would have been preferable.159
Moreover, the President's incentives to follow the polls
in any close way are not as strong as is often assumed.  Af-
ter all, despite common academic references  to a presiden-
tial  candidate's  unique  "national  constituency,"  any
candidate  is subject to election only twice.  Two considera-
tions seem to outweigh all others in recent choices  of Presi-
dents-public satisfaction  (or the lack of it) with economic
performance  under the most recent incumbent, and a gen-
eral  sense  of an incumbent  President's  personal  perform-
ance.160  Thus, during both an initial campaign  and another
for reelection,  a  presidential  candidate  knows  that his de-
tailed stances  on matters  of policy  are not likely to  make
decisive  differences  in  his  political  fortunes.  And,  of
course, following a successful reelection campaign, there is
158.  Professor Calabresi, for example, celebrates the framers' decision to sweep
the "plural executive forms into the ash bin of history."  Calabresi, supra note 1, at

159.  In a wonderfully original and provocative analysis, John Rohr has suggested
that the Senate was imbued with significant executive powers-and, indeed, concep-
tualized by the framers as possessing a partly executive character-to compensate,
in part, for the nonrepresentative  character of the Presidency. JOHN A. ROHR, To

On Election Day, 1992, 42%  of the voters responding to a poll by a consortium of
television news organizations identified "the economy" as the most important issue
in casting their votes.  The closest runners-up were the "federal deficit" and "health
care"-both closely correlated to economic worries-with 21 and 20%, respectively.

no further  prospect of confronting  the  electorate  to disci-
pline a President's policy judgments.
If bureaucratic  accountability  to  elected  politicians  is
to be  used  as  a  structural mechanism  aimed  at achieving
direct  responsiveness  to public opinion, it would  probably
make more sense to intensify the influence that Congress-
especially the House-has over the agencies.  Members  of
Congress are eligible for reelection indefinitely;  a common
observation of the House is that its members are in a con-
stant election campaign.  One would thus expect the policy
output of Congress to track public opinion more conscien-
tiously  than  would  the  President's  day-to-day  agenda,  as
did,  indeed,  the  pro-environmentalist  Congresses  of  the
6
1980s.1 1
There  is,  however,  an obvious complication  here.  To
the  extent a  President  relaxes  his  policy  oversight  of  an
agency, one expects to find a shift in policy influence not to
Congress in general, but rather to the committees that over-
see a particular agency.162  The influence OIRA loses is pre-
sumably  the  influence  that  committee  chairs  gain.  Thus,
even  if the  policy  predilections  of Congress  track  public
opinion closely, a particular committee might not be an ef-
fective microcosm  of Congress.
Interestingly,  an  important  recent  study  may  assuage
that  concern.  Professors  Kiewiet  and  McCubbins  argue
that the majority parties in Congress have effectively dele-
gated power  through the  committee system  in a  way  that
yields  "a  strong  and  systematic  influence"  by  the  parties
over Congress as a whole. 63  If committees  actually repli-
cate the dominant policy views of Congress as a whole, then

accountability  to committees might  be a decent proxy for
accountability  to dominant public opinion.164
It is important to remember that elected officials' pres-
sure  upon  policy making  bureaucrats  is likely to be  most
salient  when  two conditions  prevail.  First, as  is  common,
the relevant administrators must be implementing a statute
that affords them sufficient policy making discretion within
the  four  corners  of  the  statute  to  make  pressuring  the
agency  worthwhile.  Were  any  statute  to  provide  a  truly
wooden  administrative  recipe,  the  institutional  pressure
simply to conform to the law would likely overwhelm polit-
ical  demands  to  depart  from  it.  Second,  pressure  from
political officials will be most important as an independent
mechanism  for  achieving  accountability  to  current  public
sentiment  when  significant  time  has  elapsed  between  the
enactment  of a  statute  and its implementation.  When  an
agency's  task  is to  implement  a  statute  enacted  quite  re-
cently,  then  the  statutory  enactment  itself should  reflect
dominant national sentiment.  Any pressure to conform to
such sentiment-as  opposed to pressure simply to enforce
the  law-would  seem  superfluous.  In  other  words,  con-
formity to the value  structure  animating a  very recent en-
actment will suffice  to produce policy outcomes consistent
with the views of a contemporary  majority.
Indeed, when an agency is administering a recently en-
acted law, the independent political pressures of a presiden-
tialist hierarchy  can dangerously  derail an agency's  fidelity
to  the  political  intentions  underlying  the  act.  Assuming
that the statute leaves implementing  administrators  signifi-
cant  room  for  discretionary judgment,  a  President  vested
with  strong  control  powers  could  pressure  the  agency  to
adopt a mode of implementation  more reflective of his uni-
lateral preferences than of the compromise among compet-
ing positions that had to be struck in order to get the law
enacted.'65  The  President  may  abandon  his  bargains  be-
cause Congress can discipline the President only by legislat-
164.  See K. KREHBIEL, INFORMATION AND LEGISLATIVE ORGANIZATION (1991).
165.  For a game-theory explication of this point, see Matthew D. McCubbins et
al., Structure and Process, Politics and Policy: Administrative Arrangements and the
Political Control of Agencies, 75 VA. L. REV. 431, 435-40 (1989).202 ARKANSAS  LAW REVIEW  [Vol. 48:161
ing  over  the  President's  veto-a  formidable  task  under
almost all political circumstances.'66
It is of considerable interest that several political scien-
tists have recently suggested that our traditional, procedur-
ally oriented structure of administrative  law, which assigns
significant  decisional  independence  to individual  agencies,
may be well designed precisely to secure administrative  ac-
tion  consistent  with  the  transactional  intent  embodied  in
whatever statute authorizes that action.67  The argument is
complex, controversial, and far from conclusive. 68  It raises
serious issues, however, for anyone claiming that fidelity to
public opinion  requires  tight presidential  oversight  of ad-
ministrative decision making.
2.  Accountability to Affected  Interests
For a  different  reason, it  might  be that checking  bu-
reaucratic behavior through the control of any political offi-
cial  will  be  unsuccessful  in  enabling  current  popular
majorities to secure administrative decisions consistent with
their  views.  Politicians  may  simply  be  less  responsive  to
electoral  majorities  per se  than  to  dominant  sentiments
among those persons whose stake in a government decision
are great enough to promote  their organization into  effec-
tive  pressure  groups.1 This is  not  invariably  a  problem.
69 
Responsiveness to those most affected by bureaucratic deci-
sion making might even be a preferable accountability goal,
especially  if we were confident that all those who stand to

gain or lose substantially through a particular decision were
represented with equal effectiveness.
Under  this  model,  however,  a  tight concentration  of
power  over bureaucratic  decision  making  would  seem  to
impede,  rather  than  advance,  the  cause of accountability.
The  interests  affected  by truly  significant  regulatory  deci-
sions are likely too numerous and diverse.  They need real-
istic opportunities to secure the effective representation  of
their  views,  and meaningful  mechanisms  for  a  policy dia-
logue that seriously takes account of all that is at stake in an
administrative  decision.  Neither  of  these  accountability
preconditions  is  well served  by rigid  hierarchical  decision
making.  It is precisely the large size and relative openness
of Congress that makes it realistic to hope that all interests
relevant to a policy decision will find some effective legisla-
tive  representation  and  voice.  If ultimate  policy  making
power were lodged in a single individual, such an arrange-
ment necessarily would increase the chances that one inter-
est or set of interests will have disproportionate access and
influence. 70
It  is  troubling  yet again  from  an  "affected  interests"
perspective on accountability that the presidentialist model
would  so  easily  permit a  President  to disturb  the equilib-
rium that such interests have reached in striking  a bargain
over authorizing legislation.  It is only when  Congress,  the
President, and public interest groups enjoy rough parity in
their capacity  to  shape  agency  behavior  that  the political
environment  is  likely to replicate  the conditions  that pro-
duced  whatever  legislation  the  agency  is  implementing.171
In other words, vesting policy authority in an administrator
who  enjoys independent discretion, but who  also faces po-
litically  pluralist decision  making conditions,  is most likely
170.  As one recent commentator has said: "[Any suggestion that resisting spe-

By  contrast,  neither  Congress,  nor  members  of  the
public most affected  by regulatory  decisions,  seriously can
hope  to  discipline  the  abandonment  by  a  "unilateralist"
President of an earlier compromise once a piece of author-
izing  legislation  is  enacted.  A  President's  faithlessness
rarely is sufficient to animate a two-thirds legislative major-
ity against him, and his abandonment of particular interests
in a particular episode is not likely to be so important to his
reelection  prospects-if he  has any-to deter a  President
determined to go his own way.
3.  Accountability to the "Public Interest"
There  is,  of  course,  yet  another  political  tradition
within  which  to  construct  an ideal  of  accountability.  We
could  hope for a  system  most likely to check  the bureau-
cracy not when it veers from majority opinion, or even from
the opinions dominant among the most affected parties, but
rather when  it departs  from a more dispassionately  deter-
mined "public interest" that may or may not coincide with
polling results.  Such, of course, was James Madison's orga-
nizational  ideal.  He argued for a  constitutional design in-
tended  above  all  to  constrain  the  influence  of "faction,"
which he brilliantly defined as:
a number of citizens,  whether amounting to a majority
or minority of the whole, who are united or actuated by
some  common  impulse  of passion,  or  of interest,  ad-
verse to the rights of other citizens, or to the permanent
and aggregate interests of the community.173
Professor Cass Sunstein is among the most energetic of
our colleagues  in centering  public  law  scholarship  on  the
Madisonian  ideal.74  His work  properly gives  prominence
172.  For an argument  that public interest  groups assist in  this dynamic,  see

to open, vigorous government dialogue as perhaps the chief
constitutional  instrument  for elevating  the  public interest
over faction.17  But, if he is  right on these counts-and I
think he  is-then he undermines  the Lessig-Sunstein case
for the plenary presidential removability of administrators.
Administrative  decision making  in  the public  interest  re-
quires an extension to the executive branch of a policy dia-
logue  that  is  vigorous,  thorough,  and  reasoned.  As
Professor Luneberg has argued, the plenary removability of
administrators  is far more likely to inhibit, rather than ad-
vance  robust  intrabranch  policy debate.176  To  achieve  in-
trabranch  dialogue,  it is thus important  not to tighten  the
reins on subordinates, but to provide incentives for subordi-
nates to speak freely and for the President actually to listen
to diverse  voices  despite the predictable  dominance  of his
177
own.
Besides  the  virtues of dialogue,  those  who  believe  in
the  ascertainability  of a  "public  interest"  beyond  opinion
polls are likely also to trumpet the virtues of dispassionate
expertise  as  a  central  feature  of  administrative  decision
making.  Expertise provides a foundational rationale for the
entire phenomenon  of specialized  agencies under different
administrators.  Each agency,  because of its discrete  juris-
diction and sustained immersion in particular categories  of
problems, is expected  to develop a base  of knowledge  and
methodological  sophistication  intended  to  protect  against
decision making based solely on passion or "interest."
Because  the ideal of expertise argues so obviously for
diffusing  policy making  authority  to  specialized  agencies,
contemporary advocates of presidential control typically as-
sert  that  "we"  have  now  outgrown  any  naive  New  Deal
faith in neutral expertise  as  a governing  force in decision
making.  Lessig and Sunstein argue that "once  one sees the
nature of administration as fundamentally political...  the

whole  notion  of  independent  political  bodies  becomes
highly problematic.' 178  But, there is a real world of differ-
ence  between  "fundamentally political"  and  "exclusively
political."  It is far from obvious that only the naive among
us can aspire  to policy making that, while deeply political,
also  has  a  serious,  well-trained,  technically  sophisticated
and disciplined eye on a reality apart from politics.  After
all,  even  a  politically  anti-abortion  Surgeon  General  was
able  to  determine  during  the  most  socially  conservative
Presidency of this century that extensive study had failed to
yield  credible  evidence  that  abortion  produces  enduring
psychological  trauma in once-pregnant women.179  Such an
episode reveals a bureaucratic capacity to attend to fact in a
way that exemplifies  an important  bureaucratic  ideal.180  If
the country wants decision making attentive to "the perma-
nent  and aggregate  interests of the community,"  thought-
fully  determined,  then decision  making  structures  should
maximize  opportunities  for  transcending  partisanship  and
ideology.  Tightly hierarchical  structures do not.

180.  A case I frequently discuss with administrative law classes in this respect is
Association of Nat'l Advertisers v. Federal Trade Comm'n, 627 F.2d 1151, cert. de-
nied, 447 U.S. 921 (1980)[hereinafter ANA].  In ANA,  the D.C. Circuit rebuffed a
trade association's  attempt to disqualify FTC Chairman Michael  Pertschuk from
participating in a rulemaking that proposed restrictions on television advertising di-
rected to children, including ads for "sugared products."  Pertschuk had, to put it
mildly, expressed a proregulatory disposition on the issue, calling for a "fundamental
assault on  television' advertising  directed  toward  young  children."  Id. at  1191
(MacKinnon, J., dissenting in part and concurring in part).  The Court nonetheless
drew a categorical distinction between adjudicatory policymaking aimed at the neu-
tral discernment of specific facts and the more politicized, value-centered function of
general policy making.  It held that an administrator could be disqualified from par-
ticipating in a policy making proceeding only upon "a clear and convincing showing
that [the decision maker] has an unalterably closed mind on matters critical to" the
process.  Id. at 1154.
This may be fine as a judicial standard, but the implication that personal opin-
ion may appropriately submerge all other considerations in even so obviously polit-
ical a rulemaking is highly troubling. It would surely have been objectionable if the
FTC regulated advertising to children without any dispassionate inquiry as to the
nature of children's understanding of advertising, the actual harms from an overcon-
sumption of sugar and their prevalence, the likely effectiveness of alternative regula-
tory approaches in changing behavior, and so on.  I I1995] POLITICAL  ACCOUNTABILITY 207
4.  Transparency in Decision  Making
Among  the papers I've misplaced  over the years, one
of  my  favorites  was  a  cartoon  of  two  figures  speaking
against the backdrop of the Capitol dome.  One says to the
other:  "I  love  the separation  of powers.  No  matter what
goes wrong, there's always somebody else to blame."  Such
a jibe might suggest that, whatever the answer to my earlier
query-"Who is empowered to hold decision makers to ac-
count,  when,  and  for  what?"-presidential  bureaucratic
control would  be helpful  because  it would  help  answer  a
briefer question:  "Who's to blame?"  In other words, it is a
problem that anyone authorized to hold decision makers to
account in a politically pluralist system is nonetheless often
unable to identify the relevant decision makers.  The fram-
ers expressly noted this problem in deciding to vest execu-
tive power in a single, rather than in a plural President:
[O]ne  of the weightiest  objections to a plurality  in the
executive  is that it tends to conceal faults and de-
. . .
stroy responsibility  [T]he multiplication of the ex-
.... 
ecutive adds to the difficulty of detection ..... 8
From this point of view, the virtue of presidentialism would
be its contribution  to decisional transparency.
Despite  the  crispness  of this proposition,  it is  in  one
sense  operationally unlikely  and, in another, operationally
insignificant.  It is operationally unlikely because, to a great
extent, even the vesting of ultimate decisional  authority in
the President will not undo the ubiquitous possibilities  that
a complex bureaucracy affords to disavow responsibility for
unpopular  choices  and  to  claim  the  chief credit  for  suc-
cesses.  Presumably, the President already exercises numer-
ous  authorities  and  functions  of  which  the  public  is
unaware,  and  which  the  White House  does  not  highlight.
As related  above, a  major goal  animating the Council  on
Competitiveness  was  to  keep  the  President  personally
uninvolved in contentious regulatory decision making.  The
likely intent was to give the President  the prerogative-at
least in friendly audiences-to embrace the Council whole-
'181. THE FEDERALIST No. 70, at 427-28 (Alexander Hamilton)(Clinton Rossiter
ed., 1961).208 ARKANSAS LAW REVIEW  [Vol. 48:161
heartedly  for advancing his values, while  keeping  intact-
presumably in other audiences-the plausibility of denying
direct  responsibility  for  any  particular  thing  the  Council
had done.
Indeed, for those who embrace categorical separation-
ism as a constitutional reading, this problem is exacerbated
by their faith in executive privilege.  Under United States v.
Nixon, the President's entitlement  to keep his communica-
tions at least presumptively confidential is rooted in the no-
tion that the executive must be able effectively to discharge
inherent executive  power.182  It would have to follow logi-
cally that ascribing to the President an extravagant range of
inherent power would correspondingly expand his capacity
to keep  his secrets.  That privilege would  make it  harder,
not  easier,  to  determine  "whom  to  blame."  And,  if the
point were not obvious from logical analysis alone, it would
be  proved by Congress's  conspicuously  greater success  in
overseeing domestic policy making-where executive privi-
lege  claims  are  most dubious-than  foreign  and  military
policy making-where  executive  privilege claims tradition-
ally are most credible.83
The reason  for the  insignificance  of the  transparency
argument  is  that, even  without  plenary  power  to  second-
guess all bureaucratic policy makers, the President may well
be held generally and properly accountable  for overall bu-
reaucratic performance in any event.  That is because voters
know the President has appointed all key policy makers and
the  most  important  managers  of  executive  affairs.  The
President's value structure is likely to dominate the bureau-
cracy even if he is not formally able to command all impor-
tant policy decisions.  Professor Abner Greene has recently
catalogued  a series of reasons why this is so: OMB reviews
virtually all agency budgets; the Attorney General controls
most agency litigation; the President's support may be criti-
cal  to an  agency  in its negotiations  with  Congress.84  For
these reasons, Presidents  do not inevitably  have less infiu-
182.  418 U.S. 683, 705-06 (1974).

ence  over  "independent"  agencies  than  they  do  over
"purely executive"  establishments.185
There  is, in addition, another reason for thinking that
any link between presidential  policy control  and decisional
transparency is a red herring.  As noted earlier, the alterna-
tive  to  presidentialism  is  political  pluralism,  not  genuine
agency  independence.  Presidents  always  have  influence,
but, in a  pluralist world,  they have to compete  on a more
level  playing  field  with  Congress  in  keeping  the  heat  on
agency administrators.  Conversely, if the President were to
enjoy more and more complete control over the content of
domestic policy, then the weaker the identifiable link would
become  between  legislator  effectiveness  and  government
performance.  There seems to be a kind of "conservation of
accountability"  law  at work  here, under  which  decisional
transparency on one end of Pennsylvania Avenue becomes
plausible  deniability on the other.  The more public  lever-
age over the President becomes an effective lever over bu-
reaucratic output, the less effective  congressional elections
would seem to be in achieving policy accountability.
B.  Accountability and  Regulatory Oversight
Once we attend to the genuine intricacies  of what ac-
countability means,  any easy equation disappears between
the ideal of accountability  and  the practice of tight White
House control over regulatory  policy making.  At the very
least, that equation becomes far too controversial to sustain
the argument that accountability  concerns  mandate  a con-
stitutional  reading  that  necessitates  complete  presidential
control of agencies.'86
We  have  identified  at  least  three  political  measures
against which to hold government decision making account-
able: the majority views among voters, the dominant senti-
ments  among  affected  parties,  and  a  dispassionately
determined  public  interest.  Moreover,  our governmental

dependent Agency Independent?, 15 CARDOZO L. REV. 273 (1993).

and PresidentialP ower: A ConstitutionalA  nalysis, 57 GEO. WASH. L. REV. 596, 623
(1989).210 ARKANSAS  LAW REVIEW  [Vol. 48:161
system  contains a  variety of instruments  that could plausi-
bly be  used  to  secure  some  correspondence  between  bu-
reaucratic  decision  making  and  any  of  these  measures.
These  include  presidential  elections,  congressional  elec-
tions,  presidential  oversight,  congressional  hearings,  ap-
pointments  and  removals,  confirmation  proceedings,
administrative  procedures, judicial review, and grass  roots
public pressure.
But what accountability requires, under all the theories
mentioned, is a set of political conditions that is fairly com-
plex.  Perhaps  the most important  is widespread  access to
information about  the nature of the decisions  at issue.  A
second is policy dialogue, and a third, a multiplicity of op-
portunities  for dialogue to be well-informed  and salient  to
actual decision making.  A fourth is flexibility  in the value
structure  of bureaucratic  decision making.  The more pro-
crustean  the  decision  making  environment,  the  less  ac-
countable  it  is  to  anyone  but  to  the  ultimate  decision
maker.
By each  of these measures,  the  model  of regulatory
oversight depicted in Executive  Order No. 12,866 looks far
more attractive than the model actually operationalized  by
President  Bush's Council  on Competitiveness.  The  Order
envisions considerable  openness  in the regulatory  process,
and relatively  broad public  access to  relevant  intrabranch
and  outside  communications.  The  Council,  in  sharp  con-
trast,  strove  to  keep  its policy  input  confidential.187  It  is
perhaps  more  than  symptomatic  that  the  average  lawyer
would find it difficult to locate the obscure memoranda that
chartered  the  Council,  as  compared  to  the  codified  and
readily accessible  description  of regulatory  process the  ex-
ecutive order provides.
Second, the Clinton executive  order is far more toler-
ant of diffuse policy making  influence.  OIRA's capacity to
strong-arm  agencies is reduced both in the formal descrip-
tion of its powers and through its susceptibility to deadlines.
As a consequence, more relevant actors have more plausi-
187.  See supra text accompanying notes 58-64.1995] POLITICAL ACCOUNTABILITY 211
ble opportunities to contribute to the policy making process
in an influential way.
Finally, the order is more eclectic  than the Council-
and than President Reagan's earlier executive order-in its
articulation of an appropriate value structure to guide regu-
latory policy making.  The problem confronting  the drafter
of any such directive, whether an executive order on regula-
tion  or  the  increasingly  ubiquitous  "strategic  plan"  for
higher education, is to be concrete  enough to be meaning-
ful, while remaining general enough to be sound.  It seems a
fair prediction that policy making consistent with the tenor
of the Clinton executive order will weigh certain policy pri-
orities over others; its philosophy,  however,  does  not ele-
vate  any  one  single  value  (such  as  efficiency)  to  so
dominant a position as to pose an immediate and inelucta-
ble  conflict  with  the  competing  goals  animating  a  wide
range  of statutes.
Of course,  this analysis suffers  the  distortion of com-
paring a paper model of policy making with flesh-and-blood
experience.  My observation, however, is that the actuality
of the  Council  on  Competitiveness  only  substantiates  the
analytical problems I earlier  identified in linking  the ideal
of  accountability  to  tightly  controlled,  highly  centralized
oversight.  The Council was not effective in increasing the
correspondence  between  agency  outcomes  and  popular
opinion.  Its insistence on environmental  deregulation  con-
sistently defied majority popular sentiment.188 Nor does the
Council seem to have improved the Government's respon-
siveness to the full range of interests affected by regulation.
Pious denials notwithstanding, the alignment  of the Coun-
cil's agenda  with  that  of organized  business  strongly  sug-
gests  that  some  interests  were  treated  as  invariably
weightier than others.89  This last fact also strongly under-
mines any suggestion that the Council made a positive con-
tribution to aligning policy outcomes more consistently with
a dispassionately  determined  public interest.  The Council
seemed not to suppress special interest factionalism, but to
188.  See supra note 156.
189.  Cf. Victor, supra note 24.212 ARKANSAS LAW REVIEW  [Vol. 48:161
cater  to  it, submerging,  rather  than  elevating,  policy dia-
logue.  Its policy directives sometimes tended to ignore con-
trary  expert  judgment  in  favor  of  an  overwhelming
ideological  commitment  to  deregulation  for  its own  sake.
Such a result is unsurprising given that the Council's chair,
Vice-President  Quayle,  described himself as a  "zealot"  for
deregulation.190  Zealotry  and  the  public  interest  would
seem unlikely companions.
IV.  CONCLUSION
Once we plumb the complexities  of both defining and
operationalizing  accountability,  a  strong case  appears  that
tight  unitary  control  of  the  executive  is  a  problematic
model.  Virtually  every plausible  normative  version  of ac-
countability  seems to depend  quite strongly on the availa-
bility of multiple pressure points within the bureaucracy,  a
diffusion of policy making influence, public dialogue,  and a
general  fluidity  in the value  structure  that guides  the  bu-
reaucracy's  decision making.  In all these respects, the sys-
tem described in ideal terms by Executive Order No. 12,866
would  clearly  be preferable  to the actual  operation  of the
Council on Competiveness.
For constitutional theorists, these conclusions have two
implications.  If originalist  interpretation  does  not  sustain
an argument for inherent presidential  power to control all
bureaucratic  decision  making in domestic affairs,  then the
case for categorical separationism as a constitutional  com-
mand must fail altogether.  A realistic account of the actual
mechanics of government accountability does not categori-
cally  link the "unitary  presidency"  with  the accountability
ideal.  Thus,  contrary  to the  Lessig-Sunstein  thesis,  func-
tionalist reasoning does not provide the argument for presi-
dential  control  that  originalism  fails  to  support.  The
reverse is more likely to be true.
Second, even if the  originalist  argument for presiden-
tial control is stronger than I believe, a President with con-
stitutional  authority  to  engage  in  a  tightly  hierarchical
mode of bureaucratic  management might serve the country
190.  Woodward & Broder, supra note 21, at Al.1995] POLITICAL ACCOUNTABILITY 213
best  through presidential  forbearance.  As Professor  Sha-
piro has argued  recently in a thoughtful  article,  the Presi-
dent  would  likely  help  create  the  greatest  public  welfare
gains, not through micromanagement  of individual regula-
tions, but by fostering careful planning of the bureaucracy's
regulatory  agenda  and  promoting  interagency  coordina-
tion.191  Again,  the  Council  on  Competitiveness  provides
the wrong model to follow.
It is finally worth emphasizing, however, that the rela-
tionship between general institutional structures and actual
political  behavior is  likely to  be a loose one.  The "purely
executive"  EPA under a Reilly or Ruckelshaus proved no-
tably  less  compliant  than  the  "independent"  Reagen-era
FTC, FCC, and NLRB.  Recognizing that the scope of pres-
idential influence over the bureaucracy is itself a legitimate
subject  of political contestation would  allow that scope to
vary-perhaps  as  functionally  appropriate  to  the  bureau-
cratic tasks at hand. 92
For all these reasons, constitutional  theorists who prize
bureaucratic accountability should abhor any reading of the
Constitution  that  mandates  a  single  structural  route  to-
wards its realization.  The Constitution's contribution to ac-
countability depends primarily upon its structure of checks
and balances.  Keeping agencies aitentive to multiple voices

. I-share his worry and concur in his regret, but not with his characterization  of
arguments of the type I have made.  My argument fully embraces  the President's
political role. And my vision of the Constitution is profoundly pro-politics because

subject of political struggle, and (2) assures that bureaucratic agencies will be politi-
cally buffeted from many sides, not only by the President.214  ARKANSAS  LAW REVIEW  [Vol. 48:161
