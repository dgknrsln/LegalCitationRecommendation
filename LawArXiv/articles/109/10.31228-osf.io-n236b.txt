The Supreme Court likely will soon weigh the constitutional validity of recent presidents’
use of the recess appointment power. Ohio State Law School professor Peter M. Shane out-
lines the history of the power and how it has grown in importance in a time of chronic con-
gressional gridlock and obstruction.
He says the justices are not likely to adopt the D.C. Circuit panel’s reasoning in Noel Can-
ning v. NLRB, which severely cut back the president’s power. But they could drastically
modify or virtually eliminate it in different ways.
