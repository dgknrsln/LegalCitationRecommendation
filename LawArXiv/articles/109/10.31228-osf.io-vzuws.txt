If the Senate soon confirms a full complement of members for the National Labor Rela-
tions Board, the Obama administration should ask the Supreme Court in Noel Canning v.
NLRB to remand the case, without decision, to be re-heard by the NLRB , author Prof. Pe-
ter Shane of Ohio State Law school writes. The court should grant the request, showing a
judicial restraint for which the Roberts bench is not known—and returning the recess ap-
pointments controversy to the elected branches of government, where it belongs.
