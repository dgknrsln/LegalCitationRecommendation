INTRODUCTION 
Tribes  are  sovereign  nations  that  maintain  a  government-to-
government relationship with the Unites States.2 There are currently 567 
federally recognized tribes throughout the contiguous United States and 
Alaska.3 As sovereign nations, tribal authority cannot be infringed upon

by states;4 however, the U.S. Supreme Court has held that Congress 
holds the authority to legislate on issues related to tribes and American 
Indians and Alaska Natives.5 The federal government also maintains a 
trust responsibility towards tribes based on treaties, agreements, statutes, 
and case law.6 This trust responsibility, known as the Trust Doctrine, is 
“a legally enforceable fiduciary obligation on the part of the United 
States to protect tribal treaty rights, lands, assets, and resources, as well 
as a duty to carry out the mandates of federal law with respect to 
American Indian and Alaska Native tribes and villages.”7 
In  addition  to  political  sovereignty,  tribes  exercise  cultural 
sovereignty in the form of traditions and religious practices unique to 
each  tribe’s  own  history  and  culture.8  “[C]ultural  sovereignty 
encompasses the spiritual, emotional, mental, and physical aspects” of 
native people’s lives and serves as a foundation to tribal exercise of 
political sovereignty.9  
As sovereign nations, tribes have inherent authority to protect the 
public health and welfare of their citizens and “to make their own laws

measures  to  prepare  and  manage  public  health  emergencies  in  the 
manner most appropriate for their communities. Coupled with existing 
federal statutes, there are multiple mechanisms for tribes, either directly 
or  through  a  state  or  the  U.S.  federal  government,  to  declare  an 
emergency or receive the benefits of a federal declaration.11 This Article 
summarizes several types of emergency declarations, including tribal 
declarations,  Stafford  Act  declarations,  and  federal  public  health 
emergency declarations, and their implications for tribes.12 
I.  TRIBAL DECLARATIONS 
As sovereign nations, tribes have the authority to declare states of 
emergency on tribal lands.13 This authority may be granted through a 
tribe’s  constitution,  legal  code,  or  the  inherent  authority  of  their 
governing councils.14 Several tribes have exercised their authority to 
declare emergencies in recent years.

States” and quoting United States v. Wheeler, 435 U.S. 313, 322-323 (1978), which 
states that tribal “inherent powers of a limited sovereignty . . . [have] never been 
extinguished”). Declaring an emergency is an exercise of sovereignty. See LAWRENCE O. 
GOSTIN, PUBLIC HEALTH LAW: POWER, DUTY, AND RESTRAINT 11 (2d ed. 2008) (stating 
there is an “inherent prerogative of the state to protect and promote the public health, 
safety, and welfare”). Id. at 20.

08.pdf. 36  Michigan State International Law Review  [Vol. 24.1 
For example, the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe’s constitution grants the 
tribe the power to declare a state of emergency.15 On May 27, 2013, the 
tribe’s chairman declared a state of emergency after excessive rainfall 
caused  flash  flooding  and  threatened  roads,  homes,  and  the  tribe’s 
irrigation system.16 The declaration stated that, pursuant to Article IV, 
Section 1(c)(j)(o) of the tribe’s constitution, the tribe has the authority 
“to safeguard and protect general welfare, property, cultural and natural 
resources of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe.”17 Because of the threat the 
floods posed, the chairman authorized all appropriate tribal resources and 
personnel  to  respond  and  directed  the  tribe  to  use  resources  in 
coordination with federal, state, and local government agencies.18 This 
declaration  was  ordered  to  be  effective  until  June  9,  2013,  unless 
extended as necessary.19 
In another example, the Tribal Business Committee of the Ute Tribe 
of the Uintah and Ouray Reservation (“the Tribal Business Committee”) 
declared an emergency due to flooding and landslides that occurred on 
May 20, 2011.20 The declaration did not cite a specific provision but 
stated that the Tribal Business Committee is given authority to declare an 
emergency by the constitution and bylaws of the tribe.21 Floodwater and 
landslides had damaged infrastructure, homes, cultural sites, and affected 
oil and gas operations, exhausting most of the Ute Tribe’s available

funding and resources.22 To prevent further damage and enable recovery, 
the  tribe  declared  the  affected  area  to  be  “a  disaster  requiring  aid, 
assistance and relief available pursuant to the provisions of tribal, state 
and federal statutes.”23 The Tribal Business Committee did not give an 
expiration date for the declaration.24 
In addition to authority granted by the tribal constitution, some tribes 
have codified the authority to declare states of emergency and developed 
procedures for declaring emergencies. For example, under the Cherokee 
Code of the Eastern Band of the Cherokee Nation,  
A State of Emergency shall be deemed to exist whenever during times 
of  public  crises,  disaster,  rioting,  catastrophe,  or  similar  public 
emergency,  for  any  reason,  public  safety  authorities  are  unable  to 
maintain public order or afford adequate protection for lives, safety or 
property,  or  whenever  the  occurrence  of  any  such  condition  is 
imminent.25  
.  .  .  [The  code  authorizes  the  Principal  Chief]  to  issue  a  public 
proclamation declaring to all persons the existence of such a state of 
emergency, and, in order to more effectively protect the lives and 
property of people within the Cherokee Indian trust lands, to place in 
effect any or all of the restrictions hereinafter authorized.26 
The Navajo Nation Code establishes a Commission of Emergency 
Management  (“the  Commission”),27  which  is  authorized,  “[w]ith  the 
concurrence of the President of the Navajo Nation, to declare states of 
emergency affecting the Navajo Nation or any section thereof.”28 The 
Commission’s other responsibilities include “designat[ing] emergency 
planning districts in order to facilitate preparation and implementation of 
emergency  plans”  and  “appoint[ing]  a  local  emergency  planning 
committee  for  each  emergency  planning  district,  and  supervise  and

Under the Oneida Tribe of Indians of Wisconsin’s code, the Oneida 
Business  Committee is  “responsible  for  proclaiming  or  ratifying  the 
existence  of  an  emergency  and  for  requesting  a  gubernatorial  or 
presidential declaration.”30 If the Oneida Business Committee is not able 
to proclaim or ratify an emergency declaration, the director of the tribe’s 
Emergency Management/Homeland Security Agency “may proclaim an 
emergency which shall be in effect until such time the Oneida Business 
Committee  can  officially  ratify  this  declaration.”31  All  emergency 
proclamations expire after thirty days unless renewed by the Oneida 
Business Committee.32  
Other tribes rely on the inherent authority of their governing councils 
to  declare  states  of  emergency.  In  one  instance,  the  Council  of the 
Havasupai Tribe declared an emergency by resolution due to the failure 
of a dam and high water in nearby creeks, which threatened the tribe’s 
“health, life, safety, and welfare” by destroying trails, leaving visiting 
campers  and  residents  stranded.33  The  order  did  not  cite  a  specific 
constitutional or statutory provision as providing the Council with the 
specific authority to declare an emergency.34 To aid in response, the tribe

  30.  ONEIDA TRIBE OF WI CODE § 35.8(1). The tribe’s code does not define an 
emergency or disaster. The Oneida’s Emergency Communication Plan Standards defines 
an  emergency/disaster  as  “[a]ny  incident  human-caused  or  natural  that  requires 
responsive action to protect life or property. E.g., Tornado, flood, fire, hazardous material 
spill, bomb, severe weather, aircraft accident, terrorist threat or attack, public health 
emergencies.” ONEIDA TRIBE OF INDIANS OF WI, OFFICE OF EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT/

for “Public Health Emergency” at ONEIDA TRIBE OF WI CODE § 35.3(n); however, this 
definition  applies  narrowly  and  includes  only  situations  involving  bioterrorism  or 
biological agents. See ONEIDA TRIBE OF WI CODE § 35.3(n).

resolution includes no expiration date.36 
II.  STAFFORD ACT DECLARATION REQUESTS 
The Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act 
(“Stafford  Act”)37  authorizes  the  U.S.  President  to  declare  a  “major 
disaster”  or  “emergency”  in  response  to  an  event  or  threat  that 
overwhelms state, tribal, local, or territorial governments.38 A Stafford 
Act declaration triggers access to federal technical, financial, logistical, 
and other assistance to state, tribal, local, and territorial governments.39 
Presently, there are two ways a tribe can receive benefits of a Stafford 
Act declaration: 1) a tribal request for the President to issue a Stafford 
Act emergency or major disaster declaration or 2) a state governor’s 
request for the President to issue a Stafford Act emergency or major 
disaster declaration when the tribe’s land falls within the requesting 
state’s borders.40 
A.  Tribal Request for a Stafford Act Declaration  
Before 2013, only the governor of an affected state could request a 
Stafford Act declaration from the President.41 Instead, tribes were treated 
   
Laws approved March 27, 1939, and amended on July 22, 1967, June 18, 1968, January 
27, 1992, and November 2, 2005.” Id.

much like local governments in that they were only able  to receive 
Stafford Act assistance if the governor of the state in which the tribe was 
located  first  requested  a  declaration.42  However,  under  the  Sandy 
Recovery Improvement Act of 2013, the Chief Executive of a tribal 
government can now follow the same procedures as a state governor to 
request a Stafford Act declaration from the President.43  
When requesting a major disaster or emergency declaration under the 
Stafford Act, the Chief Executive of an affected Indian tribal government 
must first ensure that “the [situation or disaster] is of such severity and 
magnitude that effective response is beyond the capabilities of the [tribe] 
and . . . that Federal assistance is  necessary.”44  As  such,  the  Chief 
Executive must take appropriate action to respond to the emergency and 
activate the tribe’s emergency response plan.45 Once the tribe’s capacity 
to  respond  has  been  exceeded,  the  Chief  Executive  must  provide 
information describing the tribe’s “efforts and resources which have been 
or will be used to alleviate the emergency,” and must “define the type 
and  extent  of  Federal  aid”  the  tribe  requires  to  respond  to  the 
emergency.46 Once the request is submitted, the President alone has the 
authority to decide whether to issue a Stafford Act declaration.47 
This  legislation  now  allows  tribal  governments  to  directly  access 
Stafford Act benefits that were once available only to the states.48 To

Emergency  Management  Agency  released  Tribal  Declarations  Pilot 
Guidance: First Draft in April 201449 and conducted listening sessions 
with tribes through August 2014 to refine the guidance.50 
The  first  tribe  to  exercise  the  ability  to  request  a  Stafford  Act 
declaration was the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians.51 On March 1, 
2013, following a request from the tribe’s Principal Chief, the  U.S. 
President issued a major disaster declaration for the tribe due to “severe 
storms,  flooding,  landslides,  and  mudslides”  that  occurred  during 
January 14 to 17, 2013.52 As a result, the tribe received more than $2.4 
million for emergency work, repair or replacement of facilities damaged 
in the storm, and hazard mitigation measures.53 
B.  State Request for a Stafford Act Declaration 
When granting tribal governments the right to request a Stafford Act 
declaration for tribal land, Congress included a savings provision to 
ensure that tribes could still receive aid pursuant to a state-requested 
declaration.54  The  law  states  that  “[n]othing  in  this  subsection  shall 
prohibit an Indian tribal government from receiving assistance under this 
subchapter through a declaration made by the President at the request of 
a State . . . if the President does not make a declaration under this 
   
deemed to refer to an affected Indian tribal government or the Chief Executive of an 
affected Indian tribal government, as appropriate.”).

now  have  the  right  to  ask  the  President  to  issue  a  Stafford  Act 
declaration, tribes are not required to submit a request for aid if the state 
in which a tribe’s boundaries fall first requests a declaration.  
III. FEDERAL PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY DECLARATIONS 
In addition to emergency declarations under the Stafford Act, federal 
law allows for public health emergency declarations for threats of disease 
or bioterrorism. Section 319 of the Public Health Service Act provides an 
additional mechanism that state, tribal, local, and territorial governments 
can use to facilitate response in the event of a public health emergency.56 
Section 319 authorizes the Secretary of the Department of Health and 
Human Services to determine that a public health emergency exists if “1) 
a disease or disorder presents a public health emergency; or 2) a public 
health emergency, including significant outbreaks of infectious diseases 
or bioterrorist attacks, otherwise exists.”57 The public health emergency 
declaration  is  in  effect  until  the  Secretary  either  declares  that  the 
emergency  no  longer  exists,  or  after  ninety  days,  whichever  occurs 
first.58 If the Secretary finds that the public health emergency declaration 
should remain in effect based on the continued existence of the original 
public health threat or the emergence of new circumstances, he or she 
may renew the declaration for additional ninety day periods.59 
A public health emergency declaration gives the Secretary the ability 
to “take such action as may be appropriate”60 and to use funds from the 
Public Health Emergency Fund (when appropriated) to respond to the 
emergency.61 The Secretary can also take actions to directly address the 
public health emergency, including:

public health emergency declaration, 1135 waivers also require either a federal disaster or 
emergency declaration under the Stafford Act pursuant to 42 U.S.C. §§ 5170 and 5191 or

department or agency personnel funded in whole or in part through 
programs authorized under the Public Health Service Act for the purpose 
of  immediately  addressing  a  federally  declared  public  health 
emergency.66 This means that if a tribe faces a federally declared public 
health emergency, and needs additional public health personnel to aid in 
response, the tribe can ask the Secretary to authorize the temporary 
reassignment  of  federally  funded  health  department  personnel  to 
respond.  
CONCLUSION 
An emergency declaration can be used as a critical public health tool 
by authorizing the use of resources and creating exemptions to legal and 
regulatory requirements that might hinder emergency response. Tribal 
and federal laws establish mechanisms through which emergencies can 
be declared on tribal lands, either directly by a tribe or through state or 
federal governments. This Article reviewed several types of declarations 
that  can  be  made  on  tribal  lands  and  the  implications  of  such 
declarations. Tribes can examine inherent authorities, tribal constitutions, 
and laws when considering an emergency declaration.
