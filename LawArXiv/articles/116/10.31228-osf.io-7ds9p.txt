The Right to Read 
LEA SHAVER* 
Reading—for  education  and  for  pleasure—may  be 
framed as a personal indulgence, a moral virtue, or 
even a civic duty.  What are the implications of fram-
ing reading as a human right? 
Although novel, a rights-based framing finds strong 
support in international human rights law.  The right 
to read need not be defended as a “new” human right. 
Rather, it can be located at the intersection of more 
familiar guarantees.  Well-established rights to educa-
tion,  science,  culture,  and  freedom  of  expression, 
among others, provide the necessary normative sup-
port for recognizing a universal right to read as al-
ready implicit in international law. 
This article argues that reading should be understood

as a universal human right.  Once recognized in prin-
ciple, it remains necessary to translate the right to 
read from a vague ideal into concrete content.  As a 
starting point, the right to read requires that every 
person be entitled to education for literacy and the 
liberty to freely choose the reading material they pre-
fer.  Less obviously, but crucially, the right to read al-
so means that everyone must have access to an ade-
quate supply of reading material.  Law and policy 
must be designed to ensure that books, ebooks, and 
other reading material are made widely available and 
affordable—even to the poor and to speakers of mi-
nority  languages.    Reframing  reading  as  a  human 
right also points to a reorientation of copyright law, 
and obligations upon publishers and technology com-
panies to facilitate access for readers of all income 
levels and in every language.  Even in legal jurisdic-
tions where international human rights law is not self-
executing, the normative framework of a right to read 
can  help  to  guide  legislative  reforms  and  private-
sector initiatives. 
A  conceptual  elaboration  of  the  right  to  read  also 
holds broader lessons for human rights theorists and 
advocates.  The right to read may be seen as an exam-
ple of a broader trend toward “intersectional” human 
rights.    Far  from  undermining  traditional  human 
rights guarantees, as proponents of the dilution theory 
contend,  intersectional  approaches  to  human  rights 
theory and practice hold particular promise to help 
transform rights from rhetoric into reality.

INTRODUCTION 
In 1969, President Nixon’s education commissioner called for 
a national campaign to realize “the right to read” for all Americans.  
Speaking to an audience of state education policymakers, he chal-
lenged: 
Imagine, if you can, what your life would be like if 
you could not read . . . if for you the door to the whole 
world of knowledge and inspiration available through 
the printed word had never opened.  For more than a 
quarter of our population this is true . . . .  These indi-
viduals have been denied a right—a right as funda-
mental as the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of 
happiness—the right to read.1 
 
 
  1.  James E. Allen, Jr., U.S. Comm’r of Educ., The Right to Read—Target for the 
Seventies, Speech at the 1969 Annual Convention of the National Association of State 
Boards of Education (Sept. 23, 1969), in RIGHT TO READ COMMITTEES OF THE AMERICAN 
ASSOCIATION  OF  SCHOOL  LIBRARIANS,  CHILDREN  SERVICES  DIVISION,  PUBLIC  LIBRARY 
ASSOCIATION, THE RIGHT TO READ AND THE NATION’S LIBRARIES 1–3 (1974) [hereinafter THE 
RIGHT TO READ AND THE NATION’S LIBRARIES].  This edited volume collects articles 
describing a large number of projects that had emerged under the Right to Read umbrella, 
identifying its origins with Allen’s 1969 speech.  
4  COLUMBIA JOURNAL OF TRANSNATIONAL LAW  [54:1 
Within a month, the U.S. Office of Education announced the 
National Right to Read Effort.2  The initiative had its share of critics, 
disappointments, and failures.3  Yet the moral appeal of a “right to 
read” remained, as did policymakers’ embrace of the goal of univer-
sal literacy.  In 1975, the U.S. Congress approved more than $300 
million to fund the Right to Read effort.4 
This invocation of a “rights” frame for efforts to promote 
reading could be seen as purely a rhetorical flourish, not intended to 
acknowledge or establish any legally cognizable entitlements.  The 
historical context, however, suggests a more nuanced view.  As the 
United States was pursuing its Right to Read Effort, the international 
community was finalizing the International Covenant on Economic, 
Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR).  The ICESCR established a 
binding legal obligation to respect, protect, promote, and fulfill the 
rights of everyone to education and to participation in cultural life.5  
The domestic push to realize the “Right to Read” for all Americans 
was therefore a natural corollary to the international trend emphasiz-
ing universal entitlements to education and cultural participation. 
In this article, I seek to outline a conceptual framework for 
understanding reading not merely as a virtuous activity generally to 
be promoted by public policy, but as a legally protected human right.  
As a starting point, this means that every person has the right to edu-
cation for literacy and the right to freely choose the reading material 
they prefer.  Less obviously, I argue that the right to read also means

  5.  G.A. Res. 2200A (XXI), annex, art. 15, International Covenant on Economic, 
Social and Cultural Rights (Dec. 16, 1966) [hereinafter ICESCR].  The ICESCR was 
finalized and opened for signatures in 1966, finally gathering enough signatories to come 
into force in January 1976.  President Carter signed the treaty during his first year in office, 
in October 1977, but the U.S. Congress never ratified it; the treaty is thus not legally binding 
on the United States.  ICESCR Article 13 enshrines the right to education; Article 15(1)(a) 
the right to cultural participation.  For greater background on the right to take part in cultural 
life, see generally Lea Shaver, The Right to Science and Culture, 2010 WIS. L. REV. 121 
(2010); Lea Shaver & Caterina Sganga, The Right to Take Part in Cultural Life:  On 
Copyright and Human Rights, 27 WIS. INT’L L.J. 637 (2010).

that every individual must enjoy access to an adequate supply of 
reading material for both learning and pleasure.  This means, in turn, 
that governments have a duty to create a legal and policy environ-
ment ensuring that reading material will be widely available and af-
fordable—even to the poor and even to speakers of those languages 
that tend to be neglected by the for-profit publishing industry.6  The 
right to read thus has characteristics of both negative rights as well as 
positive rights—it implicates both liberty interests and social welfare 
entitlements.  This makes it similar in some ways to the right to 
health care or the right to education, both of which can be realized 
only through government involvement.  Similarly, situating reading 
as a human right is precisely to insist that it must not be left entirely 
to market forces.  Rather, legal and policy measures are required to 
bring reading opportunities within reach of all people.  The right to 
read is satisfied when every individual is empowered to engage with 
an ample selection of texts on the topics of interest to them, in their 
language of choice. 
There is currently no international human rights treaty or in-
terpretative document that uses the phrase “the right to read.”  Yet 
neither would it be correct to view the project of this article as the in-
vention of a new human right.  Instead, the right to read is better un-
derstood as a more specific application or interpretation of broader 
rights already recognized in international human rights law.  These 
more generic human rights include:  freedom of expression, the right 
to education, minority rights, the right to science and culture, and 
children’s media rights.  I suggest that the right to read is already im-
plicit  at  the  intersection  of  these  well-established  human  rights, 
awaiting recognition and fuller theoretical development.  Part I of 
this article therefore begins by exploring how each of these well-
recognized human rights principles should inform an understanding 
of the right to read, and conversely, how a theorization of the right to 
read  can  inform  the  interpretation  of  these  broader  human  rights 
claims. 
Part II builds upon that textual foundation to begin to define 
the scope of the right to read.  I conceptualize the right to read as 
having three distinct dimensions:  liberty, capacity, and availability.  
Liberty refers to whether individuals are free to read without gov-
ernment interference, such as censorship.  Capacity refers to literacy 
skills, and implies a government duty to provide adequate education-
 
  6.  For a further discussion of these challenges and possible solutions, see Lea Shaver, 
Copyright and Inequality, 92 WASH. U. L. REV. 117 (2014) (exploring how copyright law 
drives up the price of books and fails to incentivize publishing in languages spoken primarily 
by poor people).  
6  COLUMBIA JOURNAL OF TRANSNATIONAL LAW  [54:1 
al opportunities to all people.  Availability refers to whether all indi-
viduals can effectively access reading materials that suit their needs 
and preferences, including dimensions of affordability and language.  
The right to read is not effectively enjoyed by a person who cannot 
afford to buy books, or has no access to the Internet, or if the availa-
ble reading material is in a language that he or she does not under-
stand. 
Both the liberty and capacity dimensions of the right to read 
are relatively familiar.  The challenges of protecting civil liberties 
and promoting literacy are already well understood.  The availability 
dimension of the right to read, however, is much less well understood 
as a problem of public policy.  My emphasis on the availability di-
mension is also more likely to be controversial as a normative matter.  
Yet I argue that this dimension of the right is also the most urgent to 
recognize and promote, precisely because its importance is so un-
derappreciated. 
Identifying the availability of reading materials as a key bar-
rier to reading may strike many readers as counterintuitive.  If you 
have come across this article, it is likely that your life experience in-
volves ready access to a much greater quantity of reading material 
than you could ever hope to process in a lifetime.  Most of the 
world’s population, however, does not enjoy this luxury.  In many 
parts of the world, books (including ebooks) remain scarce, expen-
sive, and difficult to obtain.  Sixty percent of the world’s population 
has no access to the Internet.7  Language barriers pose an additional 
problem.  As an English speaker, you enjoy access to the largest body 
of literature in the world, both in print and online.8  Yet most of the 
world’s population is not fluent in English, nor the other major lan-
guages of international publishing such as Spanish or French.  Mak-
ing reading material available in a broader set of languages is both 
particularly challenging and particularly important.9 
These problems of book scarcity and unequal access to read-
ing  material—along  linguistic,  geographic,  and  financial  dimen-
sions—have not yet received sufficient attention as a matter of law or

policy.10  It is here that the notion of a right to read may prove most 
helpful, by focusing attention on the urgent problem of availability 
and possible solutions.  Fleshing out the availability dimension of the 
right to read is therefore a central task of Part II. 
Finally, Part III explores several objections to and implica-
tions of recognizing a right to read along the lines proposed here.  Is 
it wise to invoke the rhetoric and institutional structure of human 
rights law to promote opportunities to read?  Do claims of a right to 
read  constitute  an  example  of  “rights  proliferation”  that  must  be 
guarded against?  Or can the right to read serve as a model for claim-
ing and realizing other neglected human rights?  Is the promotion of 
reading merely a desirable public policy goal that should not be con-
fused with fundamental human rights?  Does the right extend only to 
material directly useful for education and learning, or also to fiction 
and poetry, both high-brow and low-brow?  What specific obligations 
would recognition of a right to read impose upon governments, in 
terms of policy efforts to promote the right?  What human rights ob-
ligations are imposed upon corporations, such as publishers, by the 
right to read?  How could these obligations be implemented, in the 
United States and in other countries?  These are the sorts of questions 
and debates addressed in Part III of this article.  The article then 
briefly concludes. 
Before proceeding along the lines thus mapped out, I want to 
also highlight three important themes that will recur throughout this 
discussion.  These are touchstones of my approach to conceptualizing 
the “right to read,” which deserve some early clarification and em-
phasis.  They include points about linguistic diversity, comparative 
perspectives, and the meaning of human rights as legal principles. 
First, a central contribution of this article is to highlight the 
fact of linguistic diversity as a central challenge that human rights 
advocacy must reckon with.  English enjoys an exceptionally privi-
leged place today as the preeminent global language of international 
communication and commerce.  Only eight or nine languages in the 
world have more than 100 million speakers.11  A substantial portion

of the world’s population is fluent only in what I term a “local lan-
guage” such as Estonian, Malay, Quechua, Tagalog, or Zulu.  Collec-
tively there are thousands of these local languages:  each used by mil-
lions of speakers within one or a handful of countries.  For a variety 
of reasons, publishing in such local languages is dramatically more 
limited.  As a result, speakers of local languages suffer a significant 
handicap when it comes to the availability of reading material.12  For 
many people, actually exercising the right to read would require ac-
quiring fluency in a new language more favored by global publishing 
dynamics.  For much of the world’s population, however, limited ed-
ucational opportunities make such fluency an impossible dream.  In 
short, language is a critical pathway to realizing the rights to educa-
tional, cultural, and political participation.  If “the right to read” is to 
be meaningful, we must approach the challenge as one of realizing 
the right to read in every language.  Moreover, even if every single 
Estonian speaker becomes fluent in English, there remains a cultural 
value to the development and enjoyment of Estonian literature. 
Second, throughout this article I approach the “right to read” 
from a comparative perspective, considering the different challenges 
faced by countries with a diversity of economic and social realities.  
Many of the examples and topics I discuss are drawn from my own 
national context of the United States.  But I also draw on and speak 
to the very different perspectives and experiences of other countries, 
particularly the developing countries of the global South.  The chal-
lenges involved in realizing the right to read have both similarities 
and differences in the context of wealthier or poorer nations.  The 
challenges are also different depending on the linguistic context of a 
particular country.  In some nations, a majority of the population is 
born into homes that speak a language in wide international use, such 
as English in the United States or Spanish in most Latin American 
countries.  In other parts of the world, most people acquire an inter-
national language as a second tongue, if at all.  This is the case, for 
example, across Africa, where most families speak an African lan-
guage at home, but most schooling and publishing takes place in Eu-
ropean languages.  Thus, although the right to read is a universal enti-
tlement,  successful  approaches  to  realizing  it  will  need  to  take 
different forms in different countries because of differing challenges 
and resources.  This article draws on these diverse national contexts 
and challenges to provide a deeper and more nuanced understanding 
 
  12.  A more extended discussion of this problem is provided in an earlier article of 
mine.  See Lea Shaver, Defining and Measuring A2K:  A Blueprint for an Index of Access to 
Knowledge, 4 I/S:  J.L. & POL’Y. FOR INFO. SOC’Y 235, 251–53 (2008); see also Shaver, 
Copyright and Inequality, supra note 6.  
2015]  THE RIGHT TO READ  9 
of the right to read in a comparative perspective. 
Third and finally, I wish to clarify a point about human rights 
generally and the right to read specifically.  The so-called “second-
generation” human rights—including the economic, social, and cul-
tural rights such as the right to education or the right to read—are 
particularly unfamiliar and often confusing to American legal audi-
ences.  Americans are accustomed to thinking of rights claims as 
near-absolutes.  For example, once an American court accepts the ar-
gument that a certain law limits the right to freedom of speech, it al-
most always proceeds to declare that law unconstitutional.  In con-
trast, a legal opinion that upholds a law usually explains that the right 
allegedly at stake does not actually exist in that context.  Thus we 
may see U.S. legal opinions stating that minors have no free speech 
rights to receive information deemed objectionable by their parents, 
or that there is no free speech interest in communicating deceptive 
advertising.  The prevailing approach in modern U.S. constitutional 
law is to define rights narrowly, and nearly absolutely.  The interna-
tional human rights tradition takes an entirely different approach.  
Within  this  approach,  adopted  by  the  constitutional  traditions  of 
many countries, rights are purposefully defined much more broadly 
than in the U.S. Constitution, in order not to overlook any important 
values.  But these rights are not absolutes.  Thus, a right to education 
is recognized, but it does not mean that everyone is entitled to have 
the state subsidize his or her pursuit of a Ph.D.  What exactly the 
right to education does mean is a more complex question, around 
which there will be significant debate but also some basic consensus.  
Issues of cost, and the need to take competing rights claims into con-
sideration, are both relevant to determining these boundaries.  So 
when I argue for the recognition of a right to read, I am not seeking 
to invoke a human rights “trump card” in a legal or policy debate.  
Rather, I seek the recognition that there are important human rights 
interests at stake regarding reading, which merit particular care in 
policymaking and judicial treatment.  Within the framework of inter-
national human rights law, this is all taken for granted.  The task of 
elaborating the law is understood as, in the first place, understanding 
when and where human rights are at stake so they can be given due 
consideration, and in the second place, determining exactly how far 
they should be interpreted to extend in concrete circumstances.  This 
article seeks to advance along both lines, in the full understanding 
that establishing the existence of a universal human right to read is 
the beginning, not the end, of the legal and policy debate.  
10  COLUMBIA JOURNAL OF TRANSNATIONAL LAW  [54:1 
I. RELEVANT HUMAN RIGHTS PROVISIONS 
Certainly, the argument from international human rights law 
is not the only way to frame calls to promote reading.  Such argu-
ments can also be made persuasively from more general notions of 
virtuous citizenship, distributive justice, equality of opportunity, par-
ticipatory culture, social welfare, or even economic efficiency.  There 
are, however, particular advantages to invoking international human 
rights  law  alongside  these  other  normative  frames.    The  rights 
framework can bring greater attention to problems of inequality and 
exclusion, because it insists not only on broadly maximizing utility, 
but ensuring that every individual receives their due, including the 
most marginalized and vulnerable.  The human rights frame also of-
fers a legal route to challenge government actions and inactions.  
This second point has less import in the United States, where interna-
tional human rights law holds relatively little recognition or impact in 
our domestic legal order (although even here, the rhetorical frame of 
a universal right can shift political and legal discourse in powerful 
ways, with important results).  In many other countries, however, in-
ternational human rights norms are incorporated into the domestic 
constitutional  order  and  strongly  influence  domestic  political  dis-
courses.13  Thus, being able to make an argument from the standpoint 
of human rights law—rather than simply from arguments of justice or 
good public policy—opens up avenues for advocacy in the courts and 
provides a powerful frame for domestic policy debates.  Finally, the 
human rights framework opens up new avenues for advocacy in in-
ternational human rights fora and institutions. 
Utilizing the human rights framework does not necessarily 
mean, however, that we must attempt to add the right to read to the 
list  of  rights  recognized  in  the  Universal  Declaration  of  Human 
Rights (UDHR).  Instead, the right to read can be justified as an ap-
plication or extension of these well-established human rights.  Phi-
losophers, lawyers, and activists use the term “rights” to refer to a di-
verse range of claims that vary greatly in their degree of generality or 
specificity.14  Some scholars have used terms such as “generic rights” 
 
  13.  See, e.g., John Dugard, International Law and the South African Constitution, 1 
EUR. J. INT’L L. 77, 84–86 (1997), http://www.ejil.org/pdfs/8/1/1426.pdf (describing how 
South Africa’s post-apartheid constitution reflects, and is interpreted in light of, international 
human rights law including both civil/political and socioeconomic rights guarantees).  See 
generally CHRISTOPH H. HEYNS & FRANS VILJOEN, THE IMPACT OF THE UNITED NATIONS 
HUMAN RIGHTS TREATIES ON THE DOMESTIC LEVEL (2002) (offering descriptive accounts of 
the extent to which international human rights law has been integrated into domestic legal 
practice in twenty selected countries, including South Africa). 
  14.  See JAMES NICKEL, MAKING SENSE OF HUMAN RIGHTS 4 (1987) (distinguishing  
2015]  THE RIGHT TO READ  11 
or “abstract rights” to refer to the grand principles inscribed in the in-
ternational human rights treaties and most national constitutions.  The 
right to freedom of expression is an example of a broad generic right.  
The right to read, on the other hand, should be understood as a more 
specific articulation or application of rights already recognized in in-
ternational law. 
Two examples will help to clarify this point about generic and 
specific rights.  American judges have interpreted the constitutional 
right to freedom of speech to require that a public school student may 
not be punished for wearing a political armband.15  In this example, 
freedom of expression is the generic right.  The right of minors to en-
gage in non-disruptive political advocacy while on school grounds is 
a specific right implied by the more generic one.  A second example 
can help to illustrate the point that generic and specific rights are not 
necessarily a neat dichotomy, but rather two poles on a spectrum that 
may have many intermediate points.  India’s constitution recognizes 
a right to life, which advocacy groups have used as the generic point 
of entry to secure judicial attention to the widespread problem of 
hunger.  Constitutional court decisions have subsequently vindicated 
a right to food, which frames school feedings and other hunger relief 
efforts as constitutional entitlements.16  In this example, the right to 
life sits at the highest level of abstraction.  The right to food occupies 
an intermediate status, and the right of children to be fed during the 
school day is the most specific right on this spectrum. 
This concept of a spectrum of rights ranging from the most 
general or abstract to the most specific is particularly helpful for 
placing the right to read in proper context.  The “right to read” is best 
understood as a specification of broader human rights principles en-
shrined in the UDHR and later binding covenants.17  These general 
 
Locke’s “generic rights” to life, liberty, and property and the Universal Declaration’s list of 
“specific rights,” including life, liberty, security of the person; freedom from discrimination; 
freedom  of  religion;  freedom  of  thought  and  expression;  freedom  of  assembly  and 
association; freedom from torture and cruel punishments; freedom from arbitrary arrest; the 
right to equality; to a fair trial; to protections of privacy; to freedom of movement; to marry 
and found a family; to freedom from forced marriage; to education; to the availability of a 
job; to unionize; to an adequate standard of living; to social security; to education; to health 
care; etc.); see also id. at 19–20 (suggesting that rights—a term here used more broadly than 
human rights to include, for example, contractual rights—may be conceptualized along a 
spectrum of specificity).

rights include:  freedom of expression, the right to education, chil-
dren’s media rights, minority rights, and the right to science and cul-
ture.  The effort to draw attention to and secure the right to read can 
therefore be analogized to recent efforts to claim and define the right 
to water,18 the right to a safe environment,19 and the right to credit.20  
Certainly, thoughtful people have objected to these initiatives’ use of 
the human rights framework and terminology.  Water, the environ-
ment, and credit are not addressed in the major human rights docu-
ments.  Some human rights advocates and theorists are concerned 
that expanding the list of human rights will dilute or undermine safe-
guards for truly fundamental norms.21  This potential objection to the 
recognition of a right to read will be discussed in Part III.  For now, it 
is important only to appreciate that it is possible—with ample prece-
dent—to argue for the existence of human rights that are not already 
enumerated in the major documents, without needing to revise the 
text of major international human rights documents to insert them. 
Drawing  on  established  principles  of  international  human 
rights law, therefore, it may be seen that implicit in these norms is a 
universal human right to read, and to do so in one’s preferred lan-
guage.  Some of the textually recognized human rights discussed be-
low—including freedom of expression and the right to education—

are  already  well  theorized.    Others—including  children’s  media 
rights, the right to science and culture, and minority rights—remain 
at  an  earlier  stage  of  theorization.    For  these  relatively  under-
theorized generic rights, the project of developing an understanding 
of the more specific right to read can also help to advance the larger 
project of theorizing the broader generic right.  Within this process, a 
specific focus on reading as a subset of educational and cultural is-
sues helps to narrow the task, providing one particular perspective or 
theme from which to approach and develop the normative content of 
the broader rights claims. 
A. The Right to Education 
The right to read is closely related to the right to education, 
which  was  first  recognized  at  the international level in the 1948 
UDHR.22  It was later given binding legal status through the 1966 
ICESCR.23  The right to education is further enshrined in the Con-
vention on the Rights of the Child (Children’s Convention).24  These 
three most noteworthy agreements are just the beginning of interna-
tional legal instruments recognizing and reinforcing the right to edu-
cation.25 
Internationally, the right to education is understood as imply-
ing both a negative claim against state interference with private edu-
cational efforts,26 and a positive claim on state resources and initia-
tives  to  make  education  accessible  to  all,  regardless  of  family 
income.27  The right to education has specifically been interpreted to 
include a minimum obligation on all countries, no matter their level 
of development or available resources, to achieve universal and free

primary education, including basic literacy.28  It also entails an obli-
gation on states to progressively make more advanced educational 
opportunities available to all without discrimination.29  The concept 
of progressive realization recognizes that implementing the right to 
education is an expensive task, and that states must do what they can 
with available resources, while aiming toward ever-greater expansion 
as their economies grow and their educational institutions gain expe-
rience and strength. 
The right to education has been described as an “empower-
ment right” in the sense that, although not necessary for basic human 
survival, it is an essential enabler of a wide range of other human 
rights.30  The U.N. Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural 
Rights has issued an authoritative interpretation of the right to educa-
tion, which begins by emphasizing its dual nature as having both in-
trinsic and utilitarian value: 
Education is both a human right in itself and an indis-
pensable means of realizing other human rights.  As 
an empowerment right, education is the primary vehi-
cle by which economically and socially marginalized 
adults and children can lift themselves out of poverty 
and  obtain  the  means  to  participate  fully  in  their 
communities . . . .  But the importance of education is 
not just practical:  a well-educated, enlightened and 
active mind, able to wander freely and widely, is one 
of the joys and rewards of human existence.31 
Under the various international treaties, the right to education 
is understood primarily in terms of formal education occurring within 
institutions.  The right is also understood as particularly, though not

exclusively, relevant to children and youth.  Yet the treaty language 
also points to a broader concept of lifelong education by prioritizing 
“the full development of the human personality” as the central aim of 
education.32  This is consistent with the general emphasis of human 
rights on the promotion of dignity and development as a touchstone 
concept.33  It is also consistent with the concept of education as an 
empowering force throughout a person’s life.  Education cannot fully 
serve these aims if it ends with childhood.  Ensuring opportunities for 
adults and children to read for continued learning beyond the class-
room can plausibly be understood as part of the right to education.  
This would, however, be an extension of the right to education con-
cept beyond its traditional use. 
Domestically,  the  United  States  differs  from  Europe  and 
many other countries by not recognizing education in its national 
constitution.  Many state constitutions, however, do specifically men-
tion education.  Typically this is done through language that empha-
sizes the state’s duty to provide for a system of free schooling.34  
Some state courts have interpreted these provisions to require state 
schools to meet minimum levels of adequacy for all students, while 
other state courts have treated this constitutional language as not re-
quiring any specific standard of delivery.35 
The right to education offers particularly strong support for 
the right to read as it relates to accessing textbooks and other explicit-
ly educational materials.  It would be a mistake, however, to cabin 
the right to read quite so narrowly.  Children’s literature plays an im-
portant role in literacy development, and one of the aims of education 
is to develop young peoples’ appetites to read for learning and for 
pleasure beyond the required curriculum.  Taking a more expansive 
view of education as continuing across the lifetime, nonfiction works 
geared to adults also have particular value.  Martha Nussbaum also

persuasively makes the case that fictional literature and especially 
novels have a unique role to play in the development of capacities for 
ethical judgment, empathy, and global citizenship.36  The academic 
scholarship whose production plays a central role in higher education 
can also be considered as an aspect that is closely grounded in the 
right to education. 
B. Children’s Media Rights 
The most specific support for the right to read may be found 
in the Children’s Convention.  The Children’s Convention is an ex-
ample of a more recent trend in international human rights treaty-
making, in which treaties focused on a particular group of rights-
bearers have been elaborated.  These have included, for example, 
conventions on the rights of women, indigenous groups, and disabled 
persons.  These treaties predominantly reiterate those rights previous-
ly recognized in the foundational human rights texts.  Yet they also 
advance some innovations, especially on themes of particular con-
cern to the specific group of rights-bearers.  Thus, the Children’s 
Convention contains provisions recognizing the rights of children to 
freedom of expression,37 to healthcare,38 and to education.39  It also 
has  several  provisions  that  do  not  have  direct  corollaries  in  the 
UDHR or the International Covenants, including the right of the dis-
abled child to special care,40 and the right to protection from domes-
tic violence.41 
One of these innovative provisions specifically addresses the 
availability of children’s literature and other children’s media.  Arti-
cle 17 commits States Parties to encourage the appropriate develop-
ment of mass media to support the developmental needs of all chil-
dren.42  The drafting origins of this Article help to explain its unique 
appearance in the Children’s Convention.  The earliest working draft 
had identified mass media as a potential source of “harmful influ-

ence” on the child’s “mental and moral development,” from which 
children must be protected.43  During the discussion, controversy 
arose over the tension between child protection and freedom of ex-
pression, and also the relative roles of parents and the state in achiev-
ing this protection.44  A few voices also called for the provision to be 
redrafted to emphasize the positive role of media rather than the po-
tential for harm.45  This suggestion prompted the dramatically differ-
ent language ultimately adopted, which emphasizes children’s rights 
of access to media rather than protection from it.46 
The format of Article 17 is also somewhat unconventional, in 
that it does not use the term “right” to articulate a normative claim to 
some liberty or entitlement.  Instead, the provision defines a corre-
sponding state duty.  States signing onto the Convention “shall en-
sure that the child has access to information and material from a di-
versity of national and international sources, especially those aimed 
at the promotion of his or her social, spiritual, and moral well-being 
and physical and mental health.”47  The provision also explicitly em-
phasizes the importance of international cooperation and providing 
media in minority and indigenous languages.48  At the time these de-
bates were taking place, “media” was understood to refer primarily to 
broadcast television, radio, and newspapers.49  At a late stage in the 
debate, however, specific language was inserted committing states to 
“[e]ncourage the production and distribution of children’s books,” at 
the suggestion of a non-profit organization, the International Board

This duty upon states to encourage the production and dis-
semination of children’s literature might be characterized as “rather 
weak in nature, considering the use of the term ‘encourage.’”51  The 
provision as a whole, however, embraces a “stronger obligation of 
States parties to ‘ensure that the child has access to’” information and 
cultural materials.52  The obligation “to ensure” could therefore re-
quire a state to intervene more directly where mere encouragement of 
private actors fails to produce the intended result.53  This emphasis 
distinguishes children’s media rights from freedom of expression; the 
media rights formulation uniquely emphasizes the state’s duty to en-
sure that adolescents and children have access to a diversity of mate-
rials to select from.54  The U.N. Committee on the Rights of the Child 
has since offered guidance recommending that states provide budget-
ary support for the production and dissemination of children’s books 
and other media.55  At least one commentator has interpreted the pro-
vision as making it possible for courts to identify an implied duty up-
on states to establish a plan for increasing the availability of chil-
dren’s media, and to make reasonable progress in implementing the 
plan, as well as “a duty to adopt laws, policies, and programs that 
will increase the availability of a diversity of mass media sources, 
whenever young people overall or certain segments of young people 
lack access.”56 
This duty-centric format is also found elsewhere within the 
Children’s  Convention.    For  example,  Article  11  defines  specific 
governmental duties to protect children from international abduction,

rather than using the language of a “right” to be free from such ab-
duction.57  Other provisions combine both “rights” language as well 
as the articulation of specific duties.  For example, Article 28 recog-
nizes “the right of the child to education” and then spells out specific 
governmental duties to provide for free and compulsory primary edu-
cation, to make secondary education accessible to all, and to expand 
access to higher education on the basis of capacity.  Article 17 might 
therefore be thought of as an articulation of specific state duties as a 
consequence of the Article 13 right to freedom of expression.58  Arti-
cle 17 may also be recognized as closely connected to the rights to 
cultural participation and minority identity that are articulated later in 
the document.59 
C. The Right to Science and Culture 
As discussed above, the right to education and children’s me-
dia rights provide the most direct support for a right to read as it per-
tains to materials for children and youth.  But a broader right to 
read—one that extends into adulthood and encompasses reading for 
pleasure as well as for education—can find support in the right to 
science and culture, which has been the focus of much of my prior 
scholarship. 
According to Article 27 of the 1948 UDHR, “Everyone has 
the right freely to participate in the cultural life of the community, to 
enjoy the arts and to share in scientific advancement and its benefits.”  
This provision later found expression in the two Covenants, each 
emphasizing a different aspect.  The International Covenant on Civil 
and  Political  Rights  (ICCPR)  emphasizes  respect  for  the  cultural 
rights of minority groups.60  This concept is often referred to simply 
as “cultural rights,” although the phrase “minority cultural rights” is 
preferable, to avoid confusion with the broader concept of cultural 
rights.  Minority cultural rights are particularly relevant to thinking 
about how language interacts with the right to read—this will be the 
focus of the following section.  Parallel to the ICCPR, the ICESCR 
emphasizes equitable access to culture and technology, broad partici-

pation in cultural creativity, protection of authorship, and internation-
al cultural and scientific cooperation.61  This lengthy provision within 
the ICESCR is increasingly shorthanded as “the right to science and 
culture.”62  This section focuses on the right to science and culture as 
enshrined in the ICESCR; the following section returns to minority 
cultural rights as found in the ICCPR. 
The right to science and culture is commonly broken down in-
to three components:  the right to cultural participation, the right to 
science and technology, and the right to protection of authorship.63  
The right to cultural participation relates to the ability of every per-
son both to access cultural goods and to take part in cultural mean-
ing-making as a creator.  The right to science and technology has 
been interpreted to include a right of access to scientific literature and 
texts.64  Finally, protection of authorship calls for regard to the inter-
ests of creators through copyright and other means, in tandem with 
the principle of expanding access for all.65  In short, the right to sci-
ence and culture must be understood as a call on governments to cre-
ate conditions that empower everyone to enjoy and to create cultural 
works, including books, ebooks, and other reading material.66 
The right to science and culture lays the foundation for a par-
ticularly broad understanding of the right to read.  Whereas the right 
to education was primarily focused on the setting of formal educa-
tion, and children’s media rights emphasize access to books during 
childhood, the right to science and culture points to a life-long right 
to continue to learn and to develop the human personality through in-
teraction with texts, among other cultural works.  Thus the right to 
read requires access not only to explicitly educational materials, chil-
dren’s literature, scientific literature, and other non-fiction works.  It 
extends equally to novels, poetry, memoirs, and to both “high” and

“low” fictions—the full variety of ways that people give expression 
to and engage with culture.  The right to science and culture also un-
derscores the human rights value of participation, both as a creator 
and as a consumer.  Thus, “the right to read” must be understood to 
imply also a “right to write.”  These two aspects of the right to read 
go hand in hand. 
D. Minority Cultural Rights 
Whereas the right to science and culture assures the right of 
everyone to participate in cultural life, minority cultural rights em-
phasize the need to specially protect the cultural expressions of polit-
ically or socially vulnerable groups.  This has particular importance 
for thinking about the right to read as it intersects with challenges of 
racial or social inequality and linguistic justice.  Article 27 of the 
ICCPR states:  “In those States in which ethnic, religious or linguistic 
minorities exist, persons belonging to such minorities shall not be 
denied  the  right,  in  community  with  the  other  members  of  their 
group, to enjoy their own culture, to profess and practise their own 
religion, or to use their own language.”67  Whereas some provisions 
of international human rights law pertain specifically to indigenous 
groups, here the term “minority” is much broader, encompassing any 
cultural group that cannot count on numerical dominance to protect 
its interests in cultural integrity, promotion, and development.68 
Of particular importance to understanding the scope of minor-
ity cultural rights is to determine whether they entail a purely nega-
tive claim to freedom from oppressive state action, or also a positive 
claim on state resources and initiatives to promote minority lan-
guages and culture.  Put more concretely, minority cultural rights 
would clearly be violated by a state ban on publishing in minority 
languages.  Apart from not maliciously interfering with minority cul-
tural expressions, though, must states do anything more proactive to 
promote minority rights?  The U.N. Human Rights Committee has 
encouraged that this question be answered with a “yes,” interpreting 
the ICCPR text as not only permitting, but in fact requiring, the use

of “positive measures of protection.”69  The Committee’s guidance 
does  not,  however,  specify  exactly  what  these  positive  measures 
might include, beyond clarifying that corrective measures used to fa-
vor minority groups should not be understood as violating the human 
rights obligation of nondiscrimination.70 
For  example,  do  minority  cultural  rights—in  combination 
with the right to education—imply a right to be educated in one’s na-
tive language?  This is a difficult question to answer conclusively at 
the present time.  Neither the UDHR nor the ICESCR specifically 
discuss language as an aspect of education.  Both instruments, how-
ever, expressly forbid discrimination based on language or social 
origin with respect to any of the enumerated rights, including the 
right to education.71  In more recent documents, however, the role of 
language in the right to education has received more specific atten-
tion.  The Children’s Convention includes both this general prohibi-
tion on discrimination, as well as an emphasis on “the development 
of respect for the child’s own cultural identity, language, and values” 
as one of the aims of education.72  A 1968 judgment of the European 
Court of Human Rights (ECHR) held explicitly that the right to edu-
cation did not imply a right to be educated in any particular lan-
guage.73  Yet the ECHR modified this view in a more recent case in-
volving  the  education  of  children  of  Greek  heritage  in  northern 
Cyprus, holding that it was not reasonable to restrict public educa-
tional options only to Turkish.74  It may be fair to say that the minori-
ty cultural rights aspect of the right to education is not yet firmly rec-
ognized, but this intersection is likely to receive increasing emphasis

2015]  THE RIGHT TO READ  23 
in the future.75 
The right of a minority group to use its own language might 
be grounded in two different types of considerations.  The first em-
phasizes necessity.  If a person is not permitted and empowered to 
read books in their native language, they may be unable to read 
books at all, or at least not as well.  If books are of limited availabil-
ity in a particular language, members of that linguistic group will suf-
fer from systemic disadvantage.  The second approach emphasizes 
the significance of linguistic choice.  Even when an individual is ca-
pable of speaking or reading in a second language, they may perceive 
a unique value in doing so in the native language of their cultural 
group.  Thus, French-speaking Canadians would not see the wide 
availability of literature in English as a reason to discount the im-
portance of the access to literature in French.  The choice to read and 
write in the language of a particular culture is itself an act of cultural 
expression.  The ability of members of a cultural group to communi-
cate, tell stories, and exchange ideas with each other in print is an 
important vehicle to ensure the “enjoy[ment of] their own culture.”  
This strongly suggests that the right to read should be understood not 
merely as the right to read in some language, but as the right to read 
in the language the individual chooses.  Educating all students in a 
global language is surely a valuable means of promoting the right to 
read, but it cannot be considered as a substitute for promoting access 
to literature in local languages as well. 
E. Freedom of Expression 
According to Article 19 of the UDHR, “Everyone has the 
right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes free-
dom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and 
impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of 
frontiers.”76  The ICCPR reiterates this language, adding for empha-
sis that the right extends to “information and ideas of all kinds . . . ei-
ther orally, in writing or in print, in the form of art, or through any 
other media of his choice.”77  Thus, while freedom of expression is

recognition,  within  the  framework  of  the  right  to  education  and  the  right  to 
nondiscrimination, of a right to instruction in the language spoken by a child’s ethnic group, 
noting signs of a trend in that direction, and discussing opposing scholarly viewpoints).  One 
factor favoring recognition of a linguistic aspect to the right to education is the related 
protection for language rights found elsewhere in human rights law, as discussed infra.

24  COLUMBIA JOURNAL OF TRANSNATIONAL LAW  [54:1 
often thought to concern primarily “political” expression, the lan-
guage of the human rights documents is explicitly broader in scope, 
and plainly includes all forms of reading material on any subject. 
U.S. courts have interpreted the constitutional right to free-
dom of expression as imposing only a negative duty upon the state to 
refrain from penalizing or limiting expression and not as imposing 
any positive duty upon the state to support or encourage media access 
and diversity.  Internationally, however, the conception of freedom of 
expression goes beyond these limits, to include positive duties.  Thus 
the U.N. Human Rights Committee has emphasized in interpreting 
Article 19 that “States parties should take particular care to encour-
age” an independent and diverse media, including media accessible 
to linguistic minorities.78  The same document urges states to “take 
all necessary steps” to ensure individual access to Internet-based me-
dia, and to support public broadcasting in a way that preserves edito-
rial independence.79  Thus, the human right to freedom of expression 
implies some level of state duty to encourage or fund media beyond 
market mechanisms, ensuring that all people enjoy access. 
U.S. academics, too, have not hesitated to argue that the free-
dom of expression principle can be applied more broadly than current 
case law recognizes.  Jack Balkin proposes that free speech theory 
and practice should aim at realizing the goal of democratic culture—
in which all individuals, not just media elites and professional crea-
tors, enjoy meaningful opportunities to shape the cultural life of the 
community.80  This in turn implies that interactivity, mass participa-
tion, and the ability to build upon and modify existing cultural works 
are themselves free speech values.81  Neil Netanel emphasizes the ex-
istence of a vibrant media sphere as critical to the freedom of expres-
sion and democratic self-governance.82  Molly Van Houweling notes 
both a U.S. commitment to the principle that freedom of speech is 
equally and freely available to all, and a line of American policies 
that aim at a more equal distribution of opportunities to exercise this

A full discussion of the theoretical foundations and implica-
tions of freedom of expression is well beyond the scope of this arti-
cle.  My more modest aim is simply to offer the briefest sketch of 
some of the depth and diversity of this principle, as a touchstone for 
thinking about the right to read.  Viewed narrowly, the right level of 
free expression would pertain primarily to the liberty dimension of 
the right to read.  Yet a fuller conception of freedom of expression—
which finds support both in scholarship and in international law—
suggests a broader approach to the right to read, which includes the 
capacity and availability dimensions.  The purposes of freedom of 
expression are most fully realized when all members of society are 
empowered to read regularly, and when authors are able to reach the 
widest possible audience.  The next part of this article explores the 
conditions for realizing this goal. 
II. THREE DIMENSIONS OF THE RIGHT TO READ 
As detailed above, implicit in the existing principles of inter-
national human rights law is a “right to read,” which lies at the inter-
section of the rights to education, children’s media, science and cul-
ture,  minority  cultural  rights,  and  freedom  of  expression.    By 
highlighting the multiple bases of the right to read and further elabo-
rating its content, we can clarify the scope of government duties im-
plied by it.  The right to read is best understood in terms of three di-
mensions:  liberty (the freedom to read and write), capacity (the 
ability to read and write), and availability (effective access to reading 
materials and platforms for communicating with others through writ-
ing).  Although the liberty and capacity dimensions of the right are 
widely  recognized  and  respected—both  normatively  and  in  prac-
tice—the availability dimension remains today as the greatest barrier 
to wider enjoyment of the right to read. 
First, the liberty dimension:  governments must respect the 
freedom to read, including the freedom to read the content of the 
reader’s choice, in the language of the reader’s choice.  The liberty to 
read would be violated, for example, by government actions of cen-

26  COLUMBIA JOURNAL OF TRANSNATIONAL LAW  [54:1 
sorship, including the banning of publication or education in minority 
languages.  Second is the capacity dimension of the right.  Human 
rights law requires governments not only to refrain from actions im-
peding enjoyment of human rights, but also to take positive steps to 
ensure their enjoyment.  In the area of the right to read, governments 
have a duty to promote the capacity to read by assuring that everyone 
has opportunities to learn the skills of literacy, both as a reader and a 
writer.  Again, the capacity to read is only useful if it is provided in a 
language the individual understands well, which will generally be 
their native language.  Third and finally, I highlight the availability 
dimension of the right.  Even when liberty and capacity are realized, 
the right to read will remain a useless illusion unless reading material 
is actually available to all readers.  The availability dimension in-
volves consideration of geographic accessibility, affordability, and 
acceptability, including considerations of language. 
A. The Liberty to Read 
The liberty dimension of the right to read refers to the free-
dom to read and write in one’s preferred language.  Although I have 
placed the liberty dimension first among these three, I do not wish to 
imply that it is more important than capacity or availability.  All 
three dimensions of the right to read are equally essential to effective 
enjoyment of the right.  If anything, the dimension of availability, 
which I will discuss last, deserves prioritization, if only because it 
happens to be where the greatest problems exist today.  Nevertheless, 
it makes some logical sense to begin with liberty because this dimen-
sion of the right to read has the longest tradition of recognition.  The 
liberty to read, closely related to freedom of expression, fits neatly in 
the “first-generation” tradition of civil and political rights, with nor-
mative roots extending back for more than a century.85 
The liberty dimension of the right to read is violated when 
governments interfere with citizens’ reading choices through censor-
ship.  The OpenNet Initiative reports that several countries engage in 
 
  85.  See generally Burns H. Weston, Human Rights:  Concept and Content, in HUMAN 
RIGHTS IN THE WORLD COMMUNITY:  ISSUES AND ACTION 17, 21–23 (Richard Pierre Claude & 
Burns H. Weston eds., 3d ed. 2006) (detailing the traditional understanding of human rights 
guarantees  as  falling  into  first-generation,  second-generation,  and  third-generation 
approaches); see also CASS R. SUNSTEIN, THE SECOND BILL OF RIGHTS:  FDR’S UNFINISHED 
REVOLUTION AND WHY WE NEED IT MORE THAN EVER (2004) (contrasting the acceptance of 
second-generation rights in much of the world with the failure to incorporate them into the 
American constitutional order, notwithstanding support and leadership from the Roosevelt 
Administration leading up to the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights).

“pervasive” efforts of Internet filtering to block access to political 
views of which they disapprove, including China, Ethiopia, Iran, Syr-
ia, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Vietnam.86  Similarly, Freedom 
House reports that at least twenty-nine governments engage in efforts 
to “block access to information related to politics, social issues, and 
human rights,” and suggests that this and other forms of political cen-
sorship are on the rise.87  Government censorship continues to be a 
common violation of the right to read.  Less obviously, the liberty to 
read may also be threatened by governmental or private data collec-
tion efforts that interfere with “the right to read anonymously.”88 
The liberty dimension of the right to read is also at issue when 
a country’s dominant ethnic group seeks to force its own language 
upon minority groups.  For instance, in 1935 the Permanent Court of 
International Justice (PCIJ) held that Albania had violated the rights 
of the Greek-Albanian minority when it banned the operation of pri-
vate schools.89  Although facially neutral as to the ethnic composition 
of such schools, the practical impact of the ban was to restrict the 
ability of the Greek minority community to educate its children in the 
Greek language.  The PCIJ accordingly held that Albania’s actions 
violated international legal guarantees of effective equality, not mere-
ly formal equality, for the Greek minority group.90  Similarly, the 
U.S. Supreme Court in 1923 struck down state laws that forbade the 
teaching of German in public schools, emphasizing fundamental lib-

erties.91  More recently, in the 1970s, South Africa’s apartheid gov-
ernment, motivated by white-supremacist ideology, mandated Afri-
kaans as a language of instruction in black schools.92  The mandate is 
widely identified by South African historians as one of the catalysts 
for the 1976 Soweto uprising, a turning point in the South African 
struggle for black liberation.93  The Albanian ban on Greek-language 
education, American laws restricting the teaching of German, and the 
South African imposition of Afrikaans can all be understood as viola-
tions of the basic liberty dimension of the right to read and learn in 
one’s preferred language.  These governments attempted to impose 
the language of the politically dominant ethnic group as the “appro-
priate” language for instruction, in disregard for the preferences of 
the communities at issue. 
Apart from the educational context, other attacks on publish-
ing and reading in minority languages have also occurred.  In the 
1940s and 1950s, newly independent Pakistan was sharply divided 
over issues of linguistic policy.  National leaders sought to promote 
Urdu as the sole national language, in line with ideas about Muslim 
national identity.94  Members of the Bengali language community 
maintained that the official and educational use of their language, in-
cluding its traditional script, was nonnegotiable.95  The issue is cred-
ited as sparking the freedom movement that eventually achieved the 
independence of Bangladesh.96  International Mother Language Day

relied on substantive due process protections against unjustified regulation of economic 
activity, while referring to fundamental individual rights—including to direct the education 
of one’s children—only in dicta.  See William G. Ross, The Contemporary Significance of

of the Bengali Language Movement protests.  More recently, the 
U.N. Human Rights Committee acted upon a complaint regarding 
minority-language publishing in Uzbekistan.97  The Committee em-
phasized that the government’s refusal to renew the publishing li-
cense to a Tajik-language periodical violated both the right of free-
dom of expression and minority cultural rights.  According to the 
Committee’s opinion, both authors and readers had standing as vic-
tims of the human rights violation.98 
Violations of human rights are often conceived of as being di-
rected at or experienced by particular individuals.  Yet when a gov-
ernment seeks to limit reading and writing to a particular language, 
the liberty violation is experienced by an entire ethnic community.  
The restriction impacts a larger communal interest in the preservation 
of the minority community’s cultural vibrancy and its opportunities 
within the larger society.  There is thus an inescapable “group” aspect 
involved in the liberty to read.  Even in the context of more conven-
tional examples of censorship, such as government bans on particular 
books, a broad community of would-be readers is harmed by the lib-
erty violation.  This reflects the inherently communal nature of com-
munication.  Reading may take place in a private setting, one indi-
vidual at a time.  But it is at heart a mechanism for social interaction 
and the building of communities.  The freedom to distribute reading 
material is much like the freedom to peaceably assemble—both are 
means to the ends of group communication, the exchange of ideas, 
and public advocacy.  Government attempts to suppress such activity 
in particular languages often reflect anxieties about cultural and polit-
ical challenges from subordinated ethnic groups. 
Notably, the linguistically targeted violations of the liberty 
dimension of the right to read discussed above were widely con-
demned in their own time and continue to shock the conscience to-
day.  They are often motivated and justified by ideologies of ethnic 
supremacy, in which a majority group deliberately sets out to force a 
minority group to participate in cultural life only on the linguistic ter-
rain of the majority.  Similarly, state practices of Internet filtering 
and other forms of censorship are also widely condemned.  These 
forms of state action against the right to read are easy to recognize 
and condemn as a violation of human rights.  Yet the right to read

can be affected just as dramatically by state interventions of a less 
malicious nature, such as a failure to provide adequate educational 
opportunities to all. 
B. The Capacity to Read 
The liberty dimension alone does not go very far to ensure en-
joyment of the right to read.  The freedom to read and write is mean-
ingless to any given individual unless he or she also possesses the 
practical ability to exercise that freedom.  This ability—literacy—
must be acquired through a lengthy learning process.  This is the ca-
pacity dimension of the right to read, which imposes upon govern-
ments a duty to ensure that all people within their territory enjoy the 
educational opportunities necessary to acquire literacy.  According to 
the U.N. Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization: 
Literacy is the ability to identify, understand, interpret, 
create,  communicate,  [and]  compute,  using  printed 
and  written  materials  associated  with  varying  con-
texts.  Literacy involves a continuum of learning in 
enabling individuals to achieve their goals, to develop 
their knowledge and potential, and to participate fully 
in their community and wider society.99 
The notion of literacy as a human right is not a unique one.  
Kofi Annan made this claim many years ago, emphasizing the in-
strumental importance of literacy to other goals and values: 
Literacy is a bridge from misery to hope.  It is a tool 
for  daily  life  in  modern  society.    It  is  a  bulwark 
against poverty, and a building block of development, 
an  essential  complement  to  investments  in  roads, 
dams, clinics and factories. 
Literacy is a platform for democratization, and a vehi-
cle for the promotion of cultural and national identity.  
Especially for girls and women, it is an agent of fami-
ly health and nutrition.  For everyone, everywhere, lit-
eracy is, along with education in general, a basic hu-
man right.100

2015]  THE RIGHT TO READ  31 
Whereas the liberty dimension of the right to read is violated 
by state action restrictive of freedom, the capacity dimension is typi-
cally violated by state inaction—the failure of governments to effec-
tively fund and organize literacy instruction.  The liberty and capaci-
ty  dimensions  may  therefore  be  thought  of  as  mapping  onto  the 
common categorization of human rights into “first generation” rights 
or civil liberties that impose primarily negative state obligations ver-
sus “second generation” rights or social entitlements that impose pos-
itive state duties.101  Second-generation human rights, however, re-
main less widely accepted.  The E.U. Charter of Fundamental Rights 
includes only the right to education, with no mention of the right to 
science  and  culture  or  children’s  media  rights.102    In  the  United 
States, the ICESCR has yet to be ratified, and the U.S. Constitution 
contains no reference even to education.  Many state constitutions 
within the United States explicitly mandate the state government to 
provide for a system of public schools, although this is generally 
phrased as a state duty rather than as an individual right. 
Historically, the federal obligation of nondiscrimination has 
been an avenue for advocates to defend the right to education for lit-
eracy.  In the 1982 case of Plyler v. Doe, the U.S. Supreme Court 
struck down a Texas law withholding funds for the education of un-
documented immigrant children; the Court determined that the re-
striction on educational opportunity violated the right to equal protec-
tion.103    Although  declining  to  characterize  education  as  a 
“fundamental right,” the opinion emphasized its special importance 
to individuals and society at large,104 and highlighted achievement of 
literacy as its most valuable outcome: 
Illiteracy is an enduring disability.  The inability to 
read and write will handicap the individual deprived 
of a basic education each and every day of his life.  
The inestimable toll of that deprivation on the social, 
economic, intellectual, and psychological wellbeing of 
the individual, and the obstacle it poses to individual 
achievement, make it most difficult to reconcile the 
cost or the principle of a status-based denial of basic 
education with the framework of equality embodied in

Thus, even without explicitly recognizing a right to read, the Court 
found a way to defend the capacity dimension in the context of dis-
crimination against a minority group.106 
Like many rights, of course, the right to education for literacy 
may be recognized in principle yet still unfulfilled in practice.  In 
2012, the American Civil Liberties Union brought a class action law-
suit against the administrators of the Highland Park School District, 
located in one of America’s most blighted urban communities.107  
The complaint alleged that the school district was systematically fail-
ing to teach its students to read, despite a state constitutional obliga-
tion to provide for public education and a state statute requiring that 
students who do not demonstrate proficiency in reading appropriate 
to their grade levels be given “special assistance reasonably expected 
to enable the pupil to bring his or her reading skills to grade level 
within twelve months.”108  In initial proceedings, a judge found that 
the allegations had legal merit and scheduled a trial to afford the 
plaintiffs an opportunity to prove the underlying factual claims.109  At 
that point, however, Michigan’s appellate court took the case on re-
view.  There, two judges concluded that the constitutional and statu-
tory requirements of educational adequacy were in fact not enforcea-
ble by the courts, emphasizing that judges were particularly ill-suited 
to intervene in educational matters.110  The third judge dissented, ar-

area of particular importance to the child plaintiffs.111 
The Michigan case reflects the difficulties inherent in judicial 
enforcement of “positive” rights claims, which require government 
action, coordination, and resource allocation.  Education for literacy 
is easily recognized as a virtuous goal for public policy.  Yet charac-
terizing it as a legal right raises additional questions.  Who should re-
tain the authority to decide upon the specific measures to achieve this 
goal:  classroom  teachers,  school  administrators,  elected  school 
boards, state legislatures, or the federal government?  At what point 
should a court be empowered to find that the responsible party has 
been derelict in executing its duties?  When this occurs, what is the 
appropriate legal remedy:  an award of compensatory damages ulti-
mately paid for by taxpayers, a structural injunction creating court 
oversight of educational delivery, a consent decree negotiated be-
tween the plaintiffs and the local school district, or a mere declaration 
that legal rights are being violated without further relief?  These 
questions are difficult, but not impossible to answer, as demonstrated 
by decisions in which other states’ courts have acted upon the right to 
education.112 
Despite  extremely  limited  resources,  developing  countries 
have also accepted the goal of universal literacy and the responsibil-
ity of the state to achieve it.  Between 1970 and 1995, the adult illit-
eracy rate in developing countries was reduced from fifty-seven per-
cent  to  thirty  percent.113    More  recently,  the  Millennium 
Development Goals identified universal participation in primary edu-
cation as a target for 2015, focusing on rates of youth and adult liter-
acy as an important indicator.  As a result of widespread efforts, the 
global adult literacy rate increased from seventy-six percent in 1990 
to eighty-four percent in 2012.114  Yet 781 million people over the 
age of fifteen still lack basic reading and writing skills.115  There is a

significant gender dimension to this problem; sixty percent of the il-
literate population is female.116  Moreover, the criterion of “basic” 
literacy falls well short of the fuller definition of literacy as the abil-
ity to access, process, and communicate written information across a 
variety of contexts.  Clearly, more work remains to make this dimen-
sion of the right to read a reality for all people. 
C. Availability of Reading Material 
Beyond liberty and capacity, there remains a third dimension 
of the right to read, which is much less clearly established, yet just as 
necessary.  This is the issue of access to reading materials, or the 
availability dimension of the right to read.  The freedom and ability 
to read become truly meaningful only when the individual also has 
access to reading material.  To be sure, even in the absence of any 
sort of literature, basic literacy has significant value.  Basic literacy 
can enable one to read signs and product labels, to complete forms 
necessary to access government services, to write a shopping list, and 
to communicate with others through a note or text message.  But the 
greatest value of literacy is the door it unlocks to the world of printed 
literature:  the ability to read widely both for knowledge and for 
pleasure.  Although the liberty and capacity dimensions of the right 
to read are well established in theory and increasingly realized in 
practice, the availability dimension is the most neglected both in the-
ory and in practice. 
Readers from the United States and other industrialized coun-
tries, particularly those connected to universities as scholars or stu-
dents, may be tempted to take access to reading materials for granted.  
Through our world-class libraries, we enjoy an embarrassment of 
riches.  Yet accessing books is a well-recognized challenge in re-
source-poor countries, where book prices are typically higher than in 
the United States, despite lower local incomes.  The availability prob-
lem is most acute for certain groups within developing countries.  In 
many languages, there is simply very little to read, and the scope and 
diversity of the supply is inadequate at any price.  For the poor, pric-
es of books in the legitimate marketplace are often prohibitive; access 
must come through government, charitable, or black-market means, 
if at all. 
Jurists elaborating the human rights to education, health care, 
and food have defined several dimensions of availability, which can 
also be usefully adapted to the right to read.  Interpretative guidance 
 
  116.  Id. at 18.  
2015]  THE RIGHT TO READ  35 
has emphasized the “4A” framework for evaluating access to educa-
tion:  educational facilities and programming must be (1) available in 
sufficient quantity, (2) accessible to all regardless of income or other 
dimensions of social vulnerability, (3) acceptable in terms of cultural 
relevance and quality, and (4) adaptable to diverse and changing 
needs of different populations and across time.117  In the context of 
access to health care, a similar framework has been articulated as 
consisting of the 3AQ dimensions of access.  Health care facilities, 
goods, and services must similarly be available in sufficient quantity; 
they must be economically and physically accessible to all, particu-
larly to vulnerable populations; they must be culturally acceptable 
and consistent with medical ethics; and they must be of good quali-
ty.118  The right to food has also been elaborated through a similar 
framework, emphasizing “the availability of food in a quantity and 
quality sufficient to satisfy the dietary needs of individuals, free from 
adverse substances, and acceptable within a given culture.”119 
One way to generalize these three frameworks for thinking 
about education, food, and healthcare as human rights is that they all 
ask three basic questions:  (1) Is there enough to go around? (2) Is 
everyone able to access the supply or are vulnerable populations ex-
cluded? (3) Is the supply of appropriate quality—both as judged by 
objective measures and from the subjective perspective of the right-
bearers?  These same questions of adequacy, accessibility, and ac-
ceptability can be posed for the supply of reading materials to elabo-
rate the availability dimension of the right to read. 
1. Adequacy:  Is There Enough? 
On the first issue of adequacy, it quickly becomes apparent 
that the situation differs tremendously from country to country.  This 
is true both in terms of the number of unique titles and the total num-
ber of copies in circulation.  For example, the German publishing in-
dustry produces 93,600 new titles and re-editions each year, while

Pakistan’s publishing industry produces only 3,500.120  The U.K. 
publishing industry produces approximately six books per British 
child each year; the Indian publishing industry produces one book for 
every twenty Indian children.121  In many very poor countries, there 
is a shockingly inadequate supply of reading material available for 
purchase.  When people have spoken of Africa’s “book famine,” they 
typically have had in mind this basic criterion.  There is simply very 
little material in circulation, which makes it very difficult for even 
people of means to purchase materials to meet their basic reading 
needs.  Bookstores and libraries are few and far between, and plainly 
inadequate to serve the needs of most of the population.  Many, per-
haps even most, titles are simply impossible to obtain at any price. 
At the other end of the spectrum, however, there are book-
wealthy countries where the basic dimension of supply is hardly an 
issue.  In the United States, for example, bookstores and libraries are 
plentiful.  The second-hand market does a heavy trade in used books 
through for-profit marketplaces, charity shops, and private sales.  An 
average person may own dozens of books and can relatively easily 
borrow as many as they have time and interest to read from a public 
library.  In college neighborhoods, it is not unusual at the end of a 
school year to see boxes of gently used books placed out upon the 
sidewalk with a scribbled note:  “FREE.”  Book-wealthy countries 
are also likely to have the greatest degree of Internet connectivity, 
enabling their residents to access a host of other reading material. 
In between these two extremes of book famine and book plen-
ty, the picture of availability is more nuanced in a third set of coun-
tries.  In South Africa and India, for instance, the situation of availa-
bility might be assessed as fairly good, judged from the perspective 
of affluent, English-speaking urbanites.  Yet once we make the shift 
to consider nuances of language and income, problems become more 
apparent. 
2. Accessibility:  Does Everyone Have Access? 
The second dimension of accessibility adopts this more nu-
anced perspective, considering questions of affordability, diversity, 
and exclusion.  This dimension asks whether it can truly be said that

all people enjoy access to the available resources, or whether certain 
populations are systematically left out.122  Judged on this dimension, 
many countries have severe problems with respect to access to read-
ing material.  Books are frequently expensive, and in the context of 
extreme income inequality, many people will not be able to meet 
their  reading  needs  through  private  purchases.    Access  for  these 
groups may depend significantly on government and charitable ef-
forts, such as providing school textbooks free of charge and main-
taining a system of libraries.  Efforts to drive down the cost of books 
in the marketplace would also be relevant here, enabling a greater 
proportion of the population to meet their book needs without direct 
assistance.  This article has also highlighted the role of linguistic 
group membership as a social status that shapes access to books.  In 
many national contexts, the available books are accessible only to 
readers fluent in an internationally dominant language, and not to 
speakers of local languages who have not mastered the language of 
wider communication. 
Wealth and language are not the only dimensions along which 
barriers to accessibility are experienced.  Another dimension of book 
accessibility  concerns  readers  who  are  blind  or  otherwise  print-
disabled.  This group faces unique barriers in accessing reading mate-
rial, which must be specially addressed, both legally and technologi-
cally.123  The United States has long had a legal framework to facili-
tate the provision of books in accessible formats on a nonprofit basis. 
This effort received an international boost when the World Intellec-
tual Property Organization (WIPO) concluded negotiations on the 
Marrakesh Treaty, designed to facilitate cross-border access to such 
works through targeted exceptions to the general copyright regime.124  
Within this legal framework, nonprofit groups have worked to devel-
op special technologies to facilitate the conversion of books into for-
mats accessible to the blind. 
Children may also be thought of as a special population that is 
particularly likely to face accessibility barriers.  Children generally 
do not command economic resources to purchase books in the mar-

ketplace, and the majority of books produced for the mainstream 
market will not be appropriate to their reading levels and interests.  
School libraries, free textbook provision, and charitable initiatives 
play a particularly crucial role in providing a market demand for the 
production of children’s literature and in ensuring that this literature 
is accessible to children across the socioeconomic spectrum.  Yet 
these social initiatives are not yet adequate in many countries and re-
gions. 
To summarize, the accessibility dimension is often a problem 
for books with respect to inequalities of income, language, disability, 
and age.  Whether we are speaking in the context of education, health 
care, food, or reading material, the dimension of accessibility does 
not necessarily require that the goods and services be provided for 
free to all.  Across all these contexts, market-oriented and fee-based 
provision is typically an important part of the delivery system.  The 
insistence on characterizing these goods and services as a universal 
human right recognizes, however, that some degree of subsidized and 
free-to-the-recipient provision will be necessary to serve certain seg-
ments of the population.  Where the market fails to extend services, 
public policy solutions must be found; where an individual or family 
cannot afford to make payment, those solutions must be provided 
without charge to the beneficiary.  Other policy measures can also 
play a role in addressing barriers to access experienced by special 
populations. 
3. Acceptability:  What Kinds of Material? 
The third dimension of acceptability looks at the quality of 
the supply:  are the books that are available and accessible to the 
population of an acceptable quality?  In the context of human rights, 
acceptability is usually judged as having both an objective and sub-
jective dimension.  For example, health care services may be objec-
tively judged as high quality according to standards set by experts, 
based on scientific research.125  Yet even in the context of medicine, 
the human rights framework also emphasizes the relevance of quality 
as judged by patients themselves.  The services must be “respectful 
of the culture of individuals, minorities, peoples and communities, 
sensitive to gender and life-cycle requirements, as well as being de-
signed to respect confidentiality . . . .”126  Similarly, in the context of 
the right to food, a food supply may be unacceptable according to ob-
 
  125.  See General Comment 14, supra note 118, ¶ 12(d). 
  126.  See id. ¶ 12(c).  
2015]  THE RIGHT TO READ  39 
jective criteria if it is lacking in nutrition or containing contami-
nants.127  But the human rights framework also requires subjective 
acceptability; the food must be culturally appropriate and take into 
account the values that people attach to food and eating.128  The sup-
ply of available reading material, like health care services and food, 
should also meet both objective and subjective standards. 
In the context of the right to read, the subjective dimension is 
particularly important.  Medical care and nutrition both have a very 
strong objective dimension.  It is objectively verifiable that certain 
“poor quality” types of food or health interventions will cause injury 
or death.  In the context of reading material, however, quality is a 
more subjective judgment.  Certainly, some fiction is better than oth-
ers.  Yet when two individuals disagree on the quality of a novel, sci-
entific inquiry cannot resolve their dispute.  Where nonfiction works 
are concerned, subject matter experts are more likely to converge on 
their judgment of a particular book as high or low quality.  But even 
here, a subjective element will remain.  For some readers, a library 
containing only practical how-to books would be acceptable.  For 
other readers, it would be vital that the book supply offer entertaining 
works, or spiritually uplifting works, or works that explore history.  
The subjective dimension of cultural relevance will also be particu-
larly important for books, because they are fundamentally cultural 
goods.  Interests, tastes, and information needs vary by community.  
In one social context, books on website design will be highly rele-
vant; in another context, readers may be more concerned with how to 
repair a bicycle or build an earthquake-proof home.  A novel about a 
suburban housewife in the United States will have great appeal for 
some populations and little appeal for others.  There is a particular 
need for people to have access to literature that reflects their own cul-
tural contexts.  Similarly, children will require different types of ma-
terial than are desirable to adults. 
In the context of the right to read, quality concerns are best 
addressed by simply expanding the variety of material that is availa-
ble and allowing readers to make their own choices.  The right to 
read  in  no  way  suggests  that  “low-quality”  materials  should  be 
purged or discouraged.  Indeed, to restrict access to such materials on 
the grounds of quality control would violate the liberty dimension of 
the right, which emphasizes that individuals should be free to read 
what they choose.  Rather, meeting the criteria of acceptability means 
that the selection of books must be large and diverse enough to serve 
diverse readers’ interests.  Where book markets are working well, we 
 
  127.  See General Comment 12, supra note 119, ¶¶ 8–10. 
  128.  See id. ¶¶ 8, 11.  
40  COLUMBIA JOURNAL OF TRANSNATIONAL LAW  [54:1 
may expect book producers to respond to the diversity of reader in-
terests, generating sufficient high-quality offerings without govern-
ment intervention.  The challenge in these contexts is merely to en-
sure that everyone enjoys access to the supply.  Where book markets 
are not working well—where very few titles are being produced, or 
where the market is largely ignoring certain linguistic and cultural 
groups—acceptability of the supply will be a much greater concern.  
In particular, a supply consisting overwhelmingly of imported books, 
or very old books that are no longer under copyright, is unlikely to be 
acceptable.  The supply must include locally produced, culturally rel-
evant, timely works.  In short, books must be available that people 
actually want to read. 
In line with the subjective dimension of acceptability and the 
emphasis on diversity of offerings, the right to read must not be un-
derstood  as  limited  to  educational  materials  or  nonfiction  works.  
Certainly, scientific literature, educational textbooks, and nonfiction 
works  ranging  from  national  history  to  farming  techniques  offer 
unique instrumental value.  Yet fictional works ranging from high lit-
erature to pulp romances and comic books are just as relevant for the 
right to read.  These works provide readers with joy and leisure, as 
well as opportunities to imagine alternative possibilities for ourselves 
and our world.  These functions are critical to the right to read, which 
emphasizes not only education, but also cultural participation and 
freedom  of  expression.    Reading  for  knowledge  and  reading  for 
pleasure are equally important in judging the quality of the supply of 
reading material.  The right to read must not be understood as limited 
to fiction of high literary esteem; science fiction, fan fiction, pulp fic-
tion with formulaic plots, and even comic books are equally valid as 
forms of cultural expression and participation valued by some indi-
viduals.129 
Given that the right to read requires a diverse supply of rele-
vant reading material in every language, how far does that right ex-
tend?  Perhaps someday the technology of translation and mecha-
nisms of digital access will be so fast and so cheap that every person 
can enjoy access to any of the world’s written works.  In the mean-
time, it remains impossible to translate every work into each of the 
world’s more than 6,000 languages.  Even if this could be achieved, 
moreover, translations alone would not solve the problem that the ex-
isting supply of books over-represents the interests and experiences 
 
  129.  See Anupam Chander & Madhavi Sunder, Everyone’s a Superhero:  A Cultural 
Theory of “Mary Sue” Fan Fiction as Fair Use, 95 CAL. L. REV. 597 (2007) (elaborating on

2015]  THE RIGHT TO READ  41 
of relatively wealthy Westerners, and inadequately addresses the in-
formation  needs,  interests,  and  experiences  of  cultural  subgroups 
with less disposable income. 
Given these dilemmas, is there a minimally adequate selec-
tion that we can say satisfies the right to read?  The standard is cer-
tainly not the impossible goal that every work be available in every 
language.  The human rights principle of “progressive realization” 
presumes some level of cost-benefit analysis in the realization of so-
cioeconomic rights.  Put another way, human rights law “reads into 
the provision some kind of a reasonableness test.”130  For example, 
people who have enjoyed sufficient educational advantages in life to 
be able to substantively appreciate a journal article on theoretical 
physics may also reasonably be expected to learn to read that article 
in English.  Not every form of work needs to be available in every 
language.  The goal should be to have a reasonably flourishing body 
of literature available at least in all those languages of a certain size.  
One fourth of all languages have fewer than 1,000 speakers; more 
than half have fewer than 10,000.131  For such very small languages, 
the selection might be very narrow indeed.  But there is much to be 
gained from ensuring that readers in all languages have access to 
even several hundred desirable and relevant works. 
We should also be careful not to set our ambitions too low.  
Icelandic is spoken by only about 300,000 people.132  Yet the Ice-
landic language has a flourishing literature, offers an effective path-
way to advanced education for Icelanders, and is a source of great 
cultural and personal pride to its people.133  A recent catalog lists 
more than 800 Icelandic books for sale across a diversity of genres, 
and more than a million loans take place each year from the Rey-
kjavík City Library.134  The Icelandic Publisher’s Association esti-
mates that 1,500 titles are published annually.135  Popular Icelandic

by offering subsidies to translate selected books into English.136 
In sum, the dimension of acceptability means that books must 
be available that people actually want to read.  A high number of 
publications ensures diversity, choice, and probably positively influ-
ences quality at the upper end.  There can be no arbitrary number of 
titles above which we say that the right to read is satisfied and below 
which we say that the right is violated.  More is always better.  Note 
that when it comes to acceptability, we are concerned with the diver-
sity of unique titles, whereas on the dimension of adequacy, we were 
concerned about the total number of copies. 
To put it another way, adequacy is about whether people can 
get their hands on books, acceptability is about whether they can get 
their hands on books that they love.  This difference is nicely illus-
trated by a case brought by a British prisoner, who sought the right to 
receive specific books she wished to read, beyond the limited selec-
tion available in the prison library and prison store.  The Prison Ser-
vice had enacted a ban on packages containing books, citing the ad-
ministrative burdens of searching packages for drugs and “extremist 
materials.”  A judge ordered the policy to be changed, emphasizing 
the importance of readers being able to access the particular books 
that are acceptable to them:  “A book may not only be one which a 
prisoner may want to read but may be very useful or indeed neces-
sary as part of a rehabilitation process.”137 
D. Integrating the Three Dimensions 
The previous sections have separately detailed the three di-
mensions of liberty, capacity, and availability.  These three dimen-
sions of the right to read are not entirely independent, however, but 
have interactions between them.  For example, if a government pro-
hibits the publication of books in a given language, this directly vio-
lates the liberty to read.  Such a prohibition, however, will ultimately 
have an impact on availability as well.  Censorship may also result in 
a shortage of books expressing alternative perspectives, such that the 
book supply ultimately fails the acceptability criterion.  Likewise, if a 
particular government fails to promote literacy among its population, 
the prospects for the availability of literature in its local languages 
are dim.  Conversely, if reading materials are generally unavailable in

a  particular  language,  members  of  that  language  community  will 
have fewer opportunities to develop their literacy.  A smaller pool of 
active readers not only results in a more limited audience for writers 
and publishers to market to, but also inhibits the development of the 
next generation of writers.  In this way, availability affects literacy 
and literacy affects availability.  The dynamic among these three di-
mensions may reflect either a vicious cycle or a virtuous one. 
Integrating the three dimensions, we may say that the right to 
read  is  ultimately  satisfied  within  a  country  when  all  people—
including the poor—are empowered to access an ample and diverse 
supply of books in the languages they understand.  Today, it must be 
said that this goal is still far from being met in too many places.  
Eliminating censorship and illiteracy remain significant challenges.  
To this list we must add the new challenge of addressing the availa-
bility dimension.  Specifically, we must look to unlock the potential 
of publishing in local languages and find more effective ways of get-
ting relevant reading material into the hands of the poor.  In this ef-
fort we need to keep in mind that the right to read requires far more 
than ensuring access to textbooks.  Freedom of expression, participa-
tion in cultural life, and the flourishing of minority communities re-
quire a diverse ecosystem of opportunities for reading and writing 
throughout one’s lifetime, both to acquire knowledge and to explore 
and imagine alternative worlds. 
III. OBJECTIONS AND IMPLICATIONS 
Having laid out a theoretical framework for understanding the 
right to read, the final part of this article explores more concrete im-
plications.  In particular, I consider what recognition of the right to 
read would mean for governments, authors, and publishers, with spe-
cial reference to the relevance of copyright law for promoting the 
right to read.  First, however, I address the concern that recognizing 
the right to read might undermine efforts to protect existing rights 
that may be more important or fundamental, such as freedom of ex-
pression, freedom from torture, or the right to health. 
A. Objections to “New” Human Rights 
To accord something the status of a human right, and to advo-
cate for efforts to address it through human rights institutions and 
techniques, necessarily holds both costs and benefits.  Human rights 
language  can  bring  greater  legitimacy  or  perceived  urgency  to  a 
cause.  Many would argue, however, that this power must be used  
44  COLUMBIA JOURNAL OF TRANSNATIONAL LAW  [54:1 
sparingly, so that it does not become diluted.  Similarly, a human 
rights frame can help to rally human rights institutions and supporters 
to an issue.  Yet again, some would view this as a negative, arguing 
that it risks distracting these bodies from more pressing needs.  De-
spite such objections, the scope of goals and claims recognized as 
human rights has steadily expanded over the last century.  Those who 
view rights expansion as a concerning trend have variously referred 
to the problem as “rights proliferation,” “rights inflation,” or the 
“overproduction” of human rights.138 
The debate over which human needs and social values should 
be recognized as true human rights, and which should be consigned 
to some second-class status, was arguably resolved by the adoption 
of the UDHR.  After extensive discussion by legal scholars and ex-
perts, representatives of many nations gathered to debate and include 
or exclude the various items.  The first two-thirds of the document 
lays out long-familiar rights to life and liberty, freedom from slavery 
and torture, equal protection of the law, a fair trial, privacy, property, 
freedom of expression, religion, association, and democratic partici-
pation, among others.  These civil and political rights are often re-
ferred to as the “first-generation” rights, because of their long intel-
lectual  and  legal  tradition.    The  last  third  of  the  UDHR  lists 
“economic, social and cultural rights” considered to be “indispensa-
ble to [the individual’s] dignity and the free development of [his or 
her] personality.”139  These include rights to social security; to just 
and favorable conditions of work; to join a union; to food, clothing, 
housing, and medical care; to special protection of motherhood and 
childhood; to education, science, and culture; and to protection of au-
thorship.  These “second-generation rights” mustered the necessary 
political consensus at the United Nations in 1948, but they have re-

mained a target of political and academic skepticism. 
Writing in 1967, Maurice Cranston objected that “a philo-
sophically respectable concept of human rights has been muddied, 
obscured, and debilitated in recent years” by the attempt to incorpo-
rate  into  it  the  second-generation  economic,  social,  and  cultural 
rights.140  These newer rights have appeal in theory, he concedes, but 
when the effort is made to put them into practice, their conceptual 
impossibilities  become  apparent.    Philosophically  the  second-
generation rights do not make sense; politically the inevitable and ir-
remediable confusion “hinders the effective protection of what are 
correctly seen as human rights.”141  The inclusion of too many utopi-
an ideals in the UDHR tars all human-rights talk with the stigma of 
naïve idealism.142  On this point, the UDHR’s inclusion of a right to 
“periodic holidays with pay” has often been questioned.143  Mean-
while, Cranston argues, efforts to advance the protection of a narrow-
er and more traditional set of human rights have proven more effec-
tive.  For example, the 1950 European Convention for the Protection 
of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms focused on civil and 
political  rights;  among  the  socioeconomic  rights,  the  Europeans 
chose to include only the right to education—and that in an optional 
protocol.144  Europe’s signatory states moved much more rapidly to 
set up binding mechanisms for vindicating these rights.145  Where 
economic and social rights were included, however, “it became im-
possible to pass from words to deeds.”146 
Developments  since  Cranston’s  time  have  partially  under-
mined such objections.  Theorists and judges have worked to resolve 
the conceptual difficulties presented by economic, social, and cultural 
rights to render them justiciable.  Today, Cranston’s objection that “it 
would be totally impossible to translate [economic, social, and cul-
tural rights] in the same way into positive rights by analogous politi-
cal and legal action” appears overstated or naïve.147  Decolonization 
and economic growth have also made the economic, social, and cul-

tural rights claims appear significantly more realistic today than a 
half century ago.  Universal primary education, universal vaccina-
tion, universal access to modern health care—these once impossible-
seeming ideals are becoming realities before our eyes. 
Arguments from impossibility are less persuasive today than 
in Cranston’s time, but concerns that recognition of newer rights will 
undermine efforts to protect more fundamental ones remain.  In the 
1980s, the stakes of this debate were further raised with the introduc-
tion of new demands for “third-generation” rights, such as the right to 
development, to peace, to a clean environment, and to the political 
and cultural self-determination of peoples.148  The addition of these 
“emerging” human rights was welcomed with open arms by some, 
ignored or derided by others.  The reasonable center of this debate 
acknowledged  the  necessity  of  flexibility  and  addition  of  human 
rights  overlooked  in  the  1940s,  but  urged  a  greater  emphasis  on 
“quality control.”149 
After the failure of modern human rights regimes to prevent 
the atrocities in Bosnia and Rwanda of the 1990s, Michael Ignatieff 
argued for a much narrower focus, concentrating efforts on stopping 
“gross physical cruelty” such as torture, beatings, killings, rape, and 
assault.150  This “minimalist” approach to human rights would cer-
tainly exclude recognition of a right to read, as well as freedom of 
expression, the right to vote, and most of the rights contained in the 
UDHR.  Ignatieff echoes Cranston in arguing that “rights inflation—
the tendency to define anything desirable as a right—ends up eroding 
the legitimacy of a defensible core of rights.  That defensible core 
ought to be those that are strictly necessary to the enjoyment of any 
life whatever.”151  Because Ignatieff emphasizes these political con-
siderations and the primacy of protection of human life, he ends up 
advocating an even narrower view of rights than the traditional “first 
generation.” 
Defenders of rights expansion point out that human rights has 
always  been  about  more  than  enforcement  of  minimal  standards.

al community uses to debate our moral responsibilities to one another 
and to set political goals for the future.152  From this view, to circum-
scribe human rights too narrowly risks cutting short the advance of 
social justice.  Additionally, new historical challenges present new 
opportunities for and threats to human freedom and welfare, which 
naturally and appropriately lead to calls for new rights.153  Thus, in 
the Internet Age we see new demands for a right to access the Inter-
net, as well as a right to data privacy.  Even those who embrace the 
thesis of rights proliferation will not agree on where to draw the line, 
which rights should be preserved, and which deserve lesser empha-
sis.154  Thus we encounter what Baxi aptly calls, “the riot of percep-
tions concerning over- or under-production of human rights norma-
tivity.”155  The degree to which the specter of “rights proliferation” is 
invoked often seems to depend more upon the degree of sympathy 
for the particular new right claim than on any firm concept of an op-
timal scope for human rights.156 
Committing to human rights in the abstract, or as a philosoph-
ical exercise, may well hinge on the nature of the particular right as-
serted.  Actually realizing human rights in practice, however, may ul-
timately depend more on broader ethical and political commitments.  
Where a particular society is strongly committed to the principles of 
human equality and dignity, we should expect it to make great efforts 
to ensure that all of its members enjoy a broad range of human rights, 
including literacy education, adequate housing, and the right to mar-
ry.  Where this commitment is low, we may find that support for 
even the most fundamental and urgent of human rights—such as fair 
trials and freedom from torture and genocide—fails to translate into 
practice. 
One possible resolution to this debate is to recognize a hierar-
chy of human rights.  Surely only a very narrow list of human rights 
violations can justify the extreme step of foreign military interven-
tion—the focus of Ignatieff’s project.  Yet a broader list of human 
rights might justify judicial intervention in the democratic process of 
lawmaking or political sanctions.  A broader list still might justify re-
allocation of resources within or between states.  And these distinc-
tions might be drawn both with respect to the feasibility of these dif-

ferent measures for advancing the particular human right in question, 
as well as judgments about the importance of one human right versus 
another. 
The official position of the international human rights regime, 
however, is that no such hierarchy exists—that it would be contrary 
to fundamental principles of human rights thought to acknowledge 
any such hierarchy.157  This may be a politically necessary fiction.  
The concern (a real one) is that if the possibility of a hierarchy of 
rights were admitted, the second-generation rights might be even fur-
ther marginalized.  It might also legitimize the wishes of some states 
to “pick and choose” which rights they believe in, taking exception 
perhaps to the right to health care, or freedom of religion, or equal 
protection.  Finally, insisting that all human rights are equal may help 
to forestall unproductive arguments among states over which should 
be prioritized, enabling international cooperation efforts to move on 
to the realization of these rights.  Nevertheless, scholars have contin-
ued to argue that a hierarchy of human rights is not only conceptually 
valid, but also descriptively accurate.158  Ironically, the refusal to 
admit the possibility of a hierarchy among human rights may backfire 
by causing new human rights claims to be rejected on the grounds 
that they do not seem as important as freedom from genocide and to 
fair elections. 
Arguably the right to read should be assigned a secondary 
priority relative to some other rights.  If it were truly necessary to 
choose between the right to food and the right to read, I for one 
would readily concede the primary importance of basic subsistence.  
The important point is that this is generally a false choice.  The pro-

Is there any hierarchy among human rights? 
No, all human rights are equally important.  The 1948 Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights makes it clear that human rights of all kinds—economic, politi-
cal, civil, cultural and social—are of equal validity and importance.  This fact 
has been reaffirmed repeatedly by the international community, for example in 
the 1986 Declaration on the Right to Development, the 1993 Vienna Declara-
tion and Programme of Action, and the near-universally ratified Convention the 
Rights of the Child.  
Human rights are also indivisible and interdependent.  The principle of their 
indivisibility recognizes that no human right is inherently inferior to any other.

2015]  THE RIGHT TO READ  49 
motion of human rights is not in fact a limited quantity.  We do not 
need to choose between the right to life and the right to read.  We can 
and should call for both to be realized.  Ultimately, to the extent that 
these rights demand an outlay of public resources, there will be po-
tentially difficult choices to make.  Governments must choose to 
spend a certain amount on food aid and public housing and a certain 
amount on literacy campaigns and libraries.  These choices rest upon 
a valuation of the relative importance of the underlying rights, as well 
as considerations of cost-effectiveness.  But jettisoning either right in 
its entirety would be an irrational and foolish solution to this resource 
challenge. 
A second necessary response to the rights proliferation objec-
tion is to point out that the right to read is not truly a “new right.”  It 
is simply a new application of long-recognized rights:  freedom of 
expression,  the  right  to  education,  etc.    This  phenomenon  is  not 
unique to the right to read.  Despite being a basic human need, water 
is nowhere mentioned in the UDHR or later covenants.  Yet claims to 
water as a human right emerged during the 1990s and the right to wa-
ter is now well recognized.159  It is possible, however, to locate the 
right to water at the intersection of previously recognized rights to 
life, health, food, and an adequate standard of living.  Similarly, the 
“right to sanitation” lies at the intersection of these rights and the 
right to housing.  The recently proposed “right to credit”160 could 
similarly be located at the intersection of the right to work, the right 
to property, and the right to an adequate standard of living.  Each of 
these  new  rights  discourses—on  water,  sanitation,  and  credit—
focuses on a specific issue that cuts across existing human rights si-
los.  Yet no term currently exists to describe this phenomenon. 
I suggest that we think of the right to read, the right to water, 
the right to sanitation, the right to credit, and others that fit this pat-
tern as “intersectional rights.”  Intersectional rights are not truly de-
mands for new human rights.  Instead, they are demands for more fo-
cused  attention  to  neglected  issues  within  human  rights.    An 
intersectional approach to human rights scholarship and advocacy 
may have unique advantages.  Because intersectional rights focus on

a narrow policy issue, they are particularly well positioned to “pro-
ceed from words to action.”  It is quite difficult to implement an ab-
stract concept such as “the right to science and culture.”  Yet the path 
to implementation of “the right to read” is clearer.  Focusing on inter-
sectional rights that cut across traditional boundaries may ultimately 
prove to be a more effective way to make progress on the realization 
of human rights, as well as pointing to a way through the rights pro-
liferation debate. 
B. Duties in Respect of the Right 
In elaborating the right to read, I imagine that the dimensions 
of liberty and capacity are relatively uncontroversial.  I also hope that 
I have persuasively made the case that we should pay greater atten-
tion to the traditional blind spot of availability.  Even if all readers 
agree on the normative desirability of expanding access to literature, 
however, this by itself does not answer the essential next question of 
how to actually achieve that goal. 
On this point, there can—and I believe should—be greater 
controversy.  The questions to be resolved at this level are both nor-
mative and empirical.  What specific goals should we aim at?  For 
example, to what extent should we prioritize children’s literature, ed-
ucational textbooks, adult non-fiction, high literature, or simple en-
tertainment?  Which methods will work or not work to achieve those 
goals?  For example, which will be most effective:  expansion of 
public libraries, charitable book donations, or driving down market 
prices?  Must these questions be answered differently with respect to 
different languages?  Finally, which methods are normatively legiti-
mate and illegitimate in pursuit of those goals?  Are price controls 
ever  appropriate?    Should  copyright  law  be  adjusted  to  facilitate 
translation, even if this means that copyright holders give up some 
control?  These questions are difficult both because they are ideolog-
ically charged, and because they rest on empirical assumptions in 
need of careful testing.  To a large extent then, this section must nec-
essarily take the form of a survey of issues and an invitation for fur-
ther study. 
1. Duties Upon States 
Some readers will resist the suggestion of any state responsi-
bility to ensure the availability of reading materials.  Education and 
health care services are a well-established province of government 
responsibility.  But we are accustomed to thinking of books as more a  
2015]  THE RIGHT TO READ  51 
function of free markets.  In reality, however, book provision has al-
ways been a mixture of market activity and public support.  Public 
and publicly-subsidized universities employ many authors, and help 
to train virtually all of them.  Public funding often supports writers’ 
living expenses.  In many countries, education departments purchase 
textbooks with tax dollars and provide them free of charge to stu-
dents.  U.S. college students must generally purchase their own text-
books, but they do so with support from federal financial aid for 
higher education.  More than a billion dollars of tax revenue is used 
to purchase books each year by community libraries in the United 
States alone.161  The true innovation of defining reading as a human 
right, therefore, is not to justify a role for government involvement in 
publishing and distribution of books that did not previously exist.  In-
stead, it is to justify an increased emphasis on equity, inclusion, and 
access as values that have previously been neglected.  This will in 
turn imply a greater role to be played both by governments and by 
charities. 
Yet as soon as we accept the right to read as a universal enti-
tlement, we must confront the challenge to define more precisely the 
corresponding duties of governments.  Is there a state duty to finan-
cially support book charities?162  Is it reasonable to expect resource-
poor countries to prioritize spending on libraries rather than other 
pressing needs in education, health care, housing, or clean water?  
Should  governments  actively  subsidize  the  production  of  original 
works through subsidies or commissions?  Or does freedom of ex-
pression require that origination efforts be left to independent non-
profits or the market?  Can legal regulations and taxes affecting the 
book market be altered to bring down costs of production and distri-
bution?163  Should governments abandon laws that limit the ability of

  162.  The state constitution of Michigan, adopted in 1963, contains a section providing 
for the funding of libraries.  See MICH. CONST. of 1963, art. VIII, § 9: 
The legislature shall provide by law for the establishment and support of public 
libraries which shall be available to all residents of the state under regulations 
adopted by the governing bodies thereof.  All fines assessed and collected in 
the several counties, townships and cities for any breach of the penal laws shall 
be exclusively applied to the support of such public libraries, and county law 
libraries as provided by law. 
  163.  For example, tax law can offer incentives for book publishers to print very large 
runs and store the extra copies for years or decades until they gradually sell by allowing 
publishers to rapidly depreciate the “asset” of stored extra copies.  Printing in larger runs 
greatly reduces the per-copy costs of printing, and can make it more economical to offer 
niche books at prices more similar to those of blockbuster books.  See, e.g., Jürgen Backhaus 
& Reginald Hansen, Resale Price Maintenance for Books in Germany and the European

book retailers to engage in price competition and scrutinize private 
agreements that have a similar effect?  All of these are open ques-
tions that deserve serious and extended discussion.  My intent is not 
to attempt to answer them all in this article.  Instead, I hope that this 
call for recognizing the right to read will help to stimulate that next-
stage discussion.  Ultimately, the best answers to these next-order 
questions are likely to differ from country to country, in light of dif-
ferent cultural, economic, and political realities. 
Socioeconomic rights, including the right to read, should not 
be understood as “trumps” that render other policy considerations ir-
relevant.164  Not every law or policy that limits the availability or af-
fordability of books is a violation of the right to read.  Within interna-
tional human rights law, rights claims are not evaluated as absolutes, 
nor even through a lens resembling American strict scrutiny.  Instead, 
they find application through a more flexible form of proportionality-
balancing that evaluates the reasonableness of state action in light of 
its positive and negative impacts on human rights.  On the flip side, 
neither is the “right to read” merely a rhetorical assertion or aspira-
tional goal with no legally enforceable content.  At a certain point, it 
is possible to say that a government’s book policy does not go far 
enough to respect and protect the right, or that a particular law vio-
lates the right to read by restricting access in an unjustifiable way.  
To precisely draw those lines, however, requires a careful considera-
tion of the details of each policy in its national context that is beyond 
the scope of this article.  Examining these various policy frameworks 
from the perspective of the right to read is a task for future scholar-
ship and normative elaboration. 
2. Duties Upon Private Actors 
The right to read also has implications for private actors.  Alt-
hough states bear the ultimate responsibility for protecting human 
rights, businesses also have obligations to respect human rights with-
in their operations.165  The U.N. Guiding Principles on Business and 
 
Union:  A Legal and Economic Analysis, in FROM ECONOMIC TO LEGAL COMPETITION:  NEW 
PERSPECTIVES ON LAW AND INSTITUTIONS IN EUROPE 335–44 (Alain Marciano & Jean-Michel 
Josselin eds., 2003) (describing the operation of the depreciation system in the German 
publishing context).

Kavanagh & John Oberdiek eds., 2009).

Human Rights and Transnational Corporations and Other Business Enterprises), Rep. on 
Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights:  Implementing the United Nations’  
2015]  THE RIGHT TO READ  53 
Human Rights (Guiding Principles) make clear that businesses have a 
duty  to  respect  the  full  range  of  rights  included  in  the  UDHR, 
ICCPR, and ICESCR, a duty which extends beyond merely comply-
ing with local laws and regulations.166  Specifically, these duties in-
clude:  (1) adopting a policy commitment to human rights compli-
ance at the highest level of the business; (2) conducting ongoing due 
diligence to understand the human rights impacts of their own opera-
tions, products, services, and business relationships; (3) taking ap-
propriate and effective action to remedy negative impacts on human 
rights to which they are connected; (4) communicating with affected 
stakeholders and the public about these activities; and (5) avoiding 
undermining the ability of states to protect human rights.167 
The operations of publishers, book distributors, and internet 
service providers are particularly important for the right to read, es-
pecially along the availability dimension.  Efforts to implement the 
Guiding Principles might include actions such as:  (1) adopting a 
high-level commitment to reading as a human right, regardless of 
language, disability, or ability to pay; (2) seeking to understand how 
their distribution models and copyright practices impact the right to 
read168; (3) setting goals and indicators for the distribution of free and 
low-cost reading material and adopting policies to facilitate transla-
tions  into  other  languages;  (4)  consulting  with  representatives  of 
print-disabled  and  minority-language  readers  to  better  understand 
their needs and publicly reporting on their ongoing efforts; and (5) 
facilitating rather than opposing efforts at the WIPO to adopt an in-
ternational instrument on copyright exceptions and limitations for li-
braries. 
This emphasis on corporate responsibility for human rights 
need not reflect a “name and shame” approach.  Rather, it should re-
flect the fact that corporations hold much of the power to effect posi-
tive change in this area, because they are central to the distribution of 
reading material.  A variety of not-for-profit efforts to expand digital 
access to reading material in developing countries have found it es-
sential to partner with publishers, because only the copyright holder 
can authorize these efforts.169  Publishers may also donate hard cop-

ies of books in large volumes to charities, either by design or because 
they have leftovers they need to dispose of, often in exchange for a 
tax write-off.170  But there are also other important ways that busi-
nesses in the book industry can promote book availability, beyond 
the most obvious context of donating copies. 
For example, Apple’s iBooks Store and other internationally 
leading platforms for the purchase of digital books work with books 
in Western scripts, but do not currently support the distribution of 
books  in  many  other  typographies,  including  Arabic-language 
books.171  This may be a sensible business decision, at least in the 
short term.  The potential profits to be made in these non-Western 
markets are smaller, and developing the software to support new ty-
pography will be costly.  But a significant consequence of this busi-
ness  decision  is  that  it  is  dramatically  more  difficult  for  Arabic 
speakers to access reading material, except for the elite minority that 
is fluent in English or French.172  If these businesses collaborate to 
develop standards that can support non-Western scripts, they will 
make a significant positive impact on the right to read, as well as 
opening up new markets for themselves. 
Book publishers also hold the legal rights to translate large 
numbers of existing works into other languages.  In a typical book 
contract, the author conveys to the publisher the right to authorize 
translations in any language, in any region of the world.  As authors 
become more successful and gain bargaining leverage, they often ne-
gotiate to retain these translation rights, later selling them piecemeal 
to foreign publishers best positioned to exploit them.  In practice, 
however, only a small percentage of the world’s languages are likely 
to generate any profit for the publisher.  Publishers could surrender 
their hold on translation rights they are unlikely to ever make use of 
by licensing any member of the public to attempt a translation in lan-
guages beyond those specifically reserved.  This would create legal 
room for innovative approaches to not-for-profit translation and dis-
tribution of these works in neglected languages. 
Again, it is not my ambition here to comprehensively recom-
 
access through a digital e-Reader or smartphone.  They all depend upon the charity of 
publishers.

mend precisely what publishers and technology companies should do 
and refrain from doing in light of the right to read.  Rather, I suggest 
that this is a conversation that should begin to take place among these 
actors, in consultation with groups that can speak to the needs of 
readers from all walks of life. 
C. Copyright Law and the Right to Read 
Although many facets of law and policy can impact the avail-
ability of reading material, copyright law is particularly relevant.  Na-
tional copyright laws dictate whether not-for-profit copying for edu-
cational purposes is encouraged or prohibited, whether permission 
must be sought to produce a translation or abridgement, whether 
companies may rent or resell books under what terms, and whether 
libraries may loan digital works to patrons.  Copyright lawmaking 
has long been informed by concern for authors’ rights, which are ex-
plicitly recognized in the international human rights documents.173  
Readers’ rights should be treated with similar concern in copyright 
policymaking and doctrinal development.174  Recognition of the right 
to read calls upon copyright lawmaking to incorporate concern for 
access and affordability of reading materials as a fundamental policy 
goal. 
Scholars and policymakers should also explore how the “right 
to read” and its emphasis on expanding access to reading material 
can inform the development of copyright law, both within the United 
States and internationally.  Copyright law should be guided both by 
notions of respect for authors’ rights, as well as respect for the fun-
damental right of everyone to read.175  Recasting would-be readers as 
bearers of human rights, rather than merely as consumers, suggests a 
very different frame for copyright and book policy.  It is no longer 
enough to speak merely of economic efficiency, incentivizing mar-
kets, and expanding the diversity of works available in the market.  
Now we must also pay attention to issues of inequality, affordability, 
and access by vulnerable groups.  In this way, introducing “the right 
to read” as a touchstone for thinking about copyright law can fore-

“copyright liberties” of readers are an integral part of the fabric of copyright law and that the 
ultimate purpose of copyright law should be to encourage reading).  
  175.  Id.

ground issues that have previously been overlooked by scholars and 
policymakers. 
Concretely, I suggest that the right to read imposes a state du-
ty to ensure that its copyright laws and related policies are well de-
signed to promote the right to read.  An important means of pursuing 
this goal is to implement national exceptions and limitations to copy-
right protection specifically designed to encourage affordable pub-
lishing and distribution.  In this effort, the insight that the market for 
books works differently in different languages can point the way to 
potential  compromises.176    Copyright  rules  could  place  fewer  re-
strictions on the production and distribution of reading material in lo-
cal languages, allowing this market to operate more freely and inno-
vate low-cost business models.  National laws might also seek to 
ensure that readers purchasing ebooks are able to keep and continue 
to read purchased titles when they opt to purchase a different de-
vice.177 
A related area of law concerns national regulations adopted to 
limit price competition by book retailers.  In many countries, legisla-
tion has been passed restricting the ability of booksellers to price 
their books substantially below the publisher’s “list” price.  For ex-
ample, Israel prohibits discounting during the first eighteen months—
with an exception for an up-to-ten-percent discount during Hebrew 
Book Week and during major holiday shopping periods—and sets 
minimum royalty rates ranging from eight to sixteen percent, depend-
ing on the size of the book run and the timing of the sale.178  Many 
countries currently practice some form of fixed book pricing, includ-
ing Argentina, Austria, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Japan, Leba-
non, Mexico, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Slovenia, South Korea, 
Sri Lanka, and Spain.179  In some countries, private arrangements 
among publishers and retailers achieve the same effect without a le-

gal mandate.180  Other countries formerly practiced fixed book pric-
ing but have since abandoned it, including Australia, Denmark, Fin-
land, Ireland, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom.181 
The impact of fixed book pricing on the right to read is com-
plex.  At first glance, it seems obvious that such measures would in-
crease the price of books.  Yet supporters argue that fixed book pric-
ing results in higher prices only for bestsellers, and may lower prices 
for other books, because of cross-subsidization.182  The primary ad-
vantage argued by supporters of fixed book pricing is to provide 
greater support for publishing, which may be particularly important 
in local languages, and to encourage a greater diversity of titles to be 
published and purchased.  So far the debate remains dominated by 
ideological arguments and theoretical predictions, with little empiri-
cal research.  It is likely that the real impacts of fixed book pricing 
will differ depending on the form enacted and the national context.  
The right to read does not necessarily call for the abolition of fixed 
book pricing, but does demand that such laws be carefully studied, 
with particular concern for their impact on readers with fewer re-
sources.  In theory, legislation could also be written to permit or en-
courage different book prices for different consumers, such that a 
low-income reader, library, or other non-profit organization could 
benefit from a substantial discount off of the list price. 
In short, copyright and related legal debates have long sought 
to balance the interests of authors, publishers, and readers.  Missing 
from  this  debate,  however,  has  been  a  recognition  of  inequality 
among readers.183  The human rights perspective brought by attention 
to the right to read encourages us to recognize the dilemma of vul-
nerable groups who will experience difficulty purchasing books with-
in their income, or even finding books in their language.  With great-
er  attention  to  this  problem,  legal  and  policy  solutions  can  be 
identified to help bridge the book gap.184  Even in countries where in-
ternational human rights law has little or no legal authority as such, 
rhetorical invocation of a right to read—and insistence on the under-
lying principle that books, ebooks, and other reading material should

CONCLUSION 
Well-recognized norms of international human rights law in-
clude freedom of expression, the right to education, children’s media 
rights, the right to take part in cultural life, and the right of minority 
groups to use their own languages.  Building upon these existing 
norms, this article has proposed recognition of an intersectional hu-
man right to read.  The right to read has three dimensions:  the liberty 
to read and write in any language, the individual capacity to read and 
write (literacy), and the reasonable availability of a broad range of 
accessible reading materials in one’s preferred language.  The first 
two dimensions are familiar and relatively uncontroversial.  States 
must refrain from censorship and other measures that would limit 
minority language education or publishing.  States also have a posi-
tive duty to provide educational opportunities to help children and 
adults develop literacy.  Less well understood at present is the state’s 
duty to promote affordable access to reading materials.  This goal 
cannot be left purely to market forces, but requires government, char-
itable, and business efforts to facilitate the availability of affordable 
reading materials in all languages and ensure that they are accessible 
even to disadvantaged populations.
