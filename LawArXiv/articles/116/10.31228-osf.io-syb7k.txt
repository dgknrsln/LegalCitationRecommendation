THE MARK OF A RESOLD GOOD 
Yvette Joy Liebesman* and Benjamin Wilson** 
INTRODUCTION 
The cosmetics giant Mary Kay requires that its Independent Beauty 
Consultants purchase at least $200 worth of product each month.1 Unfortu-
nately for Amy Weber, her relationship with Mary Kay was terminated 
because she failed to purchase the monthly minimum.2 To dispose of her 
large inventory of unsold products, Mrs. Weber sold the products through 
her website, touchofpinkcosmetics.com, and through her “Touch of Pink” 
eBay store.3  
In 2008, Mary Kay brought action against Mrs. Weber in a Texas fed-
eral court under the Lanham Act, alleging that she was an unaffiliated 
online reseller of Mary Kay cosmetics and that her sales therefore constitut-
ed  unfair  competition,  passing  off,  and  trademark  infringement.4  In  its 
pleadings, Mary Kay claimed that the website and eBay store’s names cre-
ated confusion as to affiliation or sponsorship—that is, consumers would 
wrongly assume that Weber was an authorized Independent Beauty Con-
sultant affiliated with Mary Kay, even if that confusion ended prior to sale. 5 
In her motion for summary judgment, Mrs. Weber argued that the first 
sale and nominative fair use doctrines rendered her sales lawful under the 
Lanham Act.6 The court, however, denied her motion,7 and Mrs. Weber

name “Touch of Pink” as her store name,9 from “using any portion of Mary 
Kay’s product descriptions to describe the products for sale on the defend-

  14  Recent scholarship has focused on such areas as:  
(1)  trademark infringement as it relates to metatags and search engines, see, e.g., Stacey L. 
Dogan & Mark A. Lemley, Trademarks and Consumer Search Costs on the Internet, 41

(2)  online first sale doctrine with regard to copyright infringement, see, e.g., Benjamin Wil-
son, Comment, Notice, Takedown, and the Good-Faith Standard: How to Protect Internet 
Users from Bad-Faith Removal of Web Content, 29 ST. LOUIS U. PUB. L. REV. 613,

(3)  free-riding, see Mark A. Lemley & Mark P. McKenna, Owning Mark(et)s, 109 MICH. L.

(4)  trademark bullying, see, e.g., Leah Chan Grinvald, Shaming Trademark Bullies, 2011 
WIS. L. REV 625, 628.  
Other scholars focus on competitors who infringe by misleading traffic away from the mark owner’s 
website to the competitor’s site—where the consumer sees the competitor’s goods, instead of the mark 
owner’s. See, e.g., Eric Goldman, Deregulating Relevancy in Internet Trademark Law, 54 EMORY L.J. 
507, 561 (2005).

cies that advance the mark owner’s ability to control all distribution chan-
nels would harm consumers and disincentivize competition; manufacturers 
would have less motivation to innovate and improve their product when 
they control all distribution of goods beyond their first sale.15 
This Article argues for an end to spurious claims of confusion where 
genuine goods are sold outside the manufacturer’s distribution channel, as 
long as the reseller clearly disclaims any affiliation with the manufacturer 
or authorized distributor. This is in accord with the work of other scholars 
who have reached similar conclusions regarding irrelevant confusion,16 the 
weak state of trademark fair use,17 and the inadequacy of trademark defens-
es.18 As with arguments in these areas, this Article contends that mark own-
ers’ attempts to increase the scope of their control over distribution chan-
nels thwart competition while doing little to protect consumers from decep-
tion.19 These suggestions would protect the lawful sale of goods in the sec-
ondary market while allowing manufacturers to prevent counterfeit prod-
ucts from being sold online.  
To begin this discussion, Part I looks at the nature of the Internet re-
sale business, and the issues facing resellers regarding the use of the marks 
that are attached to the goods sold. This section tackles some of the practi-
cal difficulties that confront small resellers attempting to defend themselves 
against the mark owners in court. Part II focuses on the substantive legal 
issues that arise when a manufacturer uses initial interest confusion and a 
reseller’s non-affiliation with “official” distribution channels of the good to 
limit competition. This Part examines how some courts have interpreted the 
law regarding fair use and confusion with regard to the online resale of 
genuine goods in a way that weakens the first sale doctrine in the process, 
   
  15  See generally Lemley & McKenna, supra note 14, at 187. 
 
[Trademark law] is designed to facilitate a competitive marketplace by allowing consumers 
to know what they are buying . . . . But a trademark law that is distorted into a right to own 
markets—one that seeks out and tries to forbid all free riding on a mark—ends up interfering 
with rather than enabling competition.

consequence for consumers—if they are not hurt as a result—it is not something trademark law should

as well as the overlap of trademark and copyright infringement claims in 
the online resale market.  
Part III elaborates on trademark law’s fair use and first sale defenses, 
and some courts’ reluctance to recognize these defenses in the case of re-
sold goods. Part IV proposes that courts strengthen trademark’s nominative 
fair use and first sale doctrines, while discounting the controversial doctrine 
of initial interest confusion, to protect legitimate online merchants while 
recognizing the need for manufacturers to stop online counterfeiters. We 
conclude that the first sale doctrine, which is well-established in patent and 
copyright law, and considered by both the courts and Congress as an im-
portant limitation to a mark owner’s Lanham Act rights in the brick-and-
mortar setting, should include a presumption of non-infringement when a 
reseller is using a mark to truthfully inform consumers about the source of a 
genuine good. 
I.  THAT’S GONNA LEAVE A MARK 
When one buys a Waterford crystal vase, the Waterford mark remains 
associated with the vase. No matter how many times that vase is sold, trad-
ed, gifted, regifted, or bequeathed, it remains identified as a Waterford vase. 
This serves a trademark’s dual function of identifying the source of the vase 
and protecting the Waterford brand equity.20 “[T]rademark law protects the 
producer from pirates and counterfeiters” and others who would attempt to 
exploit the good will established by Waterford.21 However, merely because 
the Waterford mark remains inextricably linked to its vases as a source in-
dicator does not and should not protect Waterford from controlling down-
stream sales of their goods outside their own distribution chains.22 And 
while the Lanham Act is intended to promote quality goods and services by 
protecting producers’ good will, it is irrelevant whether the customer even 
knows the identity of the source.23 Consumers need not be able to identify 
the company behind a mark—for example, the fact that Kimberly-Clark 
makes “Huggies” disposable diapers is unimportant, so long as the consum-

trademark protection serves a dual purpose: it “protects the public by making consumers confident that 
they can identify brands they prefer and can purchase those brands without being confused or misled”). 
In addition, the report states that the second function of trademark law is to protect the brand equity of 
mark owners, who spend “conside[r]able time and money bringing a product to the marketplace.” Id.

A.  From Garage Sales and Consignment Shops to the Internet 
Over the past ten years, casual resellers have migrated from garage 
sales, swap meets, and classified ads to eBay and Craigslist, turning side 
hobbies into lucrative businesses. Today, there are hundreds of books about 
selling goods online;25 every month 30 million new ads are posted on 
Craigslist,26 and every day six million new listings are posted on eBay.27 
The explosive online market has affected the sales of new goods, troubling 
manufacturers;28 in turn, mark owners seek to curtail the growth of this sec-
ondary market through several avenues—some legitimate, and others not so 
much.29 For example, to combat diversion to resellers outside of its official 
distribution chain, Tiffany, Inc., the well-known jeweler, attempted to insti-
tute a policy of limiting retail sales of identical items to lots of five or few-
er, though this proved to be unsuccessful due to its sporadic enforcement.30  
Manufacturers have also used other means to stifle the resale market, 
such as filing claims of trademark and copyright infringement against both 
resellers and auction sites,31 attempting wholesale removal of their goods on

auction websites and other unauthorized distribution channels,32 and using 
auction site take-down notice procedures that are supposed to be reserved 
for removing counterfeit and infringing goods.33 These actions go beyond 
trademark bullying and are more than merely stopping a merchant from 
using the owner’s mark—the goal is to remove the reseller’s goods from the 
market altogether.34  
Courts have aided manufacturers by ignoring the lack of confusion as 
to a good’s source and finding that online initial interest confusion as to 
sponsorship or affiliation of the distribution channel—even when the goods 
are the genuine goods of the mark owner—constitutes infringement.35 Mary 
Kay, Inc. v. Weber,36 for example, illustrated this phenomenon.37 These 
courts’ reasoning is contradicted by strong evidence showing that many 
consumers visit sites like eBay and Craigslist for the purpose of finding 
genuine goods at lower costs than they would find buying directly from the 
mark owner or authorized retailer, and are therefore not confused as to affil-
iation regarding distribution channel.38 This is just one of many reasons, 
unrelated to trying to find the mark owner, for a consumer to use the mark 
in question as an Internet search term.39 
B.  Genuine Goods 
As long as the customer is not confused as to the source of these genu-
ine goods, then the identity of the purveyor of the goods—whether it be the 
mark owner’s own distribution channel or a reseller40—should be irrelevant. 
As source identifiers, marks “provide[] consumers with information they

  35  Goldman, supra note 14, at 585. Under a claim of initial interest confusion, a mark owner is 
arguing that there is trademark infringement because, even though the consumers’ confusion is “dis-
pelled before an actual sale occurs,” the end result is that the defendant “impermissibly capitalizes on 
the [good will] associated with a mark . . . .” Playboy Enters. v. Netscape Commc’ns Corp., 354 F.3d

  38  See Goldman, supra note 14, at 577. Professor Eric Goldman discusses how customer surveys 
and other data show a variety of reasons for the use of trademark search terms, including finding distri-
bution sources other than those authorized by the mark owner, and that there no evidence of confusion 
based on use of search terms. See id. at 522, 565.

need (and cannot otherwise readily obtain) in order to match their desires to 
particular products.”41 Indeed, the legislative history of the Lanham Act and 
related case law recognizes the need to protect consumers from passing off 
or otherwise confusing customers into purchasing goods that are not the 
genuine goods of the mark owner.42 Trademarks serve to (1) foster competi-
tion in the marketplace;43 (2) encourage manufacturers to maintain the qual-
ity of goods;44 (3) “discourage[] those who hope to sell inferior products by 
capitalizing on a consumer’s inability quickly to evaluate the quality of an 
item offered for sale”;45 (4) help consumers locate products and services 
more efficiently;46 and (5) serve as a “species of advertising.”47 And while 
trademark protection may have some anticompetitive consequences, “such 
protection may nevertheless remain justified so long as the mark improves 
the flow of otherwise indiscernible information concerning . . . the product 
to consumers, and . . . consumer desires to producers.”48 
C.  The Harsh Realities of Pursuing Justice 
Although it would appear that—based on nominative fair use and first

Internet service providers (“ISPs”) and online auction sites, may be enough 
to shut down a secondary market business.49 The ISPs and auction sites also 
may face accusations of contributory infringement should they refuse to 
remove listings for the allegedly offending goods.50  
The roadblocks faced by small resellers who choose to defend them-
selves against the mark owners in court find the odds stacked against them 
even in getting to the courthouse steps. Even those who want to either pro-
actively fight mark owners through declaratory judgment actions or defend 
themselves against infringement may not have the resources to do so. 
Oftentimes, the small reseller is unable to afford an attorney to defend 
itself,51 or if on the offensive, the stakes are too small for it to be economi-
cally feasible for an attorney to pursue a claim on behalf of the client.52 One 
illustration of the hardships fighting these claims involves reseller Karen 
Dudnikov, who, along with her husband, Michael Meadors, owns an eBay 
online auction store called Tabber’s Temptations.53 Shortly after Ms. Dud-
nikov began listing goods for sale on eBay, she started having to defend

A trademark owner’s threat that it will sue the small business or individual if they do not 
comply with its demands is often enough economic pressure to force the small business or 
individual into compliance. Additionally, bullying occurs (when coupled with an unreasona-
ble interpretation of rights) when trademark owners include a demand for attorney’s fees in 
their cease-and-desist letters—even if the recipient complies—or claims that attorney’s fees 
and costs will be awarded when the litigation against the small business or individual is 
found in favor of the large corporation (and the letter is often couched in terms that lead the 
recipient to conclude that the only outcome is that the large corporation will win). The small 
business or individual has no way of knowing that attorney’s fees are awarded only in rare 
instances of trademark infringement.

One of the consequences of the soaring cost of litigation is that many businesses simply can-
not afford the expense of bringing an infringement suit, even if attorneys’ fees may be recov-
ered in the end. This problem is exacerbated by the fact that many significant technological 
innovations are developed by smaller businesses lacking the financial resources to sue larger 
companies which are likely to defend vigorously. Furthermore, many intellectual property

with the goods she was selling.54 At various times, Ms. Dudnikov’s auctions 
were shut down due to recurring take-down notices, even though each time 
she successfully defended the claim and had the item relisted.55 But in 2003, 
Major League Baseball (“MLB”) had eBay delist items containing various 
baseball team logos,56 and was able to have some of Ms. Dudnikov’s auc-

The attorneys with whom they spoke advised the couple either they 
had no case, or that it wasn’t worth pursuing,58 so Dudnikov and Meadors 
chose to bring a declaratory judgment action against MLB pro se, based on 
the trademark nominative fair use and copyright first sale doctrines.59 Even-

Disney fabric that had been legally purchased, and turned into aprons, tissue box holders, and comfort-

Karen Dudnikov chose to fight and publicized their struggle online 
against these large corporations.63 Her inability to hire an attorney to repre-
sent them in her declaratory judgment action exemplifies one of several 
roadblocks facing resellers when they seek to defend their livelihoods.64 
And many small businesses would most likely choose to close shop rather 
than spend the energy and money required to defend themselves against the 
behemoths.65 Due to the high costs of prolonged litigation, resellers who 
most likely would have a valid nominative fair use claim may not be able 
defend themselves.66 As noted by Professor William McGeveran, several 
ways in which courts that do follow New Kids on the Block v. News Ameri-
ca Publishing, Inc.67 apply nominative fair use in a way to make it “less 
effective in delivering clear and swift resolutions that reduce chilling effects 
on speech.”68  
Reseller-defendants may face the same fate as Veoh Networks, which, 
even though it was cleared of copyright infringement liability, was fatally 
wounded defending itself.69 “Veoh is legal, but Veoh is dead—killed by 
rightsowner lawfare that bled it dry. Meanwhile, rightsowners wrongly as-
sessed the legality of Veoh, but the worst consequence they suffered was 
overpaying their lawyers.”70 Likewise, resellers may be dead right, but dead 
nonetheless if they attempt to fight big plaintiffs who are more concerned 
with shutting down competition than proving infringement.

suits brought against online resellers are claims of either infringement,72 or 
false designation of origin or description73 regarding the reseller’s affiliation 
with the mark owner as an “authorized” distributor, often based on initial 
interest confusion.74 Other claims are sometimes also alleged, including 
trademark dilution,75 tortious interference with business relations,76 copy-
right infringement,77 and false advertising.78  
A.  Claiming All Sorts of Confusion 
When asserting a claim of confusion as to affiliation, in her prima fa-
cie case, a plaintiff mark owner must demonstrate that (1) she is the owner 
of a registered mark; (2) the defendant has used a mark in commerce in 
connection with goods or services as an indicator of source or sponsorship; 
   
  72  15 U.S.C. § 1114(1) provides relief for registered marks: 
 
Any person who shall, without the consent of the registrant— 
. . . use in commerce any reproduction, counterfeit, copy, or colorable imitation of a 
registered mark in connection with the sale, offering for sale, distribution, or advertising 
of any goods or services on or in connection with which such use is likely to cause con-
fusion, or to cause mistake, or to deceive . . . 
shall be liable in a civil action by the registrant[.] 
 
15 U.S.C. § 1114(1) (2006); see also SCHECHTER & THOMAS, supra note 44, at 636 n.4.  
  73  Under 15 U.S.C. § 1125(a)(1), 
 
Any person who, on or in connection with any goods or services. . . uses in commerce any 
word, term, name, symbol, or device. . . or any false designation of origin, false or mislead-
ing description of fact, or false or misleading representation of fact, which— 
. . . is likely to cause confusion, or to cause mistake, or to deceive as to the affiliation, connec-
tion, or association of such person with another person, or as to the origin, sponsorship, or ap-
proval of his or her goods, services, or commercial activities by another person . . .  
shall be liable in a civil action by any person who believes that he or she is or is likely to be 
damaged by such act.

distinctive . . . shall be entitled to an injunction against another person who, at any time after owner’s 
mark has become famous, commences use of a mark or trade name in commerce that is likely to cause 
dilution by blurring or dilution by tarnishment of the a famous mark, regardless of the presence or 
absence of actual or likely confusion, of competition, or of actual economic injury.”).

and (3) this use is likely to cause customer confusion.79 Of these elements, 
the last is the key in any infringement suit.80 Supposedly, “likelihood” is not 
the mere possibility of confusion; customer confusion must be “probable,”81 
and the likelihood of confusion must affect an “appreciable or substantial 
number of consumers.”82 Each circuit uses a similar set of factors to make 
this determination.83 The factors adopted by the Second Circuit in Polaroid 
Corp. v. Polarad Electronics Corp.84 are typical of those used by other cir-
cuits.85

    Polaroid is a world-renowned manufacturer of photographic equipment, sheet-polarizing mate-
rial, optical desk lamps, and other electronics products. Polaroid, 287 F.2d at 494. Polaroid sued Polarad 
Electronics (manufacturer of microwave devices and television-studio equipment) for trademark in-
fringement due to the similarity of its name and the proximity of the goods the two corporations manu-
factured. Id. at 493-95. In ruling in favor of Polaroid, the Second Circuit listed eight factors to be used to 
determine whether there is a likelihood of confusion: (1) the strength of the plaintiff’s mark; (2) the 
degree of similarity between the plaintiff’s and the defendant’s marks; (3) the proximity of the products 
or services covered by the marks; (4) the likelihood that the plaintiff will bridge the gap; (5) evidence of 
actual confusion of consumers; (6) the defendant’s good faith in adopting the mark; (7) the quality of the 
defendant’s product or service; and (8) consumer sophistication. Id. at 495. 
    Other circuits have adopted their own, similar versions of the Polaroid factors. For example, the 
Tenth Circuit uses a six-factor test first delineated in Sally Beauty Co. v. Beautyco, Inc., 304 F.3d 964, 
972 (10th Cir. 2002), declaring that, for determining likelihood of confusion, courts in that circuit exam-
ine  
 
(1) the degree of similarity between the marks; (2) the intent of the alleged infringer in adopt-
ing the mark; (3) evidence of actual confusion; (4) similarity of products and manner of mar-
keting; (5) the degree of care likely to be exercised by purchasers; and (6) the strength or 
weakness of the marks. 
 
Id.; see also Austl. Gold, Inc. v. Hatfield, 436 F.3d 1228, 1240 (10th Cir. 2006) (noting that “[n]o one 
factor is dispositive, and likelihood of confusion is a question of fact”). 
  86  See, e.g., Designer Skin, LLC. v. S & L Vitamins, Inc., 560 F. Supp. 2d 811, 818 (D. Ariz. 
2008) (where the mark owner argued “that the visible uses of its marks on the websites in close associa-
tion with [the defendant’s] own logo” was a form of initial interest confusion). This claim failed on 
summary judgment. Id. at 827. 2012]  THE MARK OF A RESOLD GOOD  169 
reseller’s website, the consumer immediately realizes this is not the case.87 
As noted by Professors Mark Lemley and Mark McKenna, “‘sponsorship’ 
or ‘affiliation’ could refer to virtually any relationship between the parties,” 
even ones that do not create any material confusion on the part of the con-
sumer.88 These terms are not defined in the Lanham Act, “so courts must 
interpret  those  terms  and  their  interaction  with  the  confusion  require-
ment.”89 
In their assertions, mark owners often compare this initial interest con-
fusion to a “bait and switch”—the plaintiff claims that the defendant has 
used the plaintiff’s mark in a way that gains the consumers’ initial atten-
   
  87  See 15 U.S.C. § 1125(a)(1) (“Any person who, on or in connection with any goods or services 
. . . uses in commerce any word, term, name, symbol, or device, or any combination thereof . . . which 
. . . is likely to . . . deceive as to the affiliation, connection, . . . or as to the origin, sponsorship, or ap-
proval of his or her goods, services . . . shall be liable in a civil action by any person who believes that 
he or she is or is likely to be damaged by such act.”). This is considered forward confusion, which 
occurs when the mark owner is arguing that “the alleged trademark infringer [is taking] advantage of the 
reputation and good will of a senior trademark owner by adopting a similar or identical mark.” Harlem 
Wizards Entm’t Basketball, Inc. v. NBA Props., Inc. 952 F. Supp. 1084, 1091 (D.N.J. 1997). The two 
other major forms of confusion—reverse and post-sale confusion—are less prevalent in claims by mark 
owners against internet resellers. In reverse confusion, “a larger, more powerful entity adopts the trade-
mark of a smaller, less powerful trademark user and thereby causes confusion as to the origin of the 
senior trademark user’s goods or services.” Id. “Post-sale confusion occurs when use of a trademark 
leads individuals (other than the purchaser) mistakenly to believe that a product was manufactured by 
the trademark-holder.” Gibson Guitar Corp. v. Paul Reed Smith Guitars, LP, 423 F.3d 539, 549 (6th Cir. 
2005). It can occur, in some courts’ views, when a manufacturer offers a consumer a cheap knockoff of 
a more expensive Louis Vuitton bag; the buyer acquires the prestige of owning what appears to be the 
more  expensive product.  See Malletier v. Dooney  & Bourke,  Inc. 561 F. Supp. 2d 368, 384 
n.112 (S.D.N.Y. 2008). And while the purchaser knows it is a knock-off of a Louis Vuitton bag, others 
seeing the purchaser with the bag are not aware of this, and instead associate the cheap knock-off with 
the mark owner’s product. Id. at 384. In addition to the mark owner being associated with inferior 
goods,  
 
[t]he creation of confusion in the post-sale context can be harmful in that if there are too 
many knockoffs in the market, sales of the originals may decline because the public is fearful 
that what they are purchasing may not be an original. Furthermore, the public may be de-
ceived in the resale market if it requires expertise to distinguish between an original and a 
knockoff. Finally, the purchaser of an original is harmed by the widespread existence of 
knockoffs because the high value of originals, which derives in part from their scarcity, is 
lessened.

tion.90 Initial interest confusion relies on the notion that, due to being initial-
ly drawn to the competitor,  
 
[e]ven though the consumer eventually may realize that the product is not the one originally 
sought, he or she may stay with the competitor. In that way, the competitor has captured the 
trademark holder’s potential visitors or customers. 
     Even if the consumer eventually becomes aware of the source’s actual identity, or where 
no actual sale results, there is nonetheless damage to the trademark. This damage can mani-
fest itself in three ways: (1) the original diversion of the prospective customer’s interest to a 
source that he or she erroneously believes is authorized; (2) the potential consequent effect of 
that diversion on the customer’s ultimate decision whether to purchase caused by an errone-
ous impression that two sources of a product may be associated; and (3) the initial credibility 
that the would-be buyer may accord to the infringer’s products—customer consideration that 
otherwise may be unwarranted and that may be built on the strength of the protected mark, 
reputation and [good will].91  
 
Initial interest confusion is a controversial claim and has not been ac-
cepted by all circuits. On the one hand, the Ninth Circuit recognizes “that 
the use of another’s trademark in a manner calculated ‘to capture initial 
consumer attention, even though no actual sale is finally completed as a 
result of the confusion, may be still an infringement.’”92 The Fourth Circuit, 
however, describes it as “relatively new and sporadically applied” and has 
refused to consider the doctrine as a legitimate claim under the Lanham 
Act.93 
   
  90  See Vail Assocs., Inc. v. Vend-Tel-Co., 516 F.3d 853, 872 (10th Cir. 2008) (“Initial interest 
confusion is a ‘bait and switch’ tactic that permits a competitor to lure consumers away from a service 
provider by passing off services as those of the provider, notwithstanding that the confusion is dispelled 
by the time of sale.”). For a synopsis of the case history of initial interest confusion, see Rothman, supra 
note 14, at 114-21. In spite of Rothman’s fervent attack on the doctrine, initial interest confusion has 
unfortunately yet to meet its demise. Id. at 121-30.

v. Beckman Instruments, Inc., 718 F.2d 1201, 1207 (1st Cir. 1983)), aff’d, 236 F.3d 57 (1st Cir. 2001); 
see also Goldman, supra note 14, at 565-66 (“[Initial interest confusion] is predicated on multiple mis-
taken and empirically unsupported assumptions about searcher behavior. . . . [It is based on the unsup-
ported assumption] that a searcher using a trademarked keyword is looking for the trademark owner (or, 
perhaps, some authorized licensee or secondary user.” (footnote omitted)). Professor Goldman discusses 
in detail the various reasons—other than trying to find the mark owner—for a consumer to be using the 
mark in question as a search term. Id. at 521-28. 2012]  THE MARK OF A RESOLD GOOD  171 
The initial interest confusion doctrine “is at odds with the purpose, in-
tent, and literal meaning of the Lanham Act”94 and we should question the 
outright validity of the doctrine.95 As Professor Jennifer Rothman argues, 
[a]pplication of the initial interest confusion doctrine prevents comparative advertisements, 
limits information available to consumers, and shuts down speech critical of trademark hold-
ers and their products and services. The initial interest confusion doctrine undermines the 
free market system under a misguided notion that competition in and of itself is unfair.96 
B.  Acts of Aggression 
Encouraged by the expansion of trademark protection in the courts, 
mark owners have become increasingly aggressive in policing their marks.97 
Since “the middle part of the twentieth century, courts [have] expanded the 
range of actionable confusion beyond confusion over the actual source of a 
product—trademark law’s traditional concern—to include claims against 
uses that might confuse consumers about whether the trademark owner 
sponsors or is affiliated with the defendant[.]”98 Courts are finding liability 
even when consumers “couldn’t possibly have been confused about the 
actual source of the defendants’ products.”99 
The actionable confusion, according to these courts, was not confusion that would have led 
consumers to buy the wrong product, or even to wrongly think they were buying from the 
trademark owner. Rather, the theory in [the examples described by Professors Lemley and 
McKenna] was that consumers would think there was some relationship between the trade-
mark owner and the defendant based on the defendant’s use of the trademark. The problem 
with this formulation is that it fails to specify the types of relationships about which confu-
sion is relevant or the harm that supposedly flows from confusion about those relation-
ships.100

  100  Id. at 421-22. 172  GEO. MASON L. REV.  [VOL. 20:1 
Resellers are often at the mercy of spurious trademark and copyright 
infringement claims, and some courts have ignored affirmative defenses in 
finding infringement.101 As discussed supra, and as illustrated in the Mary 
Kay decision, some courts have accepted that confusion with regard to dis-
tribution of genuine goods is a valid form of trademark infringement, ignor-
ing that there is no confusion as to the source of the goods—thus eviscerat-
ing the first sale affirmative defense.102 These forms of confusion, however, 
were not envisioned to apply to a competitor’s use of the mark to sell the 
mark owner’s own goods.103 Rather, it “results when a consumer seeks a 
particular trademark holder’s product and instead is lured to the product of 
a competitor by the competitor’s use of the same or a similar mark.”104 
Thus, in spite of the genuineness of the article sold through resellers, 
these online resale businesses face the prospect of infringement suits, due to 
courts’  broadening  interpretation  of  what  constitutes  actionable  confu-
sion.105 By rejecting a first sale defense based on initial interest confusion—
which lowers the bar for a finding of a likelihood of confusion and thus 
infringement liability—“courts have made it very difficult to resell goods 
online.”106 In essence, the ability to successfully claim initial interest confu-
sion based on the distribution channel eviscerates the first sale/exhaustion 
defense for Internet resellers, even when any confusion ends before the sale 
is consummated.107 For Amy Weber, this meant that her claim that she was

C.  Mixing It Up 
Mark owners have also sought to indirectly stifle resellers by accusing 
the resellers’ web hosts of infringement through claims of contributory in-
fringement.110 ISPs and online auction sites would find it very useful if there 
were an Internet safe harbor provision in the Lanham Act similar to the one 
that currently exists for copyright owners.111 Under Section 512 of the Cop-
yright Act, if a rights holder notifies a service provider such as eBay that 
infringing copyrighted material is stored in its system, in order to be im-
mune from a suit for monetary damages, the service provider must prompt-
ly remove the allegedly infringing work.112 The limitations of copyright

rights, however, should, in theory, thwart attempts to remove listings of 
genuine items for resale.113 However, this copyright misuse leaves the mark 
owners vulnerable to lawsuits under Section 512(f) of the Digital Millenni-
um Copyright Act (“DMCA”).114 
The Copyright Act of 1976 provides copyright owners the exclusive 
right to reproduce, make adaptations, distribute, publicly display, and pub-
licly perform their works.115 Since photographing a three-dimensional copy-
righted work results in a reproduction and adaptation of that work, photo-
graphing a Waterford vase, even for the purpose of posting the photograph 
in an advertisement selling the lamp, would theoretically infringe on the 
copyright owner’s reproduction and adaptation right, and avail the copy-
right owner of the Section 512 take-down provisions.116 
There are, however several limitations on these exclusive rights,117 in-
cluding one which protects such activities. Congress created a narrow ex-
ception to the exclusive reproduction and adaptation rights in copyrighted 
   
17 U.S.C. § 512(c)(1) (2006). The written notification required under § 512(c)(1)(C) must include 
(among other requirements): 
 
(ii) [i]dentification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed . . .  
(iii) [i]dentification of the material that is claimed to be infringing . . . that is to be re-
moved . . . and information reasonably sufficient to permit the service provider to locate 
the material.

of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an ex-

  117  The Copyright Act grants the owner of the copyright the exclusive rights of reproduction, 
adaptation, distribution, public performance, public display, and digital broadcasts of sound recordings. 
See 17 U.S.C. § 106 (2006). However, there are several exceptions to these exclusive rights, such as fair 
use (§ 107), first sale (§ 109) and compulsory licenses (§ 115). 2012]  THE MARK OF A RESOLD GOOD  175 
works that have been lawfully reproduced in “useful article[s],” such as a 
lamp, or an article of clothing.118 Section 113(c) of the Act declares that it is 
not an infringement of the reproduction right119 for others to make and dis-
tribute pictures or photos of a useful article, such as our hypothetical Tiffa-
ny lamp, in connection with ads or commentaries related to the distribution 
or display of such articles, so long as the lamp has been offered for sale or 
distributed to the public.120 Consequently, it is lawful for a furniture store to 
feature a picture in a news ad or catalog of the lamp whose base is a statue, 
even though that would involve making a two-dimensional photographic 
reproduction of the statue. And, despite MLB’s protestations, it was lawful 
as a matter of copyright law for Karen Dudnikov to display a photograph of 
MLB-logo items on her listing web page.121 Since the photographs may be 
used to advertise goods for sale, this use should not expose the reseller to 
trademark infringement liability; otherwise Section 113 of the Copyright 
Act is meaningless.122  
Yet mark owners persist in bullying resellers to remove photographs 
of their items from websites based on a trademark likelihood of confusion 
claim, eviscerating the exception delineated in Section 113.123 For example, 
Standard Process separately sued two resellers of dietary supplements—
Total Health Discount124 and chiropractor Scott J. Banks125—for trademark 
infringement, based in part on their use of photographs of Standard Pro-
cess’s products that were being resold online by the defendants.126  
Standard Process sent cease-and-desist letters to the two defendants, 
stating  that  use  of  Standard  Process’s  photographs  violated  trademark 
law,127  and  the  defendants  complied  by  removing  the  product  photo-

commentaries related to the distribution or display of such articles, or in connection with news re-
ports.”). 
  121  See id. Of course this presupposes that the manufacture of the utilitarian article is a lawful 
reproduction of the work. If the maker of the lamps never secured permission to use the statues as lamp 
bases, then the Section 113(c) exception does not apply. Id.

graphs.128 Yet in addition to Section 113, the trademark first sale doctrine 
includes the ability to “stock, display, and resell”; posting photographs of 
products online amounts to displaying the products.129 There was no reason 
the defendants should have removed the photographs. Their removal, ac-
cording to Professor Rebecca Tushnet, is “caving to bullying” and unwar-
ranted.130  
Since the first sale doctrine was originally borrowed from copyright 
law,131 courts should consider that, since copyright law does not limit the 
right to use photographs of copyrighted material to advertise the sale of 
useful articles,132 the same use should be not be grounds for a trademark 
infringement claim. The evident purpose is to allow further sales in com-
merce,133 and  the  same  limitation should be  recognized  with regard to 
trademark infringement claims. Moreover, product photographs can actual-
ly help mark owners identify counterfeit products.134 So, ironically, by cre-
ating an environment in which product photographs cause liability, mark 
owners make it even more difficult—for themselves and consumers—to 
identify counterfeit products.135 
Of course, a major motive for removing photographs from the re-
seller’s auction listings is that this will hurt sales. “[D]etailed information 
and photographs . . . help entice buyers.”136 eBay even lists as one of its

   15. Based upon information and belief, the defendant aggressively protects the copyright-
ed images. These actions include policing of flea markets, craft shows, craft malls, and Inter-
net auctions sites. At crafts shows and flea markets, when hand-crafted items are found that 
use the fabrics portraying the copyrighted images owned by the defendant, cease and desist 
letters are distributed. On the auction sites, the auctions featuring similar fabric items are 
terminated at the request of the defendant.  
   16. Based upon information and belief, Disney counsel knows, or reasonably should 
know, the fabric items are not derivatives as defined by federal courts, federal law and rec-
ognized authorities on copyrights. The intimidation tactics used by Disney are therefore ille-
gal and immoral. They rely on the fact people can’t fight back because of the potential enor-
mous legal expense. 
   17. Based upon information and belief, on September 4, 2002, the defendant requested 
eBay® terminate three auction listing [sic] by Tabberone, falsely alleging to eBay® in an af-
fidavit that the articles offered on these auctions were infringing items.

auctions were terminated because the fabric items were considered to be derivatives and 
therefore infringing upon the copyrights held by the defendant.

in her creations: 
 
 178  GEO. MASON L. REV.  [VOL. 20:1 
backed down and agreed that Ms. Dudnikov’s creations from licensed Dis-
ney fabric were not infringing uses.141 Disney claimed copyright infringe-
ment to shut down her eBay auction, yet Disney’s objection to Ms. Dudni-
kov displaying her crafts on her website was in direct conflict with the ex-
emption under Section 113.142 Thus, despite a demonstrably false copyright 
infringement claim, manufacturers such as Disney attempt to use the take-
down provisions in Section 512 of the Copyright Act to remove online auc-
tion items listings.143  
Misusing copyright and trademark law points to a single objective: to 
decrease the competition of secondary markets.144 Small dealers are faced 
with either defending themselves or ceasing operations.145 And as previous-
ly discussed, even when a successful defense is likely, the costs of such 
litigation can be prohibitively expensive, and even the threat of litigation 
leads the secondary market merchants to abandon their online ventures.146 
   
   22. The defendant, directly and through licensees, has released innumerable different cop-
yrighted fabrics in the last few years through an estimated ten thousand national fabric out-
lets including Wal-Mart, Hancock Fabrics, and Joann Fabrics. It was the intention of the de-
fendant that the fabric be cut, shaped, and sewn into fabric items such as pillows, bedding, 
wearing apparel, accessories, etc. There is no other purpose for selling uncut fabric. 
   23. The Plaintiffs lawfully purchased the copyrighted fabric from retail outlet sources. 
Since the plaintiffs use of the copyrighted fabric was consistent with the intended purpose of 
the sale of the fabric, the subsequent sales of the fabric items falls wholly under the First Sale 
Doctrine.

D.  Further Pursuits 
In addition to attacking resellers, in their aggressive pursuit to shut 
down the Internet resale market, mark owners have also taken their fight to 
ISPs and online auction sites, alleging contributory infringement based on 
resellers’ use of these sites to advertise the mark owners’ goods.147 The Su-
preme Court has held that 
[e]ven if a manufacturer does not directly control others in the chain of distribution, it can be 
held responsible for their infringing activities under certain circumstances. . . . [I]f a manu-
facturer or distributor intentionally induces another to infringe a trademark, or if it continues 
to supply its product to one whom it knows or has reason to know is engaging in trademark 
infringement, the manufacturer or distributor is contributorially responsible for any harm 
done as a result of the deceit. 148 
In their suits, mark owners allege that auction sites are not doing 
enough to stop counterfeiters; however, the mark owners also have the ob-
jective of removing genuine goods from this alternative distribution chan-
nel.149 For example, in 2002, Tiffany & Co., the well-known jewelry com-
pany, began pressuring eBay to summarily remove Tiffany goods that met 
some general criteria—such as merchants selling more than five items—
alleging that any Tiffany items sold in bulk outside Tiffany’s normal distri-
bution chain had to be counterfeit.150 When eBay refused to do so, Tiffany 
sued, contending that eBay was “facilitating and advertising the sale of 
‘Tiffany’ goods that turned out to be counterfeit.” 151  
eBay was successful in defending both direct and indirect infringement 
claims based on the defenses of nominative fair use152 and lack of control 
over the merchants who use the site.153 The Second Circuit declined to find 
eBay contributorily liable, stating “that eBay’s practice was promptly to 
remove the challenged listing from its website, warn sellers and buyers, 
   
  147  See, e.g., Tiffany (NJ) Inc. v. eBay, Inc., 600 F.3d 93, 101 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 131 S. Ct. 647 
(2010). 
  148  Inwood Labs., Inc. v. Ives Labs., Inc. 456 U.S. 844, 853-54 (1982). 
  149  See, e.g., Tiffany, 600 F.3d at 98. 
  150  This allegation was rejected by both the district court and on appeal. Id. at 109 n.13. 
  151  Id. at 101. Tiffany claimed these actions “constituted direct and contributory trademark in-
fringement, trademark dilution, and false advertising.” Id. 
  152  Id. at 103 (agreeing “with the district court that eBay’s use of Tiffany's mark on its website and 
in sponsored links was lawful. eBay used the mark to describe accurately the genuine Tiffany goods 
offered for sale on its website. And none of eBay’s uses of the mark suggested that Tiffany affiliated 
itself with eBay or endorsed the sale of its products through eBay’s website.”). 
  153  Id. at 106, 109 (holding that eBay was not contributorially liable because it had not continued 
“to supply its [service] to one whom it knows or has reason to know is engaging in trademark infringe-
ment” (quoting Inwood Labs., Inc., 456 U.S. at 854)). 180  GEO. MASON L. REV.  [VOL. 20:1 
cancel fees it earned from that listing, and direct buyers not to consummate 
the sale of the disputed item.”154  
While the court found that eBay did possess general knowledge that 
counterfeit items were listed on its website, it held that under the Supreme 
Court  test  outlined  in  Inwood  Laboratories,  Inc.  v.  Ives  Laboratories, 
Inc.,155 generalized knowledge was not sufficient “to impose upon eBay an 
affirmative duty to remedy the problem.”156 Other websites have also suc-
cessfully defended themselves against similar suits.157  
In spite of winning in court, these websites want to avoid suits for con-
tributory infringement, and will take an unnecessarily strong conservative 
approach regarding accused listings.158 The hosts want to ensure that they 
are viewed merely as “conduits” between the buyer and seller with no direct 
control over the listed goods,159 and will usually remove listings based on 
any accusation by the mark owner.160 If it is later proved (by the entity list-
ing the good for sale) that it is indeed a genuine good and there is no confu-
sion as to “distribution channel” affiliation, the item is relisted.161 This cycle

goods time, money, and frustration162 and creates added burdens to both the 
reseller and the auction site, stifling the sale of goods for both parties.163 
Under the eBay model, every time an item is listed, the auction site earns a 
fee, and another fee is earned when the item is sold.164 Yet when a “take 
down” occurs, the listing fee is returned to the seller, depriving the host of 
the fee for a legitimate good.165 If the reseller eventually gives up due to the 
burden of constantly having to defend legitimate auction listings to the host, 
then both the reseller and the host lose the income that is generated from the 
listing and sale of the good.166

would give auction hosting sites less concern over potential lawsuits by 
mark owners who don’t like their items being sold outside their authorized 
distribution channels.167

III.  GETTING DEFENSIVE 
It has been repeatedly acknowledged that the producer of a good can-
not prevent others from using the good’s mark to truthfully describe the 
good.168 This basic belief is the foundation for both nominative fair use and 
first sale defenses, and “reflects the simple insight that anybody should be 
free to refer to goods and services by their brand names.”169 
A.  Repackaged, Repaired, Resold 
There are several ways to use another’s mark in commerce which do 
not constitute infringement. These include, among others,170 (1) the vendor 
is selling repackaged goods; (2) the vendor is selling used or repaired 
goods; (3) or the vendor is reselling a genuine good.171  
While using a mark to identify repackaged goods may be done in a 
non-infringing way, the repackager does not receive absolute protection 
under the first sale doctrine—the repackaging “can present a non-trivial 
harm to the producer’s good will, and can deceive consumers who, in addi-
tion to identifying the trademark, have come to expect or rely upon a par-
ticular type of packaging in their purchasing decisions.”172 
When a “reseller’s repackaging interferes with the trademark owner’s 
ability to control the quality of its products . . . two harms can arise: harm to 
the consuming public in the form of deception and harm to the trademark 
owner in the form of loss of [good will].”173 Consequently, as packaging 
becomes more and more important in swaying a potential consumer’s pur-
chasing decision, shoddy packaging may cause increasing harm to the mark 
owner’s good will, resulting in a higher likelihood of trademark infringe-
ment liability.174 
In order to avoid Lanham Act liability, when sellers purchase genuine 
goods and then repackage the goods for resale, these resellers generally

  170  Other defenses that are not relevant to this Article include comparative fair use, 15 U.S.C. §

ly New Kids on the Block, 971 F.2d at 306-07 (defining comparative and descriptive fair use); Burger

use of a registered mark).

  173  Id. at 402. 
  174  Id. at 401-02. Mr. Swindells argues for a repackaging exception to the first sale/exhaustion 
doctrine. See id. at 409-16. 2012]  THE MARK OF A RESOLD GOOD  183 
must (1) disclose that they have repackaged the goods; (2) include their 
own name; (3) provide notice on the package that they are not affiliated 
with the manufacturer; and (4) must not give “undue prominence” to the 
good’s mark.175 These rules for repackaged goods illustrate the underlying 
philosophy governing all sellers and resellers—an obligation to tell the truth 
regarding the source of the goods.176  
Other resellers repair goods and then resell them with the original 
trademark on the goods or the packaging.177 A reseller who is selling a re-
paired good “has the right to resell the original product with the original 
trademark attached, as long as he tells the truth about the origin of the re-
paired goods and about his responsibility for any repairs.”178 And just as a 
reseller must state that repackaged goods have been repackaged, a reseller 
of repaired goods must state that they have been repaired.179 At some point, 
however, repairs may be so extensive that the product “cannot properly be 
considered the same any longer”180 and the mark no longer truthfully de-
scribes the goods attached to it. 
B.  Trademark Nominative Fair Use 
Supposedly, “[u]se of the mark alone is not sufficiently probative of” 
an intent to deceive the public into believing that the mark owner endorsed 
or somehow supported the defendant’s products or services.181 Accordingly, 
   
  175  SCHECHTER & THOMAS, supra note 44, § 31.1.2, at 731. In the foundational nominative fair use 
case of Prestonettes, Inc. v. Coty, the Supreme Court recognized that when a “mark is used in a way that 
does not deceive the public,” there is “no such sanctity in the word as to prevent its being used to tell the 
truth.” Prestonettes, Inc. v. Coty, 264 U.S. 359, 368 (1924); see also Enesco Corp. v. Price/Costco Inc., 
146 F.3d 1083, 1086 (9th Cir. 1998) (holding that providing notice that a good was repackaged is neces-
sary to prevent customer confusion).

cases, used and repaired goods can be sold under the trademark of the original manufacturer, without 
‘deceiv[ing] the public,’ so long as the accused infringer had attempted to restore ‘so far as possible’ the

ple, as ‘used’ or ‘repaired.’” (alteration in original) (quoting Champion Spark Plug Co. v. Sanders, 331

or ‘repaired’ were added.”).

nominative fair uses are actions outside of trademark law,182 and a defend-
ant has a right to use a plaintiff’s mark to truthfully describe the plaintiff’s 
goods using the plaintiff’s mark.183 In his opinion in New Kids on the Block, 
Judge Alex Kozinski declared that courts 
may generalize a class of cases where the use of the trademark does not attempt to capitalize 
on consumer confusion or to appropriate the cachet of one product for a different one. Such 
nominative use of a mark—where the only word reasonably available to describe a particular 
thing is pressed into service—lies outside the strictures of trademark law: Because it does not 
implicate the source-identification function that is the purpose of trademark, it does not con-
stitute unfair competition; such use is fair because it does not imply sponsorship or endorse-
ment by the trademark holder.184 
Yet in spite of its 20-year history, the nominative fair use defense has 
mostly been confined to the Third, Fifth, and Ninth Circuits, and is not well 
understood in any of them.185 Indeed, in the Ninth Circuit, nominative fair 
use is not an affirmative defense; rather, it replaces likelihood of confusion 
in the plaintiff’s prima facie case.186 The Ninth Circuit declares that, in as-
serting nominative fair use, a defendant “need only show that it used the 
mark to refer to the trademarked good,”187 having the burden of proving that 
(1) the product or service in question is one not readily identifiable without 
the use of the trademark; and (2) only so much of the mark is used as is 
reasonably necessary to identify the product or service.188 “The burden then 
reverts to the plaintiff to show a likelihood of confusion,”189 that the user 
has acted in a way “that would, in conjunction with the mark, suggest spon-
sorship or endorsement by the trademark holder.” 190 As noted supra, this

places a burden of proving likelihood of confusion . . . on the party charging infringement even when 
relying on an incontestable registration. And Congress said nothing about likelihood of confusion in 
setting out the elements of the fair use defense in § 1115(b)(4). . . . [I]t takes a long stretch to claim that 
a defense of fair use entails any burden to negate confusion.”). 
  190  New Kids on the Block, 971 F.2d at 308. 2012]  THE MARK OF A RESOLD GOOD  185 
final prong is “a substitute for the usual likelihood-of-confusion analysis”191 
and “amounts to a requirement of good faith [on the part of the defendant], 
denying protection . . . to anyone who attempts to use a trademark to con-
fuse the public.”192 
The Fifth Circuit recommends—without requiring—that courts evalu-
ate likelihood of confusion and nominative fair use simultaneously.193 In 
contrast, in 2005, the Third Circuit designed its own two-step version of 
nominative fair use, whereby the plaintiff must prove likelihood of confu-
sion under a modified likelihood-of-confusion test, which removes factors 
that are not appropriate in the context of nominative fair use.194 This replac-
es the third part of the Ninth Circuit’s test, instead asking whether “the de-
fendant’s conduct or language reflect the true and accurate relationship be-
tween plaintiff and defendant’s products or services.”195 The burden then 
shifts to the defendant to show that its use is fair, under the court’s own 
three-part nominative fair use test.196 
The First, Second, and Sixth Circuits have either rejected or declined 
to adopt nominative fair use,197 and other courts have yet to decide on its 
adoption or rejection.198 Yet in spite of this limited acceptance, nominative

fair use is mentioned, albeit without a definition, in the Trademark Dilution 
Revision Act of 2006.199 
The nominative fair use defense has been criticized for its analytical 
defects. As noted by Professor McGeveran, “[n]ominative fair use as it now 
exists has become ungainly and often unhelpful.”200 Professor McGeveran 
argues that there are three major issues with how courts apply a nominative 
fair use analysis.201 First, the analysis typically occurs late in the litigation 
process rather than early in the process, when many defenses are adjudicat-
ed.202 The second issue arises when courts 
become entangled in a foolish preliminary inquiry of asking whether the nominative fair use 
doctrine, rather than section 33(b)(4) [descriptive fair use], applies to particular facts. The 
third and most significant problem. . . is the collapse of the requirements for nominative fair 
use into a substitute likelihood of confusion analysis in a way that actually prejudices fair us-
es and further prolongs litigation.203  
Professor McGeveran also argues that “[t]his substitution also shifts 
burdens unfairly. Nominative use was not designed as a means to determine 
ultimate liability, but as a mechanism to set aside cases that fall outside the 
bounds of trademark law.”204 He evinces the Ninth Circuit’s use of the doc-

trine in a way that eviscerates nominative fair use’s usefulness.205 “Instead 
of serving as an early ‘gatekeeper’ that can screen out fair uses and reduce 
the length and cost of litigation, nominative fair use becomes just another 
fact-intensive confusion inquiry that may be brought only after extensive 
discovery.”206 
Professor Graeme B. Dinwoodie likewise concludes that “the third 
part of the [Ninth Circuit’s] test looks very much a proxy for an assessment 
of likely confusion as to association, sponsorship or endorsement.”207 Pro-
fessor Dinwoodie suggests “that it is time to treat nominative fair use as an 
autonomous and real defense, rather than simply a reformulation of the test 
for likely confusion.”208  
Similarly, in his treatise, Professor Thomas McCarthy queries how the 
third part of the test  
differs from the ultimate issue that the three part test is supposed to facilitate: is there a like-
lihood of confusion? If it is not to be simply a repetition of the ultimate issue, . . . the third 
factor should be viewed as asking whether, in addition to mere use of the mark, defendant 
has engaged in some additional conduct that affirmatively suggests sponsorship or endorse-
ment by the plaintiff.209  
These criticisms appear well-founded because some courts indeed evaluate 
the third part of the nominative fair use test using the same factors they use 
for likelihood of confusion.210 Indeed, there should be some degree of con-
fusion allowed without foreclosing that a defendant’s use is objectively 
fair.211 Professor McGeveran succinctly summarizes the confused and inad-
equate state of the nominative fair use defense: 
[C]ourts have gradually larded up the simple idea of nominative fair use presented in New 
Kids to the point where it is excessively complex and minimally useful. By moving the doc-
trine away from any role as an early screening mechanism and closer in timing and substance 
   
  205  See generally id. at 88-97 (discussing the normative fair use doctrine). 
  206  Id. at 91. McGeveran notes that “[t]he Ninth Circuit has explicitly transformed nominative fair 
use into a substitute for the traditional test to judge likelihood of confusion. This shift—from regarding 
nominative fair use as a threshold showing or a defense to approaching it as an alternate standard for the 
plaintiff’s prima facie case—vitiated most of its usefulness.” Id.

Thus, this muddled application of nominative fair use has adversely af-

Weber to truthfully describe their goods.213 This unfairly strengthens mark 
owners’ control over distribution channels for their goods beyond the initial

The nominative fair use defense usually concerns comparative adver-

and  in  some  way  refers  to  the  mark  owner’s  goods.216  Under  first 
sale/exhaustion—which could be considered a variation of nominative fair 
use—the defendant does not use the plaintiff’s mark in an effort to sell her 
own goods, but rather uses the plaintiff’s mark to refer to the plaintiff’s 
goods, albeit with the intention of selling the plaintiff’s goods.217 The first 
sale doctrine is based on the principle that trademark owners should not be 
able to control downstream sales of their goods.218

The rules governing the protection of trademarks are intended to prevent the diversion of 
trade or harm to reputation that is likely to result if consumers are confused as to the source 
or sponsorship of goods and services. Confusion does not occur, however, when a trademark 
is used to identify genuine goods marketed under that mark by the trademark owner. Thus, 
the trademark owner cannot ordinarily prevent or control the sale of goods bearing the mark 
once the owner has permitted those goods to enter commerce. It can be said that the rights of 
the trademark owner are exhausted once the owner authorizes the initial sale of the product 
 2012]  THE MARK OF A RESOLD GOOD  189 
While first sale is legislatively created in the Copyright Act,219 trade-
mark and patent first sale (or exhaustion) affirmative defenses are long-
recognized judicial constructs.220 All three, however, serve a similar pur-
pose: to “narrow[] the rights of the creator of intellectual property by creat-
ing competition between the creator and the reseller of the work.”221 As 
noted supra,222 the Supreme Court has recognized as early as 1924 that, 
even though it results in the secondary market merchant getting some ad-
vantage from the mark, a mark may be used by a refurbisher or reseller of a 
good in a way that does not deceive the public.223 Under the exhaustion doc-
trine,  
   
under the trademark or that the owner implicitly licenses others to further market the goods 
under the mark. Thus, no infringement occurs when the use of a mark properly identifies the 
source, sponsorship, or certification of the goods or services, even if the owner of the mark 
objects to the use.

    One significant limitation on the first sale doctrine is that it only applies to unaltered or “genu-
ine goods,” unless the consumer has reason to know of the alterations. Therefore, using the mark in 
connection with the resale of a materially different product is trademark infringement. Davidoff & Cie, 
S.A. v. PLD Int’l Corp., 263 F.3d 1297, 1302 (11th Cir. 2001). First Sale and nominative fair use de-
fenses are inapplicable for altered goods, because “[a] materially different product is not genuine and 
may generate consumer confusion about the source and the quality of the trademarked product.” Bel-
tronics USA, Inc. v. Midwest Inventory Distrib., LLC, 562 F.3d 1067, 1072 (10th Cir. 2009). In Bel-
tronics, the Tenth Circuit stated that a difference is material if a consumer would consider the difference 
relevant in the decision to purchase the product. Id. at 1073. These differences are not limited to the 
physical product; they may include warranties and “service commitments.” Id. Yet “[t]he purpose of the 
material difference test is to assist courts in determining whether allegedly infringing products are likely 
 190  GEO. MASON L. REV.  [VOL. 20:1 
[t]he resale of genuine trademarked goods generally does not constitute infringement. This is 
for the simple reason that consumers are not confused as to the origin of the goods: the origin 
has not changed as a result of the resale. . . . [T]he trademark protections of the Lanham Act 
are exhausted after the trademark owner’s first authorized sale of that product. Therefore, 
even though a subsequent sale is without a trademark owner’s consent, the resale of a genu-
ine good does not violate the Act.224 
It reflects a general public policy against restraints on alienation.225 
The  Southern  District  of  New  York  quite  recently  reaffirmed  this 
longstanding principle in Bel Canto Design, Ltd. v. MSS HiFi, Inc.226—“as a 
general matter, trademark law does not reach the sale of genuine goods 
bearing a true mark even though the sale is not authorized by the mark 
owner.”227 The court reaffirmed that the “Lanham Act does not give mark 
owners the right to control subsequent, non-authorized resales, as long as 
the product sold is genuine.”228 In her opinion, Judge Colleen McMahon 
cites the long history in the Second Circuit recognizing that “the unauthor-
   
to cause confusion . . . and undermine the [good will] the trademark owner has developed . . . .” Id. at 
1074. Therefore, material differences by themselves may not trigger liability. In other words, because 
the critical issue remains likelihood of confusion, material differences will not cause liability for trade-
mark infringement as long as the seller dispels potential confusion by sufficiently disclosing material 
differences to the buyer. Id. The premise of first sale is that the consumers are getting exactly what they 
bargained for. S&L Vitamins, Inc. v. Austl. Gold, Inc., 521 F. Supp. 2d 188, 202 (E.D.N.Y. 2007); see

ized sale of a trademarked article does not, without more, constitute a Lan-
ham Act violation.”229 
Thus, a reseller has the right to dispose of genuine goods that were 
originally produced under the authority of the mark owner, provided that 
the goods are not materially altered and the reseller does not give the im-
pression it is affiliated with the manufacturer.230 “Resale by the first pur-
chaser of the original article under the producer’s trademark is neither 
trademark infringement nor unfair competition.”231 Because reselling the 
manufacturer’s product can lead to some confusion as to the connection 
between the mark owner and the reseller, the first sale defense should not 
be  
rendered inapplicable merely because consumers erroneously believe the reseller is affiliated 
with or authorized by the producer. It is the essence of the “first sale” doctrine that a pur-
chaser who does no more than stock, display, and resell a producer’s product under the pro-
ducer’s trademark violates no right conferred upon the producer by the Lanham Act. When a 
purchaser resells a trademarked article under the producer’s trademark, and nothing more, 
there is no actionable misrepresentation under the statute.232 
Courts should tolerate more confusion than they typically do where the 
defendant is using a mark similar to the plaintiff’s to sell the defendant’s 
own goods.233 As noted by David Barnes, courts tend to treat first sale “as 
an affirmative defense to what would otherwise be an infringement of the 
creator’s rights . . . [and] the trademark defendant has the burden of proving 
that it was reselling genuine and lawfully acquired goods.”234 However, it is 
the plaintiff’s burden under the Lanham Act to establish likelihood of con-

The trademark first sale/exhaustion principle supposedly extends to a 
reseller’s use of a mark in cyberspace.237 This means that “[a] retailer can 
use a brand name on Web site ads selling that branded product without a 
license from the trademark owner,”238 so long as the reseller does not mis-
lead the consumer into believing that the reseller is an authorized dealer of 
the brand.239 Deceptiveness as to affiliation between the reseller and the

firmative defense of descriptive fair use has no independent burden to show no likelihood of confusion); 
see also Barnes, supra note 87, at 465-67. 
 
Proof of genuineness of the goods being resold is intimately linked to the question of wheth-
er there is likely to be confusion about the source of the goods. If the goods are genuine, 
there can be no confusion because the trademark appearing on the goods correctly identifies 
the manufacturer. The plaintiff in a trademark suit clearly has the burden of showing that a 
likelihood of confusing arises from the defendant’s conduct.

mark owner could also be better handled through a claim of false advertis-
ing.240 After all, courts have consistently held that 
[a]fter the first sale, the brandholder's control is deemed exhausted. Down-the-line retailers 
are free to display and advertise the branded goods. Secondhand dealers may advertise the 
branded merchandise for resale in competition with the sales of the markholder (so long as 
they do not misrepresent themselves as authorized agents).241  
Exhaustion should apply equally to online sales as it does to brick-and-
mortar stores.242 Courts, however do not always do so, and—as discussed 
below—by supporting plaintiffs’ claims of trademark infringement, they 
extend control over the distribution channels of goods beyond the initial 
sale.243  
IV.  CHALLENGING THE MARK OWNER’S DESIRE FOR TOTAL CONTROL 
As illustrated supra, there is a need for comprehensive and definitive 
trademark nominative fair use and first sale doctrines with regard to online 
resale of genuine goods, along with more leeway regarding initial interest 
confusion related to distribution affiliation.244 Our solutions are supported 
by recent trademark scholarship advocating the need for a showing of actu-
al injury, rather than “merely a benefit to someone else.”245 
   
  240  See generally Lemley & McKenna, supra note 16, at 444-45. Professors Mark Lemley and 
Mark McKenna propose importing into trademark law the materiality requirement courts have created in 
the false advertising context and applying it in any case based on confusion that does not relate to source 
or control over quality.  
 
Plaintiffs bringing cases then would face a choice: (1) bring a trademark infringement claim 
and be required to prove confusion regarding actual source or responsibility for the quality of 
the defendant’s goods or services; or (2) bring a false advertising-type claim alleging that the 
use causes some other form of confusion and be required to prove confusion about that rela-
tionship and that such confusion materially affects consumers’ decisions whether to purchase 
the defendant’s goods or services.

 194  GEO. MASON L. REV.  [VOL. 20:1 
A.  Strengthening Available Defenses 
In line with this current advocacy seeking to eliminate claims where 
there is no confusion as to source or responsibility or material confusion,246 
this Article proposes more specific solutions with regard to Internet re-
sellers. There is a need for either the courts or Congress to rebalance the 
scales regarding trademark rights to prevent continued control by mark 
owners of the distribution of their products beyond the first sale.247 Howev-
er, “[a]bsent congressional action, courts have only a limited ability to cor-
rect the imbalance between trademark liability and defenses.”248 For a legis-
lative solution that would protect resellers of genuine goods without affect-
ing a mark owner’s ability to remove counterfeit goods from the market-
place, Congress could add language to the Lanham Act which (1) codifies 
trademark first sale and nominative fair use as defenses under Section 
33(b); (2) eliminates the controversial claim of initial interest confusion 
regarding the sale of genuine goods; and (3) specifies a requirement of de-
ceptive intent regarding distribution affiliation confusion for it to be an ac-
tionable claim.249 This would generate uniformity among the circuits regard-
ing nominative fair use, initial interest confusion, and the robustness of the 
first sale doctrine with regard to trademarks. Professor Michael Grynberg 
notes that when Congress passed the Trademark Anti-Dilution Act, it “en-
act[ed] specific safe harbors for activities that are unlikely to cause confu-
sion or those that may cause confusion, but whose social utility is high 
enough that the benefits of immunizing the acts outweigh any costs.”250 
Since the trademark exhaustion doctrine has its roots in copyright 
law,251 an amendment to the Lanham Act could mimic Section 109 of the

Copyright Act.252 Similar language would provide uniformity across these 
two often-times related intellectual property claims. As discussed earlier, 
copyright and trademark infringement are often asserted in the same law-
suit.253 If Lanham Act language clearly stated that the same first sale excep-
tion which applied for copyright also applied for the use of the mark at-
tached to the goods, this would give resellers more certainty in their use of 
the mark owner’s brand when identifying the mark owner’s goods during 
resale.  
This solution should lead to less litigation; however unless damages 
for frivolous suits are allowed, it may not stop the reality of cease-and-
desist letters and threatened litigation.254 Penalties for threats of frivolous 
litigation are common, and are part of anti-trust law,255 first amendment

the owner of a particular copy or phonorecord lawfully made under this title . . . is entitled,

B.  Expect Some Confusion 
As noted supra, courts should move back towards their “traditional 
willingness to permit a considerable degree of confusion in order to leave 
room” for competition.259 Professor Jennifer E. Rothman contends that, with 
regard to metatags, domain names, and search engines, 
[t]he initial interest confusion doctrine. . . conflicts with specific well-established principles 
in trademark law. Trademark law, like copyright and patent law, provides that a consumer 
who purchases a good can freely resell that good without committing trademark infringe-
ment. Being able to resell goods necessitates the ability to advertise the sale of such goods. 
The initial interest confusion doctrine severely limits the freedom of consumers to resell 
products.260  
More broadly, Professor Glynn Lunney argues that, “we must limit ac-
tionable confusion to cases where, if the use is allowed to continue, a sub-
stantial number of purchasers or prospective purchasers will actually be-
come confused concerning information that will materially influence their 
buying decisions.”261 As such, this Article argues that, unless the mark own-
er can show actual deception on the part of the reseller, as a general rule 
plaintiffs should not be allowed to claim initial interest confusion with re-
gard to alternative distribution channels of genuine goods.262 First, as long 
   
costs and attorneys’ fees, incurred by the alleged infringer . . . who is injured by such misrepresenta-
tion.”). 
  258  Though it would do little to prevent the sending of threatening cease-and-desist letters, this 
matter is a problem faced by copyright and patent defendants as well and not an issue that will be dis-
cussed in this Article. See Marketa Trimble, Setting Foot on Enemy Ground: Cease-and-Desist Letters, 
DMCA Notifications and Personal Jurisdiction in Declaratory Judgment Actions, 50 IDEA 777, 786-87 
(2010). 
  259  Lunney, supra note 19, at 385. Cf. Grynberg, supra note 18, at 963 (“Congress could . . . give 
judges explicit authority to devise and apply flexible defenses to trademark liability when circumstances 
warrant. In much the same way Congress amended the Copyright Act to incorporate the fair use doc-
trine, previously a common law creation, it could legislate a similarly open-ended standard for judges to 
apply in the trademark realm. Alternatively, Congress could follow the model of the FTC Act and create 
a standard that contains some guidance for courts to follow in determining whether to excuse purported-
ly infringing conduct.” (footnote omitted)).

that “due to the ease with which the consumer could return to the search results posted by the search 
 2012]  THE MARK OF A RESOLD GOOD  197 
as there is no deception on the part of the reseller, any confusion as to “dis-
tribution channel” affiliation ends prior to the sale of the good.263 Second, as 
noted earlier, many consumers visit sites like eBay and Craigslist for the 
purpose of finding genuine goods at lower costs than they would expect to 
find when buying directly from the mark owner or an authorized retailer.264 
Indeed, when a product is subject to first sale doctrine and the nomina-
tive fair use that accompanies it, some confusion should be expected. The 
Supreme Court declared in KP Permanent Make-Up, Inc. v. Lasting Im-
pressions I, Inc.265 that, “[s]ince the burden of proving likelihood of confu-
sion rests with the plaintiff, and the fair use defendant has no free-standing 
need to show confusion unlikely, it follows . . . that some possibility of con-
sumer confusion must be compatible with fair use, and so it is.”266  
Any initial confusion to the resale of a genuine good is related to the 
distribution source, not to the good itself; a claim of initial interest confu-
sion should be a spurious allegation.267 An assertion of confusion as to the 
distributor’s affiliation should be discounted—after all, there is no confu-
sion as to the source of the good; the mark owner is truthfully the source of 
the good. And to hold a defendant liable for infringement where there may 
only be initial confusion as to whether the distribution channel is associated 
with the mark owner results in the mark owner controlling subsequent sales 
of his or her product.268  
Although  courts  have  declared  that  “[a]ffiliation  confusion  exists 
where use of a ‘unique and recognizable identifier’ could lead consumers to 
‘infer a relationship’ between the  trademark owner and the new prod-
uct[,]”269 this should not apply to the distribution of the goods after the ini-
tial sale, but rather only to the good itself. Otherwise, a finding of initial 
interest affiliation confusion because the seller is not affiliated with the 
mark owner would eviscerate any protection afforded through trademark 
law’s first sale/exhaustion principle.270 
   
engine . . . so called internet initial confusion requires a showing of intentional deception on the part of 
the defendant before imposing liability”). 
  263  See, e.g., Lemley & McKenna, supra note 16, at 448 (proposing that sponsorship or affiliation 
confusion should only be actionable if “they (1) are false or misleading and (2) materially affect con-
sumer decisions”). 
  264  See Goldman, supra note 14, at 522-24 (discussing how search users can have a variety of 
reasons for the use of trademark search terms, including finding distribution sources other than those 
authorized by the mark owner).

  270  Rothman, supra note 14, at 140. 198  GEO. MASON L. REV.  [VOL. 20:1 
Because of the controversial nature of the claim, we should question 
whether initial interest affiliation confusion matters at all with regard to the 
secondary sale of goods. Courts have found such a claim spurious. In her 
concurrence  in  Playboy  Enterprises,  Inc.  v.  Netscape  Communications 
Corp.,271 Judge Marsha Berzon contended that it was not “reasonable to find 
initial interest confusion when a consumer is never confused as to source or 
affiliation, but instead knows, or should know, from the outset that a prod-
uct or web link is not related to that of the trademark holder because the list 
produced by the search engine so informs him.”272 Yet this form of confu-
sion has been successfully asserted in Internet resale cases.273 Juries and 
judges have supported a finding of infringement based on initial interest 
affiliation confusion as to the distribution channel of the good,274 and have 
often discounted any first sale or nominative fair use defense.275 Judges and 
juries seem to hold Internet sales to a different standard than consignment 
and resale shops in the brick-and-mortar world, where a plaintiff would face 
a much higher hurdle to show customer confusion with regard to distribu-
tion affiliation.276 
There should be a presumption of non-infringement when a product’s 
brand is used in the advertising for the reselling of an item—including in 
the description of it or use of a photograph of the item in an online sale. 
This presumption would shift the burden of proof—rather than the reseller-
defendant asserting nominative fair use as an affirmative defense, the plain-
tiff would have to overcome this presumption as part of his or her prima 
facie case.277 
Without a proven deception by the reseller, confusion as to affiliation 
with regard to distribution channels should be negated by the fact that the 
goods in question are genuine goods, and there is no confusion as to the 
actual source of the goods. As Justice Antonin Scalia stated in Dastar Corp. 
v. Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp.,278 “[t]he words of the Lanham Act 
should not be stretched to cover matters that are typically of no conse-
quence to purchasers.”279 As long as the goods are genuine, we must even 
question whether the purchaser is initially confused regarding the reseller’s 
lack of affiliation with the mark owner.280 Indeed, when looking even more

generally at sponsorship or affiliation confusion, Professors Lemley and 
McKenna provide a strong argument that the “point is not that consumers 
can never be harmed by confusion regarding non-quality-related relation-
ships. Rather, the point is that the sort of attenuated confusion at issue in 
sponsorship and affiliation cases does not necessarily or even often harm 
consumers or the market for quality products[,]”281 and the costs of protect-
ing consumers from this form of confusion is unreasonably high.282 “In de-
lineating the boundary between fair and unfair competition, we must keep 
firmly in mind that if competition is to remain an effective force for pro-
moting social welfare, we must leave room for would-be competitors to 
operate.”283 
C.  Resellers as a Class of Plaintiffs 
Suppose Karen  Dudnikov contacted other eBay resellers  who had 
faced similar problems, and they banded together as a class of plaintiffs to 
enjoin MLB and other repeat accusers from shutting them down. As dis-
cussed supra, resellers individually may not suffer enough damage to bring 
a  viable  lawsuit  themselves.284  Forming  a  class  of  plaintiffs,  however, 
would be more economical and encourage settlement as well.285 “Class re-
lief is ‘peculiarly appropriate’ when the ‘issues involved are common to the 
class as a whole’ and when they ‘turn on questions of law applicable in the 
same manner to each member of the class.’”286 Yet class actions are a rarity 
in the world of trademark law due to significant procedural difficulties.287 
For the resellers to sue a mark owner as a class of plaintiffs, they 
would need to show, under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(a), that (1) 
the class of resellers who are harmed by the mark owner’s actions is so nu-
merous that joinder of all members is impracticable; (2) there are questions 
of law or fact common to the class of resellers; (3) the claims of the repre-
sentative parties are typical of the claims of the class, and (4) the repre-

sentative  parties  will  fairly  and  adequately  protect  the  interests  of  the 
class.288 
The first two requirements of Rule 23(a), numerosity and commonali-
ty, “form the core of the class-action concept.”289 There would seem to be 
little difficulty in meeting the numerosity requirement. The site eBay alone 
boasts over 94 million users.290 If only 1 in 10,000 users had an auction 
closed or account unjustly terminated, that calculates to over 9,000 potential 
class members. And that considers only eBay users; it does not include re-
sellers who have their own websites or use other online auction sites. Hav-
ing as few as 40 class members should raise a presumption that joinder is 
impracticable and the numerosity requirement has been met.291 In addition, 
Internet resellers are spread across the globe, which tends to make joinder 
impracticable.292 
Regarding commonality, whether the trademark owner made a good-
faith inquiry into infringement before sending a takedown notification to 
eBay is one question of law and fact common to the class.293 Commonality 
requires that the class members “have suffered the same injury.”294 Recent-
ly, an eBay user brought such a claim against Coach, Inc.295 Gina Kim was 
a former employee of Coach who tried selling a genuine Coach handbag on

of:  
     (A) inconsistent or varying adjudications . . . or  
(B) adjudications . . . that, as a practical matter, would be dispositive of the interests of      
the other members not parties to the individual adjudications or would substantially im-
pair or impeded their ability to protect their interests; 
(2) the party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds that apply generally to 
the class, so that final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief is appropriate re-
specting the class as a whole; or  
(3) the court finds that the questions of law or fact common to class members predominate 
over any questions affecting only individual members, and that a class action is superior to 
other available methods for fairly and efficiently adjudicating the controversy.

eBay.296 Coach notified eBay, claiming the handbag was counterfeit, and 
eBay closed Ms. Kim’s auction and terminated her seller account.297 Ms. 
Kim sued for a declaratory judgment, among other claims, and attempted to 
certify a class of all consumers in Washington State who had received simi-
lar treatment from Coach.298 Ms. Kim alleged that Coach had no basis in 
fact for its allegation she was selling a counterfeit handbag.299 This appears 
to be a sufficiently common question.300 Even though generally trademark 
law may be rife with factual disputes, if the legal issue can be framed 
properly in terms of the trademark owner’s lack of inquiry and the reseller’s 
defense under first sale, then the matter is ripe for adjudication as a class 
action—because the “determination of its truth or falsity will resolve an 
issue  that  is  central  to  the  validity  of  each  one  of  the  claims  in  one 
stroke.”301  
In 2008, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, in 
Vulcan Golf, LLC v. Google Inc.,302 found the commonality requirement 
was met based on the allegation that the defendants had allegedly engaged 
in a deceptive scheme to benefit from the plaintiffs’ trademarks.303 Thus, the 
common question can center on the defendants’ actions.304  
A class action similar to Ms. Kim’s has been proposed in the U.S. Dis-
trict Court for the District of Colorado. In Righthaven LLC v. Buzzfeed, 
Inc.,305 the defendant, Buzzfeed, was sued for copyright infringement for 
posting a copyrighted photograph to its website.306 Buzzfeed filed a coun-
terclaim alleging that Righthaven’s lawsuits were an abuse of process be-
cause Righthaven did not own the copyrights at issue.307 Buzzfeed further

investigating whether Buzzfeed’s use of the photograph at issue was pro-
tected  by  fair use.308  Similarly,  our  hypothetical  class  could allege  the 
trademark owners are not investigating whether the resellers’ sales are pro-
tected by first sale and not infringing.309  
The likelihood of successful class actions will also depend on the legal 
claims pursued and the remedies available to the resellers.310 Defamation 
and tortious interference are among the claims that resellers have alleged.311 
The Righthaven lawsuit and proposed class is premised on the purported 
copyright owner’s failure to investigate fair use.312 Because the Copyright 
Act provides for attorney’s fees to the prevailing party,313 this bad-faith, or 
failure-to-investigate claim has much greater prospects under copyright law 
than it would under trademark law. The Lanham Act, on the other hand, is 
more grudging and convoluted in its fee-shifting; the prevailing party may 
only recover attorney’s fees “in exceptional cases.”314 As one judge ob-
served, “[a] rainbow of standards has been promulgated to define the word 
exceptional in the Lanham Act, some seemingly requiring bad faith or other 
culpability, others following a less stringent approach.”315  
At the close of 2010, Judge Richard Posner surveyed the standards 
used across the circuit courts and decided to use a bifurcated approach to 
awarding attorneys’ fees: if the losing party is the plaintiff, then “excep-
tional” means abuse of process; if the losing party is the defendant, it means 
the defendant “had no defense yet persisted in the trademark infringement 
or false advertising for which he was being sued, in order to impose costs 
on his opponent.”316 Therefore, at least in the Seventh Circuit, reseller-
defendants accused of trademark infringement would need to both prevail 
and prove that the plaintiffs engaged in abuse of process, i.e., “the use of

“[w]illfulness short of bad faith.”318 These standards may be difficult to 
meet, yet trademark owners are acting in bad faith by accusing Internet 
resellers of infringement, not because they are infringing, but because they 
are competing for sales.319 
FINAL THOUGHTS 
Protecting the resale market increases consumer choice and spurs mark 
owners to innovate and bring new and improved products to the market.320 
If we allow mark owners to prevent the resale of their goods, consumers 
lose out on the competition that resellers provide.321 Legislatively created 
first sale and nominative fair use doctrines, along with the elimination of 
initial interest confusion as a cause of action under the Lanham Act, would 
provide resellers and auction websites guidance in navigating the minefield 
of rights and duties with regard to Internet secondary-market sales, so that 
they more closely resemble the brick-and-mortar setting.322 This would sup-
port the economic policy goals underlying intellectual property323 and spur

“[w]illfulness short of bad faith or fraud will suffice” in exceptional cases). Ordinarily district courts 
have discretionary authority to award attorneys’ fees when a party has “acted in bad faith, vexatiously, 
wantonly, or for oppressive reasons.” Chambers v. NASCO, Inc., 501 U.S. 32, 45-46 (1991). That 
authority has been held not to apply to Lanham Act claims, however. Nightingale Home Healthcare, 
626 F.3d at 964-65 (citing Fleischmann Distilling Corp. v. Maier Brewing Co., 386 U.S. 714 (1967)). In 
addition to the fee-shifting provided in the Lanham Act, sanctions are available. “Any attorney . . . who 
so multiplies the proceedings in any case unreasonably and vexatiously may be required by the court to 
satisfy personally the excess costs, expenses, and attorneys’ fees reasonably incurred because of such 
conduct.” 28 U.S.C. § 1927 (2006); accord Waymark Corp. v. Porta Sys. Corp., 334 F.3d 1358, 1365

competition and innovation in the marketplace.324 These solutions would 
also benefit consumers looking for bargains and align trademark exhaustion 
in cyberspace with its application with brick-and-mortar settings.325 
Copyright326 and patent327 laws have robust first sale defenses, which 
severely limit ongoing rights of the copyright and patent owner beyond the 
first authorized sale of the material object which embodies the intellectual 
property right(s) at issue.328 However, the weakening of trademark first sale 
doctrine with regards to online sales and advertising has, to some extent, led 
to an “end run” around copyright first sale.329  
This dilution has increasingly allowed trademark, patent, and copy-
right owners to extend control over the resale of their goods, even though 
this restraint has consistently been rejected.330 In its construction and inter-
pretation of the Lanham Act, the Supreme Court has “been ‘careful to cau-
tion against misuse or over-extension’ of trademark and related protections 
into areas traditionally occupied by patent or copyright.”331 
After all, “[t]he rights of a patentee or copyright holder are part of a 
‘carefully crafted bargain,’ under which, once the patent or copyright mo-
nopoly has expired, the public may use the invention or work at will and 
without attribution.”332 And both courts and Congress are loath to extend 
through trademark that which has been lost through the expiration of a pa-
tent or copyright.333 
For the first sale/exhaustion doctrine to be meaningful in copyright 
and patent law contexts, it must be equally robust as a trademark infringe-
   
of the same economic traditions as incentive theory, but its focus is on the ability of intellectual property 
ownership to force the efficient use of inventions and creations through licensing.”).
