If we do, we cannot continue to ignore the root causes of migration in our
world. No matter how many physical barriers are constructed, if the
reasons why people flee their lands are not ameliorated, they will find a
way to defeat all barriers.

Of the global annual flow of around 15 million migrants, most fit into one
of four categories: economic (6 million), student (4 million), family (2
million), and refugee/asylum (3 million). There are about 20 million
officially recognized refugees worldwide, with 86% of them hosted by
neighboring countries, up from 70% 10 years ago
Some key factors that need to be addressed include:
·      People will do whatever it takes to survive and just like drugs, they
will keep coming regardless of military and physical barriers.
·      Fear sells and having people fear each other is a good way to get
their attention and support. The result is the rise of populist demagogues.
·      The money spent on border security could be much better spent on
alleviating the reasons why people are migrating. However, special
interests such as for-profit prisons and defense industries want you to
think their way works better.
·      The war on drugs has not worked and creates and environment of
lawlessness and corruption.
·      Poverty and economic migration are a major result of international
trade policies.
·      Political instability and wars are exploited and exacerbated by special
interests.
·      Not addressing these issues comprehensively will result in more
suffering, deaths, corruption, poverty and violence in a never-ending
vicious cycle.
This new age of barriers is not just about razor wire, reinforced concrete
walls, chain links and guards, planes, helicopters, drones, dogs and guns.
It also reflects the effects of war, poverty and lack of economic
opportunities and has led to the rise of populist politicians. The
 
https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/do-we-really-want-fix-immigration-ulysses-jaen/ 2/1511/13/2018 DO WE REALLY WANT TO FIX IMMIGRATION? | LinkedIn
effectiveness of their fear-mongering and nationalist rhetoric
demonstrates deeply ingrained rejection of cultural, religious and racial
assimilation, or integration.
These reactions suggest that globalization has marched forward on trade,
mobility and investment, but has failed miserably to take into account
subversive resentment developing among those who feel threatened; those
who are not thriving, and those who are directly impacted by the
aftermath of international trade’s only focus on profit for the traders while
ignoring the people who are left behind.
DHS Secretary Johnson, who is charged with finding solutions to these
issues explains it clearly in his latest report, “Border security alone cannot
overcome the powerful push factors of poverty and violence that exist in
Central America. Walls alone cannot prevent illegal
migration. Ultimately, the solution is long-term investment in Central
America to address the underlying push factors in the region. We continue
to work closely with our federal partners and the governments in the
region, and are pleased with the $750 million Congress approved in FY
2016 for support and aid to Central America. We urge Congress to
provide additional resources in FY 2017.”[1]
How do we find solutions? Take international trade for instance, Trade
agreements such as the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)
and the Central American Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA) excluded most
issues related to labor mobility. NAFTA has generated significant benefits
for US, Canadian and Mexican businesses at the same time that it reduced
the value of the Mexican currency by over 20% and increased the cost of
basic staples such as tortillas by more than 500%.[2] A 2014 PIIE study
of NAFTA's effects found that about 15,000 jobs on net are lost each year
due to the pact—but that for each of those jobs lost, the U.S.
economy gains roughly $450,000 in the form of higher productivity and
lower consumer prices. The benefits mean very little to the displaced
workers who need alternatives for improvement to be included in those
gains.

Economic development and immigration go hand in hand. “The US has
rarely thought about how its policies to encourage economic development
in poorer countries might affect immigration; similarly, it has rarely
thought about how its immigration policies might affect development...
This contrasts with Europe, where full membership in the European
Union—which includes the right for citizens of one EU country to work
in any other—has been conditional on reaching certain economic
benchmarks.”[3]The European model was never designed to deal with the
mass influx of refugees from the Middle East and northern Africa giving
rise to the Brexit movement and anti-immigrant sentiment.
There are over 250 million international migrants around the globe, of
whom 21.3 million plus are classified as refugees. South-South migration
is larger than in South-North migration. Intra-regional migration is large
in Europe and Central Asia, the Middle East and North Africa, and Sub-
Saharan Africa. Many of the World Bank’s client countries—for example,
India and South Africa—are large destination countries for migrants.
Income gaps and inequality, demographic imbalances, and environmental
changes suggest that migration pressures will continue for the foreseeable
future. In 2015, the ratio between the average income of the high-income
countries and that of the low-income countries stood at 70:1. It will take
decades before these gaps are closed.[4]
As a small businessman, I have tried my best to compete with producing
and marketing agricultural products, finished goods and value-added
services in Latin America, only to find that the corporate farming
competitors and current socio-economic realities are simply
overwhelming. Access to the markets, financing, distribution is not viable
for small entrepreneurs. Proponents routinely point out how countries
with greater financial inclusion are wealthier and less unequal. The World
Bank’s 2014 Global Financial Development Report, for instance, heavily
discusses these correlations. However, it costs me more to plant the seeds
that it costs for the finished product to be on the shelves of the ubiquitous
Walmart and affiliates. When I tried to diversify into aquaculture, the cost
of raising fish was much higher than what China can put the fish on the
table, and already cooked. As I turned for help from officials and
 
https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/do-we-really-want-fix-immigration-ulysses-jaen/ 4/1511/13/2018 DO WE REALLY WANT TO FIX IMMIGRATION? | LinkedIn
agencies, I found that they are in direct competition personally and/or that
they give major economic incentives and tools to the larger players at the
expense of my small business’ stability.
The book Portfolios of the Poor, explains that financial services are key to
managing volatile and irregular incomes. However, loans at unfavorable
rates are not a solution if the funds don’t enable me to compete. “Not
having enough money is bad enough. Not being able to manage whatever
money you have is worse. This is the hidden bind of poverty.”[5] The
small, productive farm is nearly extinct and the farmers and their workers
must find somewhere else to live or resign themselves to substandard
living conditions where they are. To get financing, the farm is put up for
collateral, the crops yield but the market is flooded with competing
product, the loan demand high interest servicing and goes unpaid and the
farm is ultimately lost .
Governments and international organizations such as the World Bank and
the International Monetary Fund can reduce the economic reasons for
immigration and enhance the positive results of global trade. We know
that remittance by migrants to their countries of origin reduce poverty and
the need for others to join them. Some politicians wrongly suggest that
increasing the cost of monetary transactions will reduce incentives for
migration and provide funds for building more barriers. This line of
reasoning is flawed as it will only create another source for criminal
enterprise to rise that would fill the need for monetary transactions to
occur. One much better way of providing additional funds would be to
reduce remittance and recruitment costs and mobilize philanthropic
contributions from the diaspora (World Bank 2015). Diaspora savings
(estimated to be $500 billion) could be mobilized via issuance of diaspora
bonds. Such financing would have greater impact if it were used to
finance programs the diaspora favors (infrastructure, schools, hospitals).
World Bank Group involvement in such projects could help reduce the
lack of trust that many Diasporas have in the governments back home.
The International Finance Corporation (IFC) could help scale up the
impact of migration on development by facilitating the engagement of the
 
https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/do-we-really-want-fix-immigration-ulysses-jaen/ 5/1511/13/2018 DO WE REALLY WANT TO FIX IMMIGRATION? | LinkedIn
private sector, in particular by mitigating commercial risks (including by
supporting micro-, small, and medium-size enterprise lending facilities
for immigrants in the host country); providing vocational and training
skills and supporting entrepreneurship (through venture capital funds,
start-ups, incubators, and accelerators in both host and home countries);
and leveraging its convening power to explore public-private partnerships
that provide services to and fund projects that benefit migrants. 
Financing tools are crucial for economic development, the reduction of
poverty and migration. When asked to explain why microfinance
institutions were shifting towards local sources of funding, experts cited
“increased availability” and “better pricing” as the two main reasons. [6]
These trends need to be reversed in order to scale microfinancing
globally. In an innovative pilot, the IFC provided a loan backed by future
remittances to Fedecredito in El Salvador. Since the mid-1990s,
commercial banks in Brazil, Mexico, and Turkey have raised billions of
dollars by issuing international bonds backed by future remittances and
payment rights. A proper accounting of remittances could also enhance
sovereign credit ratings and reduce borrowing costs.[7]
WEAPONS AND VIOLENCE INCREASE IMMIGRATION:
Other major problems such as the exportation of weapons into Mexico
and Latin America from the U.S. that has been reported at over 2000
illegal weapons a day play a major role.[8] According to data from the
Department of Justice’s Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and
Explosives (ATF), 73,684 firearms (about 70 percent) seized in Mexico
and traced from 2009 to 2014 originated in the United States.[9] The
proliferation of weapons has turned Latin America into gruesome crime
scenes as the drug cartels overrun society in their efforts to satisfy the
World’s demand for cheap drugs leaving a trail of violence, corruption,
desolation, and chaos. “In Mexico the war on drugs turned out to be a
worse evil than the one it set out to fight.” [10] Guatemala, Honduras and
El Salvador suffer from the highest homicide rates in the world. “What is
causing the violence? The nature of the violence is distinct in each
country, but there are common threads: the proliferation of gangs, the
 
https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/do-we-really-want-fix-immigration-ulysses-jaen/ 6/1511/13/2018 DO WE REALLY WANT TO FIX IMMIGRATION? | LinkedIn
region’s use as a transshipment point for U.S.-bound narcotics, and high
rates of impunity are major factors contributing to insecurity in the
region.”[11]
Heroin production has also increased to record levels. [12] Cocaine
production has also risen and has been driven by the same country,
Colombia despite billions of dollars in military aid to eradicate drugs in
that country. “Since the beginning of Plan Colombia, the US has given
Colombia over $5 billion with the vast majority going to Colombia's
military and police.”[13] According to the White House Office of
National Drug Control Policy, coca cultivation increased by 39.1 percent
in 2014, then a further 42.5 percent in 2015. Nationwide, coca
cultivations increased by 42.5 percent -- or 47,532 hectares -- in 2015,
reaching a total of 159,377. Compared to previous White House figures,
this outstrips the 39.1 percent increase seen between 2013 and
2014. According to the White House data, the total cocaine production
potential of Colombia in 2015 was 420 metric tons, up from 250 the
previous year.[14]
The statistics demonstrate that the production and consumption of drugs
keeps growing. However, the countries affected by the drug trade are
unable to control it and their people are being forced to migrate. The
biggest winners in the climate of violence and political instability include
the global aerospace and defense industries. According to a new report by
the accounting firm Deloitte, “the resurgence of global security threats”
promises a lucrative “rebound” in defense spending.[15]
The Deloitte report alerts investors that “revenue growth” is “expected to
take a positive turn” due to the terrorism and war in the Middle East and
the tensions in Eastern Europe and the South China Sea.

While the current border problems in the American Continent have
serious ramifications that strengthen criminal and corporate enterprises,
the same is true in other parts of the world. In Europe, specific companies
are also benefiting from the border wars.
 
The report , Border Wars: The Arms Dealers Profiting from
Europe's Refugee Tragedy, released jointly by the European Stop
Wapenhandel and Transnational Institute (TNI), outlines arms traders'
pursuit of profit in the 21st century's endless conflicts. "The human rights
of refugees play no real role in this thinking, except for promotional
purposes." according to Mark Akkerman, Stop Wapenhandel.
"There is one group of interests that have only benefited from the refugee
crisis, and in particular from the European Union's investment in
'securing' its borders,'" the report finds. "They are the military and
security companies that provide the equipment to border guards, the
surveillance technology to monitor frontiers, and the IT infrastructure to
track population movements." Indeed, "from 2005 to 2014, EU member
states granted arms exports license to the Middle East and North Africa
worth over 82 billion euros," according to the report.
The so called, Americans for Peace, Prosperity, and Security organization
is a new group whose main mission is to encourage continued global
militarism.[16] The APPS was formed by current and former officials
from Raytheon, BAE Systems, SAIC, and other major defense
contractors. Lobbyists who represent the defense industry are also
involved. Rogers, the former House Intelligence Committee chairman
who retired from Congress last year, also represents private clients,
though he has refused to disclose them.
Their mission is clear to anyone who cares to be informed. To “help elect
a president who supports American engagement and a strong foreign
 
https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/do-we-really-want-fix-immigration-ulysses-jaen/ 8/1511/13/2018 DO WE REALLY WANT TO FIX IMMIGRATION? | LinkedIn
policy,” the group spends money on public events in primary states and
encourages presidential candidates to take hawkish positions. The results
are favorable for the lobbyists’ clients, and most major candidates in 2016
are embracing extremely hawkish policies to confront political issues. If
recent statistics are anything to go by, future developments in
the worldwide trend of military expenditure are not expected to make
hopeful reading for those who advocate global disarmament.[17]
 
In the absence of newly declared war, how would the military-industrial
complex prosper without terrorism? (Image: KAZ Vorpal) The National
Priorities Project recently sent out an email with the subject line,
"Terrorism means business, if you're a defense contractor." The message
bluntly states:
If you're a defense contractor, terrorism means business, and business is
good. According to recent reports, the corporate defense behemoth
Lockheed Martin's revenue rose 15.7% and shares rose 1.5% following
the news that President Obama was committing an additional 250 troops
in Syria. 
Lockheed Martin was the biggest federal contract in 2014, pulling in
more than $32 billion in federal contracts, including $25 billion in
Pentagon contracts. Its federal haul makes it practically an honorary state.
In fact, the Project states that the contracts received by Lockheed Martin
in 2014 exceed federal grants allotted to each individual state, with the
exceptions of the high-population states of California, New York and
Texas.
DO BORDER WALLS REALLY WORK?
 
https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/do-we-really-want-fix-immigration-ulysses-jaen/ 9/1511/13/2018 DO WE REALLY WANT TO FIX IMMIGRATION? | LinkedIn
Pundits point to the Great Wall of China as a model to follow. “The
reality is that various Chinese kingdoms built multiple walls—many of
which have been lost to history—over a 1,500-year period to prevent
Mongol raids. The evidence of the oldest walls, said to have been built in
220 BCE, is thin: a single vague mention of fortifications in a historical
text written more than 100 years after the fact. If a wall was built 2,000
years ago, no evidence of it remains today. In the ensuing centuries other
walls were built out of tamped earth, but these were often seen as failures
and left to erode.”[18]
This phenomenon was demonstrated in the 1990s on the U.S.-Mexico
border when the first sections of fencing were built in El Paso and near
San Diego, supported by large deployments of Border Patrol agents. In
the weeks that followed, crossings in those sectors dropped to almost
zero. Similarly, the construction of Hungary’s border fence in 2015 was
backed up with border guards, and consequently, crossings dropped
substantially. However, in both cases fortified walls did not prevent
crossings into the United States and European Union entirely, but instead
shifted flows to other locations that were more remote or less fortified.
In the U.S. case, as high-traffic urban routes were closed, migrants and
smugglers began to cross in the remote and dangerous deserts of western
Arizona. Tunnels are built, new devices and methods are invented. Child
migration from Central America to the United States, which surged in
2014, has also been undeterred by enforcement (in fact most
unaccompanied minors turn themselves in to border agents), as tens of
thousands of children from El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala
spontaneously arrive at the U.S. border with Mexico to claim asylum.
Efforts to dissuade would be migrants are not working. The Central
American Minors (CAM) Refugee/Parole Program provides certain
qualified children in El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras a safe, legal,
and orderly alternative to the dangerous journey that some children are
currently undertaking to the United States.[19] The reduction in entries of
unaccompanied children is likely the result of Mexican repression against
immigrants in their southern border. But advocates charge that the policy
has not worked. The number of unaccompanied children who crossed the
 
https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/do-we-really-want-fix-immigration-ulysses-jaen/ 10/1511/13/2018 DO WE REALLY WANT TO FIX IMMIGRATION? | LinkedIn
Mexican border illegally in 2014 was 68,000; the figure fell to 40,000 in
2015 but has swelled again to 54,000 this year, according to government
statistics. "The reasons for that are quite simple: The root causes of
migration have continued unabated — violence in the region, narco-
trafficking," Wendy Young, president of Kids in Need of Defense, said
Tuesday during a conference in New York sponsored by the Center for
Migration Studies.[20]
In the European migration crisis in 2016, once land routes through the
Balkans were closed, migrants adjusted by shifting their routes to board
boats across the Mediterranean, frequently from Libya. The results are
tragic death tolls climbing before our very eyes. At the U.S.-Mexico
border this was evident in the decline in deaths in California which
coincided with a rapid rise in Arizona. The Tucson, Arizona coroner’s
office saw a substantial increase in the number of migrant deaths in the
years after the hardening of the border, as migration routes shifted to the
more dangerous deserts. “The Tucson morgue recorded an average of 18
migration-related deaths per year in the 1990's, while in the 2000's it saw
almost 200 per year. In 2010 the Border Patrol found more than 250
bodies in the Tucson sector, despite a decline in the total number of
border apprehensions. Similarly, when the European Union and Member
States fortified borders in 2015, there were a record 3,771 reported deaths
at the edges of the European Union. In 2016, with the easier land route
through the Balkans and Eastern Europe closed, the rate of deaths has
increased further, with more than 3,000 deaths recorded through July—a
50 percent increase from the previous year. By comparison, there were
just a handful of deaths recorded annually at the edges of Europe in the
1990's, and never more than 800 deaths prior to 2006.” [21]
NOT ADDRESSING THE REASONS FOR IMMIGRATION IS
COUNTERPRODUCTIVE.
When we recognize that barrier walls are not the solution, we can take
steps to alleviate the push/pull root causes of immigration. The first step
is to address the pull factors by providing work permits to the workers
needed by the US and European economies. Changing our priorities to
 
https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/do-we-really-want-fix-immigration-ulysses-jaen/ 11/1511/13/2018 DO WE REALLY WANT TO FIX IMMIGRATION? | LinkedIn
address economic needs and expediting authorization to contribute to the
migrants that our country’s economy needs will change the system.
Instead of suggesting that our children take over those jobs that we don’t
want to do ourselves, let’s educate our children to compete in a global
economy with the right education and skills.
Attack the major push factors: poverty and violence. Let’s invest in
developing our continent’s economies with fair trade agreements, access
to financing and training, and favorable policies that support democratic
leaderships.
Let’s take a closer look at the war on drugs by legalizing some use while
taxing and controlling them like we do alcohol, tobacco and
pharmaceuticals. Stop wasting money and resources to imprison non-
violent people caught up in this underworld. Let’s stop the arms and drugs
smuggling trades and drain their cartels’ bank accounts.
Let’s reduce income inequalities that force rural communities to migrate
to cities and from undeveloped nations to developed economies by
investing in the people, not their governments. Lending or giving money
to a government so that they can help their cronies or buy more weapons
is counterproductive. Let’s help the would-be migrants before they decide
to leave home. Let’s also help those we want to come, to do it legally, and
according to our country’s needs. It is long overdue, what we need is
humane, comprehensive, immigration reform.
