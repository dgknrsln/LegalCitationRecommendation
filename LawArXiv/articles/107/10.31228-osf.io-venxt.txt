FACES AND FINGERS: AUTHENTICATION

Abstract 
 
One of the most shocking outcomes of the pre-digital 
law  versus  post-digital  world  is  the  currently 
unconfirmed holding that although law enforcement 
may not compel the production of a password to unlock 
a mobile device, a finger, and likely a face, is fair game.  
You may be forced to “look” at your iPhone or “press” 
your finger against its fingerprint reader, but recitation 
of your password is off the table.  Both logically and 
legally this result is quizzical.  Merging these divergent 
outcomes, which both end in the same result—access—
is the aim of this Essay, using as fodder a technical 
understanding of “authentication,” the organic statute 
behind device unlock.  Because the sine qua non of 
authentication  is  identification  and  verification, 
unlocking a device necessarily imparts a truth telling: 
an expression of exclusivity, ownership, and control.  
These qualities are inherently testimonial; therefore, 
compelled  device  unlock  based  on  a  fingerprint  or 
facial scan should be deemed to infringe upon the Fifth 
Amendment’s protection against self-incrimination.

I.  Introduction 
 
Imagine you have the desire to protect digital information 
stored on a mobile device.  Would you feel comfortable using a mobile 
device with an unlock feature automatically triggered by an infrared 
scan of your face?  Stated concretely, if you own an iPhone with 
FaceID, should you anticipate being compelled to look at your phone, 
thus permitting access to those unsavory Google search queries1 or 
poorly thought-through selfies?2  Indeed, the only mechanism standing 
between the law and your secrets is your phone’s “lock” screen—
instantly, automatically, and, once set up, unstoppably “unlocked” 
with a simple glance.  
At face value, the answer to this question turns on the Fifth 
Amendment’s ability to protect physical features.  Historically, this 
has played out through a game of analogy: is the compulsion more like 
surrendering a physical key or a mental key?3  If the key involves no 
state-of-mind component (i.e., a physical feature), then the compulsion 
is likely non-testimonial and does not violate the Fifth Amendment.4  
However, if the key does involve some quantum of mental state, then 
the  compulsion  is  likely  testimonial,  protected  by  the  Fifth 
Amendment.5

2020]                                      FACES AND FINGERS: AUTHENTICATION                                63 
 
 
In  this  vein,  courts  consider  passwords  to  be  testimonial, 
meaning it is unlawful to compel the production of a special phrase, 
but  fingerprints  non-testimonial,  making  it  lawful  to  compel  the 
placement of a finger on a mobile device.6 Although this conclusion is 
not consistent across the board, a trend is identifiable.7  And in terms 
of a face, which easily places itself in the physical camp, the game of 
analogy would likely return a non-testimonial, just-tell-me-where-to-
look answer.8 
                                                 
6 See Commonwealth v. Baust, No. CR14-1439, 2014 WL 10355635, at *4 (Va. Cir. 
Ct. Oct. 28, 2014) (“In this case, the Defendant cannot be compelled to produce his 
passcode to access his smartphone but he can be compelled to produce his fingerprint 
to do the same.”). 
7 See e.g., In re Single-Family Home & Attached Garage, No. 17M85, 2017 WL 
4563870, at *2 (N.D. Ill. Feb. 21, 2017). 
The government does not seek authority to force the individuals to 
enter passcodes into the devices if necessary to unlock them, 
apparently  recognizing  that  this  would  violate  the  Fifth 
Amendment. It is only if the Apple device has been configured in 
advance  to  unlock  in  response  to  the  individual’s  unique 
fingerprint (the biometric passcode), that the government asserts 
the Fifth Amendment does not apply. In its view, law enforcement 
would  be  compelling  a  mere  physical  act  rather  than  a 
communicative act.  
Id.  Nevertheless, this court disagreed with the government, concluding that both acts 
are implicit testimony, which result in the individual unlocking the device.  Id.

Missing from the debate, however, is a technical understanding 
of the “why” behind device unlock.  What are the properties driving 
the  mechanics  of  device  unlock,  and  why  are  those  properties 
necessary for the mechanism to be considered “good enough” for 
public use?  The simple answer here is authentication—the means of 
identifying and verifying users.9  
Following a brief legal overview of compelled device unlock, 
this short Essay unpacks the technical underpinnings of authentication 
in the context of FaceID.  FaceID is Apple’s newest unlock mechanism 
which, in simple terms, uses a face as a key.10  This understanding is 
then  applied  to  the  constitutional  inquiry,  concluding  that  the 
primitives of authentication necessarily impart a substance in and of 
itself.  Authentication, in this sense, is a form of truth telling—an 
expression of exclusivity, ownership, and control.  Compelling the use 
of a finger or face to unlock a phone should not be deemed different 
than compelling the recitation of a password.  Whether finger, face, or

Incrimination,  33  CARDOZO  ARTS  &  ENT.  L.J.  211,  226–27,  234–35  (2015) 
(imploring that fingerprints when used to unlock a phone should be considered 
testimonial because it is taking on the job of a traditional numeric or alphabetic 
password). 
9 The term “authentication” takes on a different definition in the computer science 
literature as opposed to the legal literature, which often uses the term authentication 
when considering evidence.  Compare Authentication, TECHTERMS (July 13, 2018), 
archived at https://perma.cc/WZ7W-4WWQ (defining authentication in computer 
science literature as “the process of verifying the identity of a person or device”), 
with Authentication Law and Legal Definition, USLEGAL (Jan. 11, 2020), archived 
at https://perma.cc/U96T-65XW (defining authentication in legal literature as a 
“testimony by a proper party that a document is what it is purported to be and that 
the party attesting to it is qualified to do so”).  Authentication here may be thought 
of as “you are who you say you are.”  See infra Part III Section B. 
10 See Face ID Security, APPLE (Nov. 2017), archived at https://perma.cc/B5XW-
JVK2 (describing how iPhone FaceID works). 
With a simple glance, Face ID securely unlocks iPhone X. It 
provides  intuitive  and  secure  authentication  enabled  by  the 
TrueDepth camera system, which uses advanced technologies to 
accurately map the geometry of your face. Face ID confirms 
attention by detecting the direction of your gaze, then uses neural 
networks for matching and anti-spoofing so you can unlock your 
phone with a glance. Face ID automatically adapts to changes in 
your appearance, and carefully safeguards the privacy and security 
of your biometric data.

phrase, all are a form of truth telling, and thus should be deemed 
protected under the Fifth Amendment. 
 
II.  Testimonial Communication: Truth Telling 
 
  “No person . . . shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a 
witness  against  himself.”11   Although  three  independent  inquiries 
spring  from  this  one  constitutional  sentence,12 the  jurisprudential 
fireworks  have  mostly  been  reserved  for  the  last,  a  testimonial 
communication.  Further, the Supreme Court has graced us with a fair 
share of its own communication in discussing the acts that constitute 
the meaning of “testimonial.” 
  In one of the first cases to draw a hard line, Holt v. United 
States,13 the Court found the act of putting on a blouse to see if it would 
fit the defendant to be non-testimonial.14  The Court disagreed with 
defendant’s  argument  that  the  action  was  unconstitutionally 
compelled, or, as the defendant argued, an “extravagant extension of 
the Fifth Amendment.”15  In support of its decision, the Court stated 
that  prohibiting  compulsion  to  extract  communications  from  a 
defendant is distinct from the use of a defendant’s body as evidence.16  
If the use of a defendant’s body as evidence was prohibited, then it

12 An (1) incriminating (2) compulsion of (3) testimonial communication.  See 
United States v. Doe, 670 F.3d 1335, 1341 (11th Cir. 2012); see also Doe v. United 
States, 487 U.S. 201, 212 (1988) (discussing how the historical underlying policies 
regarding the self-incrimination privilege were to prevent a suspect from being 
compelled into producing information that would incriminate them).

A question arose as to whether a blouse belonged to the prisoner. 
A witness testified that the prisoner put it on and it fitted him. It is 
objected that he did this under the same duress that made his 
statements inadmissible, and that it should be excluded for the 
same reasons. But the prohibition of compelling a man in a 
criminal court to be witness against himself is a prohibition of the 
use of physical or moral compulsion to extort communications 
from him, not an exclusion of his body as evidence when it may 
be material. The objection in principle would forbid a jury to look 
at a prisoner and compare his features with a photograph in proof.

would in essence “forbid a jury to look at a prisoner and compare his 
features  with  a  photograph.”17   From  there,  the  rest  was  easy: 
providing a blood sample,18 voice or hand-writing exemplar,19 or 
required  presence  in  a  police  line-up 20  were  all  deemed  non-
testimonial.  
  The identifiable theme, beyond physicality, was that neutral 
actions  (i.e.,  those  having  no  bent  toward  substance  in  and  of 
themselves) are not protected by the Fifth Amendment.  As stated in 
Hubbell v. United States,21 although the contents of a document may 
be privileged, the “‘act of production’ may implicitly communicate 
statements of fact.”22  This is to say, physical features merely exist, 
and requiring them to be plainly displayed—regardless of the feature’s 
identifying23 characteristics—does not  give rise to constitutionally 
protected substance or facts. 
  More recently, however, less-clear cases have attempted to blur 
this line.  One of the most interesting, In re Grand Jury Subpoena to 
Sebastian Boucher, decided in 2007 (“Boucher I”) and revised in 2009 
(“Boucher II”),24 involved access to a computer containing illegal 
content.  Although the computer had been consensually accessed by a 
security guard unveiling illicit material, on later inspection, encrypted 
files put a hard-stop to the investigation.25  Law enforcement could not 
practically  or  theoretically26 view  these  files  without  a  passcode,

19 See Gilbert v. California, 388 U.S. 263, 266–67 (1967).  
20 See United States v. Wade, 388 U.S. 218, 222–23 (1967). 
21 167 F.3d 552 (D.C. Cir. 1999), aff’d, 530 U.S. 27 (2000). 
22 See United States v. Hubbell, 530 U.S. 27, 37 (2000) (stating that the “act of 
production” is the act of producing documents in response to a subpoena).  
23 See United States v. Hubbell, 167 F.3d 552, 574–75 (D.C. Cir. 1999), aff’d, 530 
U.S.  27  (2000)  (citing  Schmerber  v.  California,  384  U.S.  757,  764  (1966)).  
Identification in this sense is not the same as using the evidence for a truthtelling 
effect. While a person’s hand or a person’s finger communicates—this is my hand or 
my finger—the individual proffering the hand is merely being “compelled to make 
himself available as a source of ‘real or physical evidence.’”  Id.  “For purposes of 
Fifth Amendment analysis, it is dispositive that the government has no need to rely 
upon the witness’s truthtelling to secure the evidence it seeks.”  Id.

which the defendant did not want to divulge.27  Although the district 
court seemed to find favor with the defendant’s Fifth Amendment 
argument, it eventually pivoted, finding that although the files were 
protected by the Fifth Amendment, the computer had already been 
inspected, and therefore the “foregone conclusion” applied.28 
  The foregone conclusion has its roots in Fisher v. United 
States,29 where an accountant attempted to have documents withheld 
that were already known in existence and location to the government.30  
The  Court  ruled  in  favor  with  the  government,  finding  that  the 
documents were not being compelled for “truth telling” purposes.  
Rather, the government already “knew” of the documents’ existence 
and merely needed the metaphorical lock to be released.31  Likewise,

Amendment: Exploring the Technical Boundaries, 32 HARV. J. L. & TECH. 169, 176–

An encryption algorithm is a procedure that, given a piece of 
information  (sometimes  called  a  ‘plaintext’)  and  a  password 
(sometimes called a ‘secret key’), produces an encryption [i.e. an 
encrypted  version  of  the  plaintext]  (sometimes  called  a 
‘ciphertext’). A decryption algorithm is a procedure that, given an 
encryption  and  a  password,  produces  the  original  piece  of 
information (i.e. the plaintext).  
Id.  The quoted material refers to symmetric encryption, where a “secret key” is used 
for both encrypting a piece of plaintext and decrypting a piece of ciphertext.  Id.  
Other forms of encryption exist (e.g., asymmetric encryption), which use two 
different secret keys for encryption and decryption.  Id.; see also Panayotis Vryonis,

Sounds,  MEDIUM  (Aug.  27,  2013),  archived  at  https://perma.cc/RBU7-FJMX

28 See Boucher I, 2007 WL 4246473, at *8–9 (comparing entering a password into a 
computer with merely asking a person to enter the password into the computer).  
Unfortunately, this leads to the “forbidden trilemma; incriminate [oneself], lie under 
oath, or find [oneself] in contempt of court.”  But see Orin S. Kerr, Compelled 
Decryption and the Privilege Against Self-Incrimination, 97 TEXAS L. REV. 767 
(2019)  (discussing  the  foregone  conclusion  doctrine,  which  “limits  the  Fifth 
Amendment protection to cases in which the government is trying to use the target’s 
testimony to convict him”).  Further, divulging a password implicitly communicates 
ownership and control—a truth telling warranting protection.  See Boucher II, 2009

the government in Boucher II had enough knowledge of the illegal 
material’s existence (i.e., these files had already been seen) to bypass 
the Fifth Amendment’s privilege and compel production of the court-
deemed mental state (i.e., the password). 
  Exemplifying  the  above  concerns  culminates  in  Justice 
Stevens’s dissent in Doe v. United States.32  Here, the majority found 
that compelling a defendant to sign a consent decree releasing banking 
records was not testimonial because it was not an implicit or explicit 
factual assertion disclosing incriminating information.33  It is notable 
that the Court focused heavily on the language of the consenting 
instrument.  “[T]he form does not acknowledge that an account [exists] 
or that it is controlled by petitioner. Nor does the form indicate whether 
documents or any other information relating to petitioner are present 
at the foreign bank . . . . The form does not even identify the relevant 
bank.”34  Again, this comes from the through-line in Fisher—truth 
telling.    The  majority  argued  that  the  release  form  permitting 
disclosure was not used for its “truth telling” effect.  In other words, 
the form was viewed as more of a logistical lock to the substance rather 
than the substance in and of itself.  But it is on this point—a point 
further exemplified by the properties of authentication35—that Justice 
Stevens disagreed.  
  Justice Stevens noted how the defendant’s forced signature on 
the release was necessarily tied to a statement of fact.  “The [consent 
decree] itself may not betray any knowledge petitioner may have about 
the circumstances of the offenses being investigated by the grand jury, 
but it nevertheless purports to evidence a reasoned decision by Doe to 
authorize  action  by  others.”36   Although  implied  ownership  is  a 
somewhat tenuous form of authorization, and not enough for the 
majority  to  disallow  the  compulsion,  it  is  enough—according  to

33 See id. at 208–10.

35 Id. at 216. 
Nor would his execution of the form admit the authenticity of any 
records produced by the bank. Not only does the directive express 
no view on the issue, but because petitioner did not prepare the 
document, any statement by Doe to the effect that it is authentic 
would not establish that the records are genuine. Authentication 
evidence would have to be provided by bank officials.

Justice Stevens—to warrant a pause.  This gave rise to Justice Stevens 
noting how a defendant may be “forced to  surrender  a key to  a 
strongbox  containing  incriminating  documents,  but  [may  not  be] 
compelled to reveal the combination to his wall safe—by word or 
deed.”37  
  Indeed,  Justice  Stevens’s  statement  has  become  the 
cornerstone of a growing body of case law viewing the testimonial–
non-testimonial  distinction  as  hinging  on  a  physical–mental 
distinction.38  We can see this in United States v. Kirschner,39 where a 
defendant was permitted to withhold his computer password from the 
government because it imbued his state of mind.40  Further, this is also 
seen in Commonwealth v. Baust,41 where the court found a passcode 
protected by the law (i.e., a content of the mind), but a fingerprint 
unprotected by the law (i.e. a mere physical attribute).42  The trend 
continued in State v. Diamond,43 where the court held that compelling 
a defendant to use a finger to unlock a phone “is no more testimonial 
than  furnishing  a  blood  sample,  providing  handwriting  or  voice 
exemplars, standing in a lineup, or wearing particular clothing.”44  
  Additionally,  the  physical–non-physical  distinction  is 
currently the favored approach by law enforcement.  For example, in 
a district court in California, pursuant to a warrant, a defendant was 
required to “place his face in front of an iPhone X” that was found in 
his  possession during the course of  an execution of a  warrant.45  
Similarly, a memorandum with a genesis of the Central District of 
California argued that using a fingerprint to unlock a device is simply 
and solely a physical endeavor—something entirely beyond the fingers 
of the Fifth Amendment.46

  Rejecting this trend, however, and understanding the nuance of 
Justice Steven’s statement, is In re Single-Family Home & Attached 
Garage.47   In  this  case,  the  court  looked  beyond  the  superficial 
physical–non-physical inquiry and asked “whether, under the specific 
facts and circumstances presented, the act [being compelled] implicitly 
conveys incriminating information unknown to the government.”48  
Here,  the  government  “request[ed]  that  the  court  authorize  law 
enforcement to press the fingers [of several subjects found] at the 
Subject Premises to the Touch ID sensor of any Apple brand device[s] 
found at the Subject Premises.”49  Curtly, law enforcement wanted to 
conduct a brute-force, guess-and-check method to see which suspects 
matched which phones, and then search the contents of those phones 
once unlocked.  
  Viewing an “unlock” as more of a symbolic act, as found in the 
Fisher case’s dicta, the court was able to see this for what it really is: 
an  expression  of  ownership—a  statement  of  substance  in  and  of 
itself.50  The court noted how, in today’s age, a simple fingerprint can 
reproduce the entire contents of a device.51  At minimum, a fingerprint 
expresses  current  possession  and  control  over  a  device.52   True 
enough, the holding here is limited by this court’s statement on the 
trial-and-error method to be used by the government.53  Nonetheless, 
In re Single-Family Home & Attached Garage marks an important 
pushback against a growing trend to demarcate constitutionality based 
on physical or mental compulsion.

2020]                                      FACES AND FINGERS: AUTHENTICATION                                71 
 
 
III.  Keys and Locks 
 
Surprisingly, the Fifth Amendment debate we find ourselves in 
is driven by technologies that themselves have received scant attention 
in the conversation.  Yet, passwords, pins, fingers, and faces have all 
been  subject  to  incredible  amounts  of  research  in  the  technical 
literature.54  More importantly, the overarching principle behind all of 
these technologies—authentication—is given the left-swipe by many 
courts.  Bridging  that  gap,  and  in  turn  offering  a  more  nuanced 
understanding of the issues, this Essay uses FaceID as a vehicle for 
digging into the ins and outs of locks—specifically, biometric locks.
   
A.  Biometrics 
 
  The public’s familiarity with biometrics is not owed to a new 
invention,  but  an  old  technology  that  has  recently  been  given  a 
facelift.55  The facelift comes from a culmination of two specific 
advances: (1) neural networks and (2) sensors.56  In turn, the ability to 
“recognize” faces was first introduced at technical conferences, which 
approached human-level quality and allowed for mass public use.  
  Using a neural network for facial recognition goes something 
like this: the neural network takes as input the image of a face and 
produces as output a prediction of whose face it is. 57  Under the covers,

this involves: (1) creating a mathematical representation of the image; 
(2) running this representation through a series of pre-set filters,58 
which highlight features in the image like edges or straight lines (i.e., 
feature hunting); and (3) using the result of step two’s feature hunting 
to drop the images into labeled buckets.59  If the bucket is the same one 
that the user created when setting up FaceID, then the phone will 
unlock. 
  The above summary is what researchers from Facebook and 
Tel Aviv University demonstrated in 2014, vastly improving the state-
of-the-art technology for facial image recognition at the time.60  In fact, 
shortly after their paper came out, Google released their own research 
relying  on  a  similar  technique  which  demonstrated  even  better 
results.61  However, the problem with both approaches, in terms of 
public release at the time, was with in-the-wild recognitions, which 
suffered from factors like pose, illumination, expressions, and facial 
changes.62  When these factors are present, something else is needed 
to meet human-level quality classification. 
  To overcome the difficulties of changing faces and lighting, 
researchers introduced a series of sensors to give neural networks an 
additional dimension of feature information.63  In part, this is why

iPhones  using  FaceID  use  infrared  dot  projections.64   However, 
truthfully, the dot projections serve a much more important purpose 
that hints at the core of how the technology is designed—security.  
  Around the same time as the ground-breaking research on 
facial recognition was coming to fruition, researchers at University of 
North Carolina at Chapel Hill65 demonstrated a method of “spoofing” 
all existing facial recognition systems by using a 3D virtual reality 
model based on simple Facebook images.66  The spoofing, allowing 
unauthorized  individuals  to  unlock  systems  relying  on  facial 
recognition  technology,  was  incredibly  successful  because  facial 
recognition at the time was solely camera based.67  In fact, even 
simpler  spoofing  worked  in  2009  by  merely  showing  a  facial 
recognition system a still picture of a face.68  In response, “liveness” 
checks were added to most systems, requiring movements like eye 
blinking or eyebrow raising during use.69  The spoofing research in 
2016  blew  past  all  liveness  checks  because  of  its  virtual  reality 
component, using a face that moves and interacts with the world in a 
realistic but simulated way.70  Therefore, to ensure virtual-reality

users and gain access”).  
67 See Yi Xu et al., supra note 65, at 509 (explaining how the researchers outlined 
three options for overcoming the spoofing: light projection, pulse detection, and 
infrared illumination).  Apple, at least in part, uses the first option because a pattern 
of illumination can be detected by the phone; the phone need only send out a pattern 
of light emissions and check for the corollary response.  Id.; see also Bud, supra note

people, these systems of the time—in reality—were  more focused on  merely 
checking if a face were present in the captured image.  Id.

spoofs  failed,  something  else  besides  liveness  was  needed.    The 
solution, at least for Apple, was the introduction of controlled and 
measured illumination (i.e., the dot projections), which detect when a 
device or model was being used instead of a face.71 
Stepping  back  however,  consider  why  researchers  were 
concerned about spoofing in the first place.  What good is a key if the 
lock does not prevent others from entry?  In other words, what are the 
goals of the lock—why should it be designed one way over another? 
 
B.   Authentication 
 
The answer to these questions is authentication, a concept with 
roots in cryptography.72  Authentication supplies the purpose behind 
the key-to-lock mechanism.  In this way, it is like the organic statute 
giving  rise  to  systems  like  FaceID  and  TouchID.    And  here  is 
authentication’s statutory text—the lock should be designed to provide 
both identification (i.e., the presentation of something unique) and 
verification (i.e., corroboration of the unique identifier).73  These two 
elements together are found in a Request for Comments’s74 definition 
of the “authentication process:” 
 
Identification  step:  Presenting  the  claimed  attribute 
value  (e.g.,  a  user  identifier)  to  the  authentication 
subsystem.  
 
Verification  step:  Presenting  or  generating 
authentication information (e.g., a value signed with a 
                                                 
71 See Face ID Security, supra note 10, at 3 (“To counter both digital and physical 
spoofs, the TrueDepth camera randomizes the sequence of 2D images and depth map 
captures, and projects a device-specific random pattern.”). 
72 Cryptography’s  own  organic  statute  calls  for  confidentiality,  integrity,  and 
authentication.  See generally JONATHAN KATZ & YEHUDA LINDELL, INTRODUCTION 
TO MODERN CRYPTOGRAPHY 3–23 (CRC Press, 2d ed. 2015).  
73 See STALLINGS & BROWN, supra note 54, at 72.  
74 The Request for Comments (RFC) is a collection of documents, mostly managed 
by the Internet Engineering Task Force, regarding the protocols and technical 
underpinnings of the Internet. For instance, there is an RFC on Hypertext Transfer 
Protocol (“HTTP”), Internet Protocol (“IP”), and Transmission Control Protocol 
(“TCP”).  See RFC 2616, archived at https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616 (for HTTP); 
RFC 791, archived at https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc791 (for IP); RFC 793, archived 
at https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc793 (for TCP). These documents provide specific 
detail on the standards behind the tools of the Internet.

private key) that acts as evidence to prove the binding 
between the attribute and that for which it is claimed.75 
 
To  understand  each  of  these  roles,  consider  the  process  of 
authentication (i.e., logging in) on an operating system.  When a user 
goes to log in to a computer, the computer accepts as input a keyboard-
typed password, checks this input with the previously stored password 
you typed when you first set up the computer, and returns a true or 
false depending on whether there is a match.76  Access is granted on 
true and denied on false.77  
Similarly, FaceID takes as input the scan of a face, the scan is 
then compared to a scan from when the user initially setup the phone, 
and the system returns a true or false depending on a match.  The two 
steps work together: (1) identification through the presentation of 
something unique like a face; and (2) verification through the means 
of a matching process. 
 
1.   Identification: You Are Who You Say You Are 
 
  Identification is traditionally acquired in one of three ways:78 
(1) something the user knows, like a password; (2) something the user 
possesses, like a token; or (3) something the user is, like a finger or 
face.79  The reason these identifiers work is because of exclusivity: a 
                                                 
75 RFC 4949 (2007), archived at https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4949 (providing a 
glossary of terminology for information system security). 
76 See Authentication, supra note 9 (“Entering the correct login information lets the 
website know (1) who you are and (2) that it is actually you accessing the website.”) 
77 See  id.  (explaining  that  it  is  important  to  use  “uncommon,  hard-to-guess 
passwords” because if someone knows your email address they may be able to guess 
your password and gain access). 
78 As is often the case in computer science, these techniques may be combined to 
offer a best of both worlds approach.  See, e.g., Andrew Teoh Beng Jin, David Ngo 
Chek  Ling  &  Alwyn Goh,  Biohashing: Two Factor Authentication Featuring 
Fingerprint Data and Tokenized Random Number, 37 PATTERN RECOGNITION 2245, 
2245 (2004).  
79 See STALLINGS & BROWN supra note 54, at 72.  
There are four general means of authenticating a user’s identity, 
which  can  be  used  alone  or  in  combination:  Something  the 
individual  knows:  Examples  includes  a  password,  a  personal 
identification number (PIN), or answers to a prearranged set of 
questions. Something the individual possesses: Examples include 
   ______________________________________________________________________________
______________________________________________________________________________ 
 
 
76                                          JOURNAL OF HIGH TECHNOLOGY LAW                [Vol. XX: No. 1 
 
 
password you alone know, a token you alone have access to, and a 
physical feature you alone possess.  Importantly, uniqueness is not the 
end goal here, exclusivity is—something “you alone know.”80  True 
enough, uniqueness is often gained with exclusivity, but this is not the 
gravitas of identification.  
  For example, no matter how unique a text-based password is, 
consider how simple it would be to guess and check every possible 
combination of characters in a three character password, otherwise 
known  as  a  “brute-force”  attack. 81    Thus,  the  first  method  of 
identification—something the user knows—could  leave password-
protected content subject to access by someone without authorization.  
Now consider the second method—something the user possesses, such 
as the key to a house.  Anyone in possession of the right key can gain 
access to the house that the key unlocks.  But how do we know that the 
person in possession is necessarily the person with authorization to 
access the house?  It doesn’t matter how unique the key is—it matters 
that the key is in the exclusive possession of the authorized person.  
Confidence in knowing that the only person in the house is the person 
authorized to be there is the sine qua non of identification. 
  Despite the fact that uniqueness is subordinate to exclusivity, 
creating a password from personal knowledge may nonetheless be 
appropriate because passwords provide a theoretically large guessing 
space (typically more than three characters), making it difficult to 
brute-force the password.82  The same is true for something  you 
                                                 
electronic keycards, smart cards, and physical keys. This type of 
authenticator is referred to as a token. Something the individual is 
(static biometrics): Examples include recognition by fingerprint, 
retina,  and  face.  Something  the  individual  does  (dynamic 
biometrics):  Examples  include  recognition  by  voice  pattern, 
handwriting characteristics, and typing rhythm.  
Id.  Although the authors present four versions of identification, the fourth is not as 
common.  Id. 
80 This ties into the Fifth Amendment because while exclusivity implies ownership 
(a substantive, “factual” quality), uniqueness does not.  
81 See sources cited supra note 26 and accompanying text (discussing the difficulty 
of guessing an alphanumeric password); see also What’s a Brute Force Attack?, 
KASPERSKY (Jan. 9, 2020), archived at https://perma.cc/Q5B4-3C9Y (defining a 
brute-force attack as a process of deciphering a password through trial and error).  
82 This is why common passwords like “12345” completely defeat authentication’s 
purpose.    See  The  Importance  of  Strong,  Secure  Passwords,  SECURE  DATA 
RECOVERY (Jan. 11, 2020), archived at https://perma.cc/DU5L-34YN (setting forth

possess, like a key, which can prevent unauthorized access so long as 
exclusive possession is maintained.  Along the same lines, the third 
method of identification is also effective.  Something the user is, such 
as a face, contains enough unique detail to acquire confidence that no 
one else has the same facial features, and thus access is exclusively 
available to the user.83   
 
2.  Verification: Means of Corroboration 
 
  The second part of the two-step process involves the means by 
which an identity is assessed.  In its simplest form, verification merely 
requires the computer check whether two “strings” are the same.  
Pseudocode here is helpful to fully understand what is occurring under 
the hood:84  
 
1.  previously_stored_password = “12345” 
2.  instant_password = input(“Type your password: ”) 
3.   
4.  if instant_password == previously_created_password: 
5.      return True 
6.  else: 
7.     return False 
 
This simple process is the core of verification—using value equality 
“==” to see if the newly entered password (i.e. the “instant_password”) 
is the same as the previously stored password. 
                                                 
how passwords are similar to a lock-and-key system).  If a person has the right key, 
then they are able to gain access.  Id. 
83 See Gaile G. Gordon, Face Recognition Based on Depth and Curvature Features, 
IEEE 2 (1992) (discussing the various attributes faces impart—e.g., “nose bridge, 
nose base, nose ridge, eye corner cavities, convex center of the eye, eye socket 
boundary, boundary surrounding the nose”). 
84 This code, based in the coding language of Python, is provided to show how simple 
it is to accomplish the second part of the two-step process.  See Derrick Kearney, 
First  Steps  with  Python,  REAL  PYTHON  (Jan.  11,  2020),  archived  at 
https://perma.cc/C2BB-N58R.  On line #1 we store the original, previously-created 
password captured between parenthesis as a “string” of characters. On line #2 we 
have the computer ask the user for a new, instantly-entered password.  Id.  The two 
passwords are compared for equality on line #3, and either a successful result (line 
#5) or an unsuccessful result (line #7) is returned.  Id.

The process is more complicated for biometrics, which is why 
the use of neural networks is needed.85  But if we remove a layer of 
abstraction, it is easy to see why neural networks are helpful—they 
provide feature hunting.86  To be able to recognize a face, you need to 
be able to tell one face apart from another.  Although most faces look 
similar (i.e. two eyes, one nose and a mouth), there is a need to be able 
to  distinguish  faces  in  order  to  recognize  them.    Teasing  out 
uniqueness, the core of the “means” of authentication, is exactly what 
neural networks are best for.  Thus, this is why a neural network is 
required for facial recognition, and the same reason why Apple needed 
to include an extra “neural engine” processing chip (i.e. a neural 
network workhorse) on phones with FaceID.  
  In sum, for both passwords and faces, the end-result of the 
verification step is the same.  A previously stored value is compared 
to a new value, resulting in either true (i.e. access granted) or false (i.e. 
access denied).  Here, biometric authentication systems are provided 
with the requisite amount of uniqueness and are merely tasked with 
checking that uniqueness against previously stored uniqueness. 
  Putting  it  all  together,  facial  scans,  fingerprint  scans,  and 
passwords are all used for the purpose of establishing authentication.87  
The primitives of this concept—identification and verification—are 
the bedrock on which these devices run, making them a key component 
in any dispute on whether a fingerprint tap, or face scan is permissibly 
compelled.

2020]                                      FACES AND FINGERS: AUTHENTICATION                                79 
 
 
IV.   Authentication == Truth Telling 
 
If unlocking a device with either a face or fingerprint scan did 
not impart any quantum of truth telling, then its compulsion would not 
offend the Fifth Amendment.  An inference may be drawn from the 
decision in Hubbell that if the “unlock” were a neutral action having 
no implication of truth telling in and of itself, then its compulsion 
would be appropriate.88  Yet, this is precisely what authentication does; 
compelling an individual to “place his face in front of an iPhone X” 
communicates a statement of fact.89 
 
A.  Exclusivity Imparts a Factual Statement 
 
The mechanisms of “unlock” were not created in a vacuum.  
Just  the  opposite,  the  purpose  behind  these  mechanisms—
authentication—is a design goal that spans from decades of work.  If a 
lock on a door did not provide security that only authorized individuals 
could enter, then the purpose of the lock would be lost.  Likewise, if 
FaceID were to be easily tricked and unlocked with someone else’s 
face, then it would be considered a failed technology.  
Passwords are effective as “something you know” because at a 
high level they are simply something others do not know.  Similarly, 
faces are only useful as “something you are” because no one else 
possesses those unique characteristics in identical form.  FaceID as a 
feature would be considered a failure if it did not impart exclusivity, 
ownership, and control—the very qualities separating this act from the 
physical-based Fifth Amendment cases. 
 
B.  Difference in Kind 
 
Moreover, being compelled to confirm “this is my fingerprint” 
is very different from confirming “this is my phone.”90  Consider that 
                                                 
88 See United States v. Hubbell, 530 U.S. 27, 34–35 (2000) (“The act of exhibiting 
such physical characteristics is not the same as a sworn communication by a witness 
that relates either express or implied assertions of fact or belief.”).  
89 If the foregone conclusion were to apply, however, the result would flip. 
90 See e.g., sources cited supra notes 21–23 and accompanying text.  The crux of the 
argument is that requiring a suspect to produce a set of “prints” for matching 
fingerprints left at the scene of the crime is the same “identification” inherent in 
matching a fingerprint to an iPhone.  See id.  This point entirely misses Riley’s

mobile  devices  with  cloud  storage  options  have  a  theoretically 
unlimited amount of storage potential.91  As Riley v. California92 
appropriately noted, the ability to carry essentially an entire house of 
personal information in your pocket is not something to be taken 
lightly.93  The contents of this treasure trove, all of which are implicitly 
tied to an individual via FaceID or TouchID, are merely a glance or 
touch away—compelled entry into a no holds barred fishing expedition. 
Further, if my fingerprint was found at the scene of the crime,94 
it  would  not  compare  to  the  compelled  presentation  of  all  the 
information  my  phone  holds  (i.e.  text  messages,  photographs, 
locations, etc.).95  Compelled unlock does not  merely evidence a 
“person”—it  is  a  binding  between  an  incredibly  detailed  digital 
summary and an incredibly unique individual. 
                                                 
watershed implication—the digital world is not only different in degree, it is different 
in kind.  See Riley v. California, 573 U.S. 373, 394 (2014). 
91 See Bruce Schneier, How the Supreme Court Could Keep Police From Using Your 
Cellphone to Spy on You, SCHNEIER ON SECURITY (Nov. 27, 2017), archived at 
https://perma.cc/KV8D-4J4A (claiming that the contents of your phone defining who 
you are is not an outlandish concept).  “The cellphones we carry with us constantly 
are the most perfect surveillance device ever invented.”  Id. 
92 573 U.S. 373 (2014). 
93 See id. at 394–97 (finding that police having the ability to conduct a warrantless 
search of a phone, would be like finding a key in the suspects pocket and then 
conducting a warrantless search of a house).  
94 Fingerprints are not gathered in mass to reveal the location of a person for the past 
year, nor does a fingerprint divulge the fact that someone was “sliding into your 
DMs” last night).  The digital world is different in kind, as Riley notes.  See id.; see 
also Amy Mackelden, A Comprehensive Guide to Sliding Into Someone’s DMs, 
COSMOPOLITAN (Dec. 28, 2018), archived at https://perma.cc/9X6Q-7Q4L (“Simply 
put, [sliding into a DM] refers to a direct message sent on social media, most often 
Instagram or Twitter, in which a random user or online acquaintance sends an 
unexpected private message.”). 
95 Consider the seemingly innocuous Wi-Fi toothbrush.   See Andrew Guthrie 
Ferguson, The “Smart” Fourth Amendment, 102 CORNELL L. REV. 547, 576–77 
(2017). 
Most mornings I wake up and brush my teeth with a smart 
toothbrush that has the Wi-Fi capability to be connected with a 
smartphone and beyond. Data about my teeth brushing habits is 
generated and sent to collecting sensors and receptors. The data 
reveals something personal about my hygiene habits, reveals a 
pattern of my waking time and sleeping time, and arises from 
inside my person (my mouth). The data also derives from my 
bathroom in my home.  
Id.  From one simple device, information on location, wake-time, and sleep-time may 
derive valuable evidence to corroborate or eviscerate an alibi.  Id.

V.  Conclusion 
 
The  binary  physical–mental  distinction  for  constitutionally 
compelling  someone  to  unlock  their  device  fails  under  user 
authentication.  Due to this, odd results like permissible compulsion 
for fingerprints, but not passwords, occurs.  Authentication imparts a 
truth telling—a difference in kind from obtaining a set of fingerprints 
or a DNA swab.  The truth telling implicit in both password recall and 
biometric authentication is the same,96 and thus the legal result should 
be as well. 
 
                                                 
96 Not to mention the perverse incentives of opting to use a potentially less safe 
method of authentication (i.e., a password) because it provides safer compulsion 
protection.  See David Sancho, Passwords: Not Going Away Anytime Soon, TREND 
MICRO (Apr. 30, 2014), archived at https://perma.cc/GU4J-93Y3.
