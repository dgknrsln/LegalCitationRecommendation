Regulating Loot Boxes as Gambling? Towards a Combined Legal and 
Self-Regulatory Consumer Protection Approach 
 
Abstract 
Loot boxes represent a popular and prevalent contemporary monetisation 
innovation in video games that offers the purchasing player-consumer, who always 
pays a set amount of money for each attempt, the opportunity to obtain randomised 
virtual rewards of uncertain in-game and real-world value. Loot boxes have been 
and continue to be scrutinised by regulators and policymakers because their 
randomised nature is akin to gambling. The regulation of loot boxes is a current and 
challenging international public policy and consumer protection issue. This paper 
reviews the psychology literature on the potential harms of loot boxes and applies the 
behavioural economics literature in order to identify the potentially abusive nature 
and harmful effects of loot boxes, which justify their regulation. This paper calls on 
the industry to publish loot box spending data and cooperate with independent 
empirical research to avoid overregulation. By examining existing regulation, this 
paper identifies the flaws of the ‘regulate loot boxes as gambling’ approach and 
critiques the alternative consumer protection approach of adopting ethical game 
design, such as disclosing the probabilities of obtaining randomised rewards and 
setting maximum spending limits. This paper recommends a combined legal and 
self-regulatory approach: the law should set out minimal acceptable standards of 
consumer protection and industry self-regulation should thrive to achieve an even 
higher standard.

1. Introduction 
‘Loot boxes’ are consumable virtual items in video games that can be 
redeemed (or ‘opened’) by players to receive randomised rewards, which may be 
merely cosmetic, or which may influence the game more significantly by unlocking 
additional game content or manipulating the player’s in-game power. This paper 
adopts a wide interpretation of the meaning of ‘loot boxes’ to include other 
randomised monetisation methods in video games which may not necessarily be 
represented as a ‘box:’ for example, treasure chests; military supply crates; card 
packs; gacha prize dispensers; and prize wheels. In some games, these rewards may 
be transferable between players and accordingly gain real-world monetary value.1 
Randomised game mechanics in general are arguably inherent to game design and 
have been implemented in video games for decades.2 However, paid loot boxes 
specifically, i.e., loot boxes that require the payment of real-world money to obtain 
(rather than loot boxes that are obtained ‘for free’ by completing in-game tasks, such 
as defeating enemies3) is a relatively recent monetisation innovation that has been

established; therefore, this paper focuses on paid loot boxes.

the subject of public controversy4 and regulatory scrutiny5 due to its randomised 
nature and apparent similarity to gambling. 
 
1.1. History and commercial background 
The origin of the loot box mechanic can be traced back to the collectible and 
tradable sports cards of the mid-twentieth century.6 Loot boxes were inspired by the 
successful monetisation of Magic: The Gathering (1993, Wizards of the Coast), a 
tabletop trading card game,7 which, instead of selling a complete collection of every 
available card to its players, sells blind sealed packages of randomised cards of 
varying power and value that forces players to effectively purchase duplicate cards, 
and thereby spend more money than they otherwise would have to, in order to 
obtain a complete collection.8 Magic: The Gathering has relied upon and sustained 
itself on this same lucrative business model through to the present day. 
 
The initial digital implementations of loot boxes were in free-to-play games 
on mobile phones that relied solely on paid loot boxes to monetise, e.g., Puzzle & 
Dragons (2012, GungHo Online Entertainment). Such games adopt the ‘freemium’ 
business model: instead of directly selling all of their content outright, they offer a

portion of their content to players for free as an alternative business strategy in order 
to attract the largest possible userbase, and then monetised by convincing a portion 
of that userbase they have attracted to make optional ‘premium’ in-game purchases 
and unlock more content.9 However, loot boxes are now also commonly 
implemented in full-priced games on consoles and PCs, e.g., Overwatch (2015, 
Blizzard Entertainment).10 Such games originally monetised based solely on title 
sales, but now also implement loot boxes as an additional, supplementary 
monetisation method. 
 
The adoption of alternative monetisation methods, such as implementing loot 
boxes, is a highly successful attempt by the video game industry to respond to 
commercial pressures within the rapidly developing but hypercompetitive 
industry,11 such as meeting consumer pressures to keep title prices low despite 
increasing production costs; rampant piracy facilitated by illegal online file-sharing, 
including torrenting, that digital rights management (DRM) has failed to prevent 
technologically; and the pressing need for less-established game companies to 
explore alternative business models and user acquisition methods, such as 
freemium, in an over-saturated market.12 The prevalent implementation of loot boxes 
reflects a change in the business model of many video games to rely significantly on 
‘microtransactions:’ this transition can be conceptualised as ‘game as a service,’ 
which will be provided and paid for segmentally and periodically over a length of

time (e.g., subscription-based monthly ‘battle pass’ systems), as compared to the 
traditional ‘game as a product’ conceptualisation by which a game was provided 
and sold at once as a complete package. This change brings positive effects to 
consumers, such as increased accessibility to gaming products, and the freedom to 
choose to pay for video gaming services in manners more suitable to the consumer’s 
own financial situation and desired amount of dedication to a particular game.13 
Nonetheless, the widespread implementation of paid loot boxes in video games is 
concerning. 
 
1.2. Statistics: prevalence; engagement; total spending and individual spending 
Loot boxes are currently prevalent in video games; are purchased by a 
significant percentage of players; and are deemed suitable for purchase by children. 
Macey and Hamari concluded that loot boxes are presently ‘prevalent in all types 
and genres of contemporary video games’14 and that their purchase is widely 
popular with esports participants across all age groups (46.2% of those surveyed 
purchased loot boxes).15 Zendle et al.’s survey of the UK games market found that 
56% of top-grossing mobile games on Apple and Android, and 36% of top-grossing 
desktop games on Steam, contained loot boxes, and that 93% of Android games 
containing loot boxes were deemed suitable for children aged 12+ and 57% were also 
deemed suitable for children aged 7+.16 The UK Gambling Commission’s 2019

survey found that 28.1% of 11–16-year-olds in the UK have used in-game items and 
22.9% have paid money to open loot boxes.17 
 
Conclusive data on loot box spending (either total or per individual player) 
cannot be collated because such data is held by game companies and they do not 
release loot box sales data to the public. Juniper Research predicted that total 
spending on loot boxes and ‘skins gambling’ (i.e., gambling on, inter alia, eSports 
tournament results using in-game cosmetic items, including those obtained from 
loot boxes18) will rise from under US$30 billion (≈£22.9 billion) in 2018 to US$50 
billion (≈£38.2 billion) in 2022.19 Approximately 20% of all surveyed Heroes of the 
Storm (2015, Blizzard Entertainment) players were classified as problem gamblers on 
the Problem Gambling Severity Index (PGSI):20 such players were documented to 
have individually spent on average US$83.86 (≈£64) monthly on the loot boxes of 
just this one game.21 Players may well be invested in and playing multiple games 
simultaneously, and therefore spending money buying loot boxes in multiple games. 
Therefore, actual monthly individual spending on loot boxes may be many times 
more than Zendle’s findings. Indeed, mainstream media has reported extreme cases, 
demonstrating public attention to the issue: four children spent ‘nearly £550 in three

18 Skins gambling is another gambling-related video game issue that should be addressed either by 
law or self-regulation to ensure consumer protection, especially in relation to vulnerable groups, such 
as children. The psychology literature on loot boxes, and how loot boxes will be addressed by the 
industry and by regulators, may inform the regulation of skins gambling. However, skins gambling is 
not within the ambit of this paper.

weeks’ on loot boxes using their father’s bank account without permission and still 
failed to get the rare item they were after.22 Another player discovered that he has 
‘spent over US$10,000 [(≈£7642)] in just two years’ on the loot boxes of one single 
game by requesting his personal data from the game company using data protection 
legislation;23 this latter case also demonstrates that game companies have indeed 
collected and are in possession of data on individual players’ loot box spending. 
 
The statistics cited demonstrate that the video game industry has a significant 
financial interest in loot boxes and may be incentivised to ensure their continued un-
regulation, and that the regulation of loot boxes is a substantial issue that impacts 
many people across the world, including vulnerable groups, such as children. 
Accordingly, the regulation of loot boxes may be justifiable to prevent potential 
gambling-related harms and, regardless of any contravention of gambling laws, to 
ensure consumer protection in general. 
 
2. Potential harm: perspectives from psychology and behavioural economics 
Loot boxes are structurally similar to gambling because they possess elements 
in common with gambling and satisfy Griffiths’ definition of gambling in 
psychology.24 The purchase of loot boxes has been identified as an ‘emergent

gambling behaviour.’25 The randomised nature of loot boxes is arguably designed to 
encourage purchase in manners similar to gambling.26 Certain implementations of 
loot boxes may be ‘predatory’ because they ‘disguise or withhold the true long-term 
cost of the activity until players are already ﬁnancially and psychologically 
committed.’27 
 
2.1. Link between problem gambling and loot boxes 
Zendle and Cairns’ large-scale survey, based on the players’ self-reported 
quantitative measures of the intensity of their problem gambling on the Problem 
Gambling Severity Index (PGSI), demonstrated ‘an important relationship between 
problem gambling and the use of loot boxes,’28 which is that: ‘[t]he more severe that 
participants’ problem gambling was, the more money they spent on loot boxes.’29

relationship between problem gambling and loot boxes.30 Further research is 
required to conclusively identify the exact nature of the relationship between loot 
boxes and gambling; however, arguably, further independent research is currently 
being stifled by the video game industry’s general failure to be socially responsible 
by cooperating with academics by providing verifiable player spending data on loot 
boxes. 
 
2.2. Loot box prizes as rewards in a variable-ratio schedule of reinforcement 
Players’ problematic escalating desire to purchase and open loot boxes may 
be explained by applying the behavioural psychology concept of ‘reinforcement:’ 
Skinner demonstrated that a certain desired behaviour can be ‘reinforced’ in a 
subject through a gradual process of incrementally ‘rewarding’ behaviours which 
constitute correct steps towards the formation of that certain desired final 
behaviour.31 Rare and valuable prizes obtained from loot boxes have been likened in 
popular media to ‘rewards’ which are able to ‘positively reinforce’ the player 
behaviour of purchasing and opening more loot boxes through the release, in the

player’s brain, of dopamine,32 a neurotransmitter activated by rewards, and which 
causes ‘wanting’ and potentially ‘addiction.’33 
 
The randomised and unpredictable value of the rewards obtained from loot 
boxes qualifies their reward schedule as the variable-ratio schedule of 
reinforcement.34 This particular schedule of reinforcement rewards the subject 
unpredictably such that they are forced to exhibit the desired behaviour repeatedly, 
even when they are not guaranteed to obtain a reward for each instance of doing so, 
in the hope that any one such instance of the desired behaviour would finally elicit a 
reward.35 This schedule of reinforcement is widely known to and heavily abused by 
gambling operators.36 
 
The psychology literature appreciates that the positive reinforcement 
framework, particularly the variable-ratio schedule of reinforcement, is capable of 
causing the acquisition of extremely persistent behaviours, e.g., gambling and,

perhaps by extension, purchasing and opening loot boxes, and therefore can explain 
why loot boxes may constitute a predatory monetisation method.37 
 
2.3. Behavioural economics: loot boxes may abuse irrational biases 
In addition to loot boxes’ link with problem gambling and their potential 
abuse of the variable-ratio schedule of reinforcement, loot boxes may also be 
predatory because they present and abuse experimentally demonstrable decision-
making cognitive biases and fallacies of the player,38 and thereby cause players to 
make irrational, ‘maladaptive purchasing decisions.’39 It is arguable that, when 
influenced and misled by decision-making biases, the player’s ‘choice’ to purchase 
and open loot boxes is no longer free, voluntary and informed. This is synonymous 
with how gamblers are influenced by fallacies and decision-making heuristics,40 
which simplify judgement but may lead to ‘severe and systematic errors.’41 For 
example, ignoring any house rules, the popular game of 38-pocket American roulette 
has an expected value of − 5.26%, thus a bet of $1 is expected to, in the long-term, on 
average, lose $0.0526.42 Playing roulette in these circumstances is irrational. 
Nonetheless, gamblers continue willingly to make the decision of betting on roulette 
and participating in other gambling games, and losing their money because they are

than they otherwise would have. One such bias has been identified as ‘entrapment,’ 
whereby ‘a decision-maker continues to expend resources at least in part to justify 
previous, hitherto unfulfilled, expenditures.’44 For example, ‘when the gambler 
wishes to recoup losses he has already incurred and therefore decides to roll the dice 
“just one more time.”’45 Similarly, the loot box-purchasing player may wish to justify 
the losses they have incurred in their previous failed loot box openings (when they 
did not obtain the rewards they wanted) by buying even more loot boxes in the hope 
of finally obtaining their desired valuable rewards; therefore, entrapment may 
deceptively cause the player to make ‘maladaptive’ loot box purchasing decisions.46

Exploitative Monetized Services: An Examination of Game Patents from a Consumer Protection 
Perspective’ (2019) 101 Computers in Human Behavior 131, 140–141. 
    13  
Another such bias is the ‘gambler’s fallacy.’47 For example, ‘[a]fter observing a 
long run of red on the roulette wheel, most people erroneously believe that black is 
now due…’48 Such gamblers are failing to rationally recognise independent random 
events as independent,49 and are instead irrationally and erroneously interrelating 
them.50 The gambler’s fallacy could apply to the purchasing and opening of loot 
boxes because players may erroneously interrelate each independent loot box 
openings and believe that they would gain a better chance of ‘winning’ and opening 
valuable content after successively ‘losing’ and failing to obtain rare items. 
Accordingly, the gambler’s fallacy is capable of misleading the player into 
purchasing more loot boxes immediately after they had just failed to obtain rare 
items from a prior batch of loot box purchases, which would result in the player 
spending more money on loot boxes than they had previously intended to or 
budgeted for. It is particularly concerning that some games manipulate the 
probabilities of obtaining rarer rewards according to the player’s spending 
behaviour: ‘pity-timer’ mechanics increase the probabilities of acquiring rarer 
rewards, or guarantee their acquisition, after the player has failed to obtain the rarer 
rewards in prior attempts.51 These pity-timers arguably reinforce the gambler’s 
fallacy by literally making it true with regards to certain, but not all, loot boxes:

players may erroneously assume that all loot boxes have an in-built pity-timer 
mechanic. 
 
2.3.3. Near-miss effect 
The third irrational bias that loot boxes may abuse is the ‘near-miss effect.’52 A 
‘near-miss’ occurs when ‘an unsuccessful outcome is proximal to the designated 
win, such as when a chosen horse finishes in second place or when two cherries are 
displayed on the slot machine payline.’53 The near-miss effect refers to how the 
presentation of a losing situation as a near-miss encourages players to make further 
attempts.54 Clark et al. argued that ‘the recruitment of win-related regions [of the 
brain] during near-miss outcomes underlies their ability to promote gambling 
behavior.’55 Loot box openings are often presented with explosive visual animation 
and celebratory audio effects regardless of the value of the rewards obtained. 
Arguably, loot boxes are designed to build anticipation in the player similar to 
gambling,56 and to disappoint that player in order to expose them to a near-miss so 
as to encourage further purchases.

Reid suggested that people inexperienced with gambling may be more prone 
to the near-miss effect.57 This is particularly worrying and relevant to the potential 
regulation of loot boxes because many players engaging with loot boxes do not 
necessarily realise that they are gambling when they play video games. Indeed, 
sixteen regional gambling regulators58 have expressed their concerns with the risks 
posed by ‘the blurring of lines between gambling and … video gaming.’59 Loot boxes 
are randomised, not ‘innocent’ and may represent ‘games of chance,’ but they are 
presented (or, if viewed more sceptically, hidden) within video games which are 
generally perceived as ‘games of skill.’60 The conflation of the two activities is 
socially worrying and a ‘clear public concern’ because consumers may be unable to 
differentiate between the video game itself and (quasi-)gambling elements 
incorporated into it (e.g., loot boxes), such that, for example, children may end up 
gambling unknowingly with ‘money intended for computer game products’ given to 
them to spend by their similarly unknowing parents.61

Actual loot box purchasing data collected and possessed by game companies62 
is required to conduct comprehensive, empirical investigations on the relationship 
between loot boxes and gambling; to confirm if the additional introduction of any 
irrational biases outlined above induces maladaptive loot box purchases; and to 
assess the potential harms of loot boxes in general. However, currently, such crucial 
data has not been made available for independent research by game companies. 
Although this failure to release data can be appreciated from a commercial 
standpoint, this position does not treat consumers fairly, and is socially irresponsible 
and arguably unethical. Although such data may be commercially sensitive as they 
may reveal the amount of total sales and user numbers,63 game companies should 
proactively collaborate with researchers to find appropriate ways to desensitise and 
anonymise the data released.64 For example, the limited release of the anonymised 
spending data of 1000 random users would not reveal any business sensitive 
information but would still assist empirical research significantly. The release of 
such data may also give rise to data protection concerns; however, an update to the 
privacy policy should resolve any such issue. Most players would likely welcome 
such research. 
 
The applicability and effectiveness of industry data to research was 
demonstrated by Zendle who took advantage of the removal of paid loot boxes from 
 
62 As compared to experimental loot box purchasing data that may be collected by researchers using a 
specially designed which would not have been derived from a commercially viable video game, or 
potentially biased and inaccurate anecdotal data reported by players themselves. 
63 The Author is grateful to an anonymous peer-reviewer for identifying this issue. 
64 Whilst also ensuring that no conflicts of interests arise, e.g., when a certain company’s game is 
incidentally ‘promoted’ by empirical research for being less harmful, especially when other 
companies were not given the opportunity to be assessed in a comparable manner.

Heroes of the Storm in March 201965 and conducted a survey which demonstrated that 
‘When loot boxes were removed from Heroes of the Storm, problem gamblers spent 
significantly less money in-game.’66 However, Zendle’s conclusion was only 
tentative due to a lack of verifiable datasets: Zendle was only able to rely on 
unverifiable, self-reported data from players. Only with the release of industry data 
by game companies for further independent empirical research could the many 
questions surrounding the potential harms of loot boxes be fully assessed and 
answered.67 
 
Currently, there is an ‘information asymmetry’ between elements of the video 
game industry that implement paid loot boxes and the public: these companies are 
in possession of data (if not also the results) as to the potential harms of loot boxes, 
but the public and regulators are forced by these companies to have access to little, if 
any, information. This information asymmetry renders the current relationship 
between these companies and the public arguably inequitable, and renders the 
current relationship between these companies and regulators ‘evasive’ and 
disingenuous.68

It ought to be recognised that different video game companies hold divergent 
perspectives on the continued implementation of loot boxes. When giving evidence 
to the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee of the UK House of Commons 
(DCMS Committee), Kerry Hopkins, Vice President for Legal at Electronics Arts, 
refused to recognise paid loot boxes implemented in FIFA Ultimate Team as paid ‘loot 
boxes’ and categorised them as ‘quite ethical and quite fun.’69 In contrast, Epic 
Games has implemented ‘X-Ray Llamas’ which are paid loot boxes that reveal all of 
its rewards prior to purchase, thus allowing players to make an informed decision.70 
This effectively removed randomisation from the purchasing of loot boxes, but not 
from the mechanic itself,71 and rendered the product no longer a ‘loot box’ per se and 
more akin to purchasable additional game content, i.e., ‘DLCs.’ Other game 
companies never implemented loot boxes in their games and have no plans to do so 
in the future: Wan Hazmer of Metronomik, an indie developer, has recognised the 
ethical issues relating to the implementation of paid loot boxes and refused to 
implement them despite potential commercial loss.72 Given the current notoriety of 
and aversion to paid loot boxes amongst video game players, it is arguable whether 
or not the decision not to implement loot boxes by a particular game company could 
be seen as an ‘ethical’ decision that is capable of being appreciated by players and

may be promoted by the media,73 and would in turn drive up sales of the game and 
be a better commercial decision in the long-term than implementing paid loot boxes. 
 
Although the industry does not hold a uniform position on whether or not 
paid loot boxes are ethical,74 the industry’s failure to release data for independent 
research has been universal. For companies that are continuing to implement paid 
loot boxes in video games, their failure to cooperate with regulators and researchers 
by providing loot box spending data is irresponsible and arguably unethical, but 
may be excused for commercial reasons, given that the area remains unregulated in 
most countries. However, companies that have already stopped implementing paid 
loot boxes (perhaps in recognition of the ethical implications), but are still in 
possession of past loot box spending data, would not necessarily be negatively 
affected by the prospective regulation of loot boxes and may be in a position to 
release these data for independent research. In fact, the release of this data may 
benefit responsible companies immediately through positive publicity, and also 
long-term if prospective regulation of loot boxes would divert spending on loot 
boxes to other more ethical video gaming monetisation methods. However, no such 
release has been forthcoming. Socially responsible game companies that are in a 
position to gain (or at least in a position not to lose) from the release of loot box 
spending data should publish it and support independent research.75

74 And whether or not particular implementations of paid loot boxes are ethical, as pointed out by an 
anonymous peer-reviewer, e.g., in relation to ‘pay-to-win,’ whereby a player can only be competitive 
when compared to other players if they continually invest money into the game by purchasing newly 
released products.

2.5. Pre-emptive regulation justified by the precautionary principle? 
The DCMS Committee, in its recent inquiry report, argued that the 
‘precautionary principle’ (that ‘the lack of scientific certainty cannot justify 
[regulatory] inactivity in cases of high risk’76) should apply to justify the pre-emptive 
regulation of loot boxes, because game companies cannot prove that the 
monetisation schemes which they have designed and implemented, such as loot 
boxes, are not harmful.77 The Committee went above and beyond only calling for 
game companies to release industry data for research into the extent of the potential 
harm of loot boxes in order to better inform potential regulation: the Committee 
argued that it is no longer necessary for academics or regulators to prove that loot 
boxes represent a predatory monetisation method and are harmful in order to justify 
regulation, and that it is now instead the responsibility of the game companies 
implementing these monetisation methods to prove that loot boxes are not predatory 
and harmful in order to justify the continued lack of regulation. The DCMS 
Committee’s assertion is worrying in that negative proof of loot boxes not being 
harmful is impossible to obtain from a scientific perspective: it is literally asking the 
impossible from the industry.78 A more reasonable approach would be to ask for 
evidence that harm is unlikely or minimal.

The DCMS Committee recommended that UK gambling law should be 
amended in due course after consultation to regulate paid loot boxes,79 whilst, only a 
few months later, the Gambling Industry Committee of the UK House of Lords 
recommended the immediate regulation of paid loot boxes as gambling by executive 
regulations without waiting for further consultation.80 These recommendations 
teeter on the edge of overregulation and mirror the position taken by the Belgian 
gambling regulator (that all paid loot boxes constitute gambling regardless of 
whether or not their rewards are worth real-world money, and that consumers’ 
access to all loot boxes would be prohibited, unless they are appropriately licensed 
as regulated gambling), which has led to the complete removal of certain games 
from the Belgian market, e.g., Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp (2017, Nintendo & 
NDcube),81 and therefore deprived consumers of the opportunity to play certain 
games. An overly paternalistic outright ban of loot boxes also unduly restricts the 
industry’s creative output and economic potential82 (although forcing game 
companies to stop defaulting to monetising with loot boxes and instead invent and 
experiment with other more ethical monetisation methods may revitalise creativity). 
Both game companies and players lose out when loot boxes are overregulated. These 
comparatively drastic regulatory positions that have been recommended (a version 
of which has been adopted in Belgium) suggest that, if the video game industry 
continues to be uncooperative when working with independent researchers and

regulators, overregulation negatively affecting the industry creatively and 
commercially may be the inevitable result. The industry should be well-advised to 
act responsibly now to avoid this potential undesirable outcome. 
 
2.5.2. Certain implementations of loot boxes are defensible 
The most prominent problem with paid loot boxes is potential 
overspending.83 A loot box implementation released monthly whose rewards are all 
guaranteed to be obtained if the maximum capped spending of £30 is reached by the 
player is defensible. A paid loot box mechanic that can simultaneously be relatively 
easily accessed by performing non-paid in-game actions, such as logging-in to the 
game or defeating enemies, would also make the implementation more defensible. If 
the rewards of the loot box do not influence the player’s in-game powers (and 
perhaps only make cosmetic changes), and would not advantage the player when 
compared to other players or a hypothetical version of themself who did not 
purchase loot boxes, then this implementation is also defensible. These changes in 
loot box implementation which try to prevent overspending and avoid placing 
undue pressures on the consumer to spend money (such as when a loot box is made 
available for purchase only for a limited time) can be referred to as ‘ethical game 
design.’84 Therefore, in the Author’s opinion, the consumer protection issue relating 
to loot boxes needs not necessarily be solved by the outright ban of loot boxes, which 
may negatively affect game companies financially and deny players access to certain 
 
83 Notwithstanding the potential harms of non-paid loot boxes and other seemingly harmless 
gambling references ‘normalising’ gambling behaviours by making them appear to be regular social 
activities that ‘normal’ people engage with, as such potential harms remain to be empirically 
established, see Xiao, ‘Which Implementations of Loot Boxes Constitute Gambling?’ (n 1). 
84 For other ethical game design measures that game companies should consider implementing, see 
Daniel L King and Paul H Delfabbro, ‘Video Game Monetization (e.g., “Loot Boxes”): A Blueprint for 
Practical Social Responsibility Measures’ (2019) 17 International Journal of Mental Health and 
Addiction 166. See also Xiao and Henderson (n 51).

video game content, and which may not be the best solution to the problem for all 
parties involved. Accordingly, the prohibitive gambling law approach to regulating 
loot boxes should be critiqued. 
 
3. Regulating loot boxes as gambling? Limited success and many flaws 
The obvious regulatory response to loot boxes has been to examine whether 
or not they constitute ‘gambling’ under existing gambling regulation, and to classify 
and regulate them as such if they do. The benefit of directly adopting existing 
gambling law to potentially regulate loot boxes is that such laws are already 
legislated and in effect, and therefore can be immediately executively applied by 
relevant regulators, if appropriate. 
 
3.1. Divergent definitions of gambling 
To oversimplify the divergent gambling laws of various jurisdictions, 
‘gambling’ is generally conceived of in law as requiring three elements: ‘stake;’ 
‘chance;’ and ‘prize.’85 Certain implementations of loot boxes may plainly constitute 
gambling under existing laws by satisfying these elements. However, each 
jurisdiction defines each element differently, and may add or remove elements: for 
example, under UK law, the ‘prize’ must be worth real-world money for the element 
to be satisfied;86 in contrast, in Belgium, there is no ‘prize’ element per se, and Belgian

Gambling in Cyber Places: A Review of the Literature’ (Victorian Responsible Gambling Foundation

casino-gaming.pdf> accessed 14 April 2020. 
24     
gambling law instead examines whether or not there is a ‘chance of wins or losses.’87 
A prize which is not worth real-world money is nonetheless a ‘win’ under Belgian 
gambling law.88 
 
Different gambling laws mean that certain implementations of loot boxes may 
constitute gambling in one jurisdiction, but not in another.89 For example, the UK 
Gambling Commission opined that only loot boxes which are both paid for and 
which provide rewards worth real-world money constitute ‘gambling,’90 and that 
neither non-paid loot boxes (which may nonetheless provide rewards worth real-
world money), nor paid loot boxes that do not provide rewards worth real-world 
money constitute ‘gambling.’91 The Dutch92 and French93 gambling regulators came 
to similar conclusions. In contrast, the Belgian gambling regulator opined that paid 
loot boxes constitute gambling regardless of whether or not their rewards can be 
transferred between players and therefore possess real-world value.94

A divergence can be identified even between the Dutch, and the UK and 
French regulators: although they have taken similar regulatory positions on which 
implementations of loot boxes constitute gambling, they enforce their positions to 
different degrees. The Dutch regulator was much less sympathetic towards game 
companies, who ostensibly explicitly disallow the transfer and selling of in-game 
items between players (which would give them real-world value) but nonetheless 
implicitly facilitate such activities. The Dutch regulator opined that such 
implementations constitute gambling. The UK and French regulators gave game 
companies the benefit of the doubt and determined that such transfer facilities do 
not necessarily render a loot box ‘gambling’ if and when the game companies have 
attempted to restrict the players’ ability to transfer and sell in-game items: the UK 
regulator opined that the restriction has to be ‘successful,’95 but no prosecution or 
other enforcement action has been brought against evidently ‘unsuccessful’ 
implementations that can be and have been exploited;96 the French regulator decided 
that, at present, the potential monetisation of the prizes through third-party websites 
has not been explicitly authorised by the game operator, and, therefore, the prizes of 
such loot boxes do not possess monetary value.97 
 
3.3. Lack of universal, international consumer protection 
The potential harms of paid loot boxes do not appear to be related to whether 
or not their prizes are worth real-world money; paid loot boxes whose rewards are 
not transferable and are not worth real-world money appear to be just as potentially 
harmful.98 When a certain implementation of loot boxes constitutes gambling in a

certain jurisdiction, then it should be regulated as gambling in that jurisdiction. 
Unfortunately, not all implementations of paid loot boxes fall under the definitions 
of gambling in all jurisdictions. This meant that consumers are protected only if they 
happen to live in a country whose existing gambling law covers both paid loot box 
types. Indeed, currently, only Belgian consumers are fully protected, as all paid loot 
boxes have been removed; in the Netherlands, game companies complied by only 
removing paid loot box reward transfer features (thus ensuring that loot box 
rewards are not worth real-world money), without removing paid loot boxes 
themselves.99 Dutch consumers remain exposed to the potential harms of paid loot 
boxes whose rewards are not worth real-world money. The contrast in compliance 
by 2K Games in the Netherlands and Belgium is particularly telling.100 Consumer 
protection is not ensured universally as it should be. 
 
3.4. Departing from the ‘regulate loot boxes as gambling’ approach 
All paid loot boxes should be regulated regardless of whether or not their 
rewards are worth real-world money, but not necessarily as gambling per se. 
Multiple papers in the legal literature and gambling regulators have attempted to fit 
the regulation of loot boxes into the existing gambling law framework of various 
jurisdictions101 (e.g., arguing that certain implementations should constitute illegal 
lottery gambling under Californian law102). Such assessments often fail in relation to

paid loot boxes whose rewards are not worth real-world money because the ‘prize’ 
element cannot be satisfied. However, in the Author’s opinion, the inability of 
existing gambling law in many jurisdictions to include paid loot boxes whose 
rewards are not worth real-world money should be accepted. Hasty amendments to 
gambling law that extends existing definitions of gambling to cover such 
implementations of loot boxes, as for example recommended by the DCMS 
Committee in the UK,103 is not necessarily well-advised: expanding the legal concept 
of what may constitute ‘prizes,’ specifically the meaning of ‘money’s worth’ in the 
UK to include perceived non-monetary value, ostensibly only for the purpose of 
regulating loot boxes, may potentially unfairly render other harmless activities, and 
other activities which are unlikely to be harmful, ‘gambling’ in the eyes of the law 
and unduly restrict people’s ability to engage with them. Additionally, regulating 
loot boxes as gambling would face the same difficulties encountered by the 
regulation of online gambling in general, including complications with enforcement 
when consumers gamble with overseas service providers.104 
 
4. Consumer protection measures? 
The regulation of loot boxes should also be approached from a consumer 
protection perspective, in addition to applying existing gambling law.105 Ethical 
game design measures that seek to minimise harms include, amongst others: 
disclosing the probabilities of obtaining potential rewards; establishing maximum

spending limits; and disabling ‘cash out’ features.106 These three measures have been 
partially implemented in certain countries and as self-regulation by the industry in 
other jurisdictions. The practicality of regulating through and enforcing these 
measures are critiqued, and recommendations as to how to improve their 
implementation in the future are made. 
 
4.1. Disclosure of probabilities of obtaining potential rewards 
The People’s Republic of China (PRC) did not approach the regulation of loot 
boxes from a gambling perspective: instead, video gaming service providers in the 
PRC are required to disclose the probabilities of obtaining potential rewards.107 The 
video game industry has also generally been accepting of this measure as a self-
regulation solution in other jurisdictions.108 For example, the Entertainment Software 
Association (ESA) announced that the video game industry is ‘committing’ to 
‘further inform[ing] consumer purchases:’ the three leading hardware providers, 
Sony; Microsoft and Nintendo, ‘will require paid loot boxes in games developed for 
their platforms to disclose information on the relative rarity or probability of 
obtaining randomized virtual items.’109 The ESA’s proposal would have a global

reach and will likely better protect many consumers across the world. The ESA also 
identified that several major game publishers already disclose such information in 
their games.110 Apple and Google both also require probability disclosures for games 
published on their respective app stores which contain paid loot boxes.111 
 
4.1.1. Discretion as to the method of compliance is problematic 
Probabilities disclosures do not restrict consumer choice, but only seek to 
better inform it. Similar disclosure requirements are imposed in regards to gambling 
in other jurisdictions ‘to enable the customer to make an informed decision about his 
or her chances of winning.’112 However, when discretion is given to gambling 
operators as to the amount; format and location of how such information is to be 
presented to consumers, gambling operators have arguably chosen suboptimal 
methods in order to misguide consumers.113 In the PRC, significant discretion is 
allowed to game companies as to where the probabilities should be disclosed: 
disclosures made either in-game on the loot box purchase page or the game’s official 
website are both compliant with the law.114 However, arguably, a disclosure made 
in-game on the loot box’s purchase page would appear more prominently to the 
consumer than a disclosure made on an official website, whose existence the player

may not even be aware of. A disclosure made in-game would accordingly arguably 
be more likely to be read, and therefore be more effective at informing consumers 
and preventing overspending.  
 
The PRC law also did not set out requirements as to how accessible the 
disclosures ought to be. For example, the disclosure in certain games can only be 
accessed if the player interacts with a tiny question mark hidden away in a corner of 
the loot box purchase screen; for other games, the disclosure can only be accessed 
after the player follows multiple hyperlinks on the official website. The disclosure 
could readily be provided more prominently and be more easily accessible, but 
many game companies have chosen not to provide this information in the most 
effective way. Indeed, the probabilities disclosure could be an automatic pop-up 
(with audio effects, such as an alarm sound) that interrupts purchase when the 
player attempts to buy loot boxes. Such an intrusive disclosure may be more 
effective at alerting the consumers as to the probabilities of obtaining rewards and 
preventing overspending. 
 
Apple, Google and the ESA have similarly not specified where the 
probabilities should be disclosed and how accessible the disclosure should be. The 
PRC law, and existing and prospective self-regulation, can be improved: specific 
requirements as to how, when and where probabilities disclosures should be made 
may ensure that disclosures are easy to access and understand, and are made at 
similar locations in all games, thus ensuring players playing multiple games and 
players playing a new game would readily be able to find the disclosures, and 
therefore be more effective at informing consumer choice and preventing 
overspending. Compliance rate with the PRC legal obligation (and Apple and 
    31  
Google’s existing self-regulation) to disclosure probabilities in general, and the 
discretionary methods of compliance that game companies have chosen to adopt 
have not been assessed empirically. Future research should examine these aspects to 
better inform future legal regulation and/or self-regulation. 
 
4.1.2. Enforcement is necessary to ensure consumer confidence 
A flaw with probabilities disclosures is that players cannot verify and thus be 
confident that the probabilities disclosed by the game companies are accurate. This is 
especially true in relation to voluntary disclosures and disclosures which are not 
scrutinised through some form of enforcement. Indeed, the PRC law did not specify 
how it will be enforced and it is unclear how the law is currently being enforced, if at 
all.115 Apple and Google’s existing self-regulation similarly appears to be based on 
trust and the probabilities disclosed by game companies are not scrutinised by either 
platform provider. 
 
In contrast, the South Korean self-regulation system, organised by K-GAMES 
(Korea Association of Game Industry), which provides a certification system that 
‘incentivises’ disclosure, has an enforcement system as set out in the Enforcement 
Rules of Self-regulation Code for Healthy Game Culture.116 Article 11 explains that the 
compliance of the most popular games on each platform will be monitored every 
month.117 Article 12 details that: for the first instance of identified non-compliance, 
the game company will be advised as to how it can comply; for the second offence, 
 
115 The Author reasons from anecdotal evidence that limited enforcement is carried out when 
competing game companies scrutinise and report each other, and when consumers report games that 
they are playing, to the PRC’s official consumer protection hotline. 
116 See K-GAMES (n 108) 40–43. 
117 ibid 42. 
32     
the company will be warned that it is non-compliant; and for the third offence, the 
company’s violation will be identified and published to inform consumers and it 
will also be decertified.118 K-GAMES’ monthly ‘name-and-shame’ admirably does 
not collude with influential game companies and does not discriminate against 
smaller game companies by only targeting them: Dota 2 (2013), one of the most 
popular MOBA games developed and published by Valve, a leading international 
video game company that developed and operates Steam, is prominently published 
at the top of the name and shame list for repeated non-compliance.119 
 
4.1.3. Voluntary self-regulation has no teeth and may be ignored 
K-GAMES’ self-regulatory system is exemplary: the PRC law; Apple and 
Google’s existing self-regulation; and the ESA’s prospective self-regulation should 
emulate K-GAMES’ enforcement system by ensuring that the probabilities 
disclosures made by companies are accurate and can be trusted by consumers. 
However, it must be noted that even with a robust self-regulatory system, such as K-
GAMES’, some games remain non-compliant but continue to be popular with 
consumers. For example, Valve’s Dota 2 has been declared non-compliant 19 times as 
of June 2020 by K-GAMES without inspiring any change to Dota 2’s non-compliance 
and Valve’s non-cooperation,120 which means that consumers remain at risk of 
potential harm. Indeed, self-regulation may not ultimately be effective as measures

remain voluntary. Decertification, and name-and-shame may not be sufficiently 
strong disincentives. Legal sanctions, such as fines and injunctions against the 
continued non-compliant operation of such games, may be the only reliable solution 
in such cases to guarantee compliance and consumer protection. A combination of 
the binding force of law and a robust enforcement regime may be a satisfactory first 
step to ameliorating the potential harms of loot boxes by responsibly informing 
consumers of the (un)likelihood of obtaining rewards and the potential harms of 
paid loot boxes. 
 
4.2. Maximum spending limit 
As argued in Section 2.5.2. above,121 the most concerning issue with loot boxes 
is overspending. More ethically designed implementations are defensible and need 
not necessarily be prohibited. The probabilities disclosure measure discussed above 
may assist players in making more informed decisions and therefore becoming less 
likely to overspend. However, it is possible to be more interventionist by literally 
preventing overspending by setting a maximum limit on the amount of money 
players are allowed to spend on loot boxes. 
 
In gambling contexts, ‘pre-commitment limit-setting involves users specifying 
(voluntarily or compulsorily), before engaging in gambling, the maximum they 
would like to spend. Once reached, this limit triggers a reminder message and a 
cooling-off period in which the player is unable to gamble further.’122 Pre-
commitment limit-setting is known to have a positive, if subtle, effect on reducing

Delfabbro, ‘Loot Box Limit-Setting Is Not Sufficient on Its Own to Prevent Players from 
Overspending’ (n 38).

and controlling problem gambling.123 Although it may not necessarily be the 
monetary limit itself that curtails the gambling behaviour, but rather the ‘break in 
play,’ i.e., that the gambler is forced to stop playing, cool off, step back and think 
rationally, which is effective.124 
 
The most prominent issue with setting a maximum spending limit is deciding 
how much this limit should be, as regulators would need to make the difficult 
assessment as to what is a fair and equitable amount of money to be spent on a game 
for a specific period of time.125 Drummond, Sauer and Hall recommended a monthly 
cap of US$50 (≈£38.21) on loot boxes to ensure the protection of players who would 
be classified as problem gamblers (i.e., those who would significantly overspend on 
loot boxes).126 US$50 is not necessarily the most optimal amount of money to spend 
on loot boxes for every individual consumer: indeed, US$50 may be quite a lot more 
money than many players, especially children, would be willing or allowed to spend 
on a game per month, but US$50 may also be much less than what an affluent player 
may want to spend monthly to financially support their favourite game developer. A 
monthly limit of US$50 may also be appropriate because it is close to how much a 
player would be expected to pay when purchasing a video game outright ‘as a

125 cf the PRC judiciary recently expressed perfect willingness to engage with this assessment in 
relation to how much money a particular child should be allowed to spend on video games given 
their family’s economic circumstance and the game’s ‘genre:’ their jurisprudence on this point may be 
insightful once generated, see Leon Y Xiao, ‘People’s Republic of China Legal Update: Supreme

product’127 (it is quite reasonable for such a game to be purchased, and for such an 
amount of money to be spent on video gaming, every month); and because 
monetising with loot boxes, in a non-predatory manner, and selling game titles 
outright are equally valid monetisation methods that game companies may adopt 
and therefore should be treated equally by the law. A relevant point to consider is 
that the law may be able to disincentivise the implementation of loot boxes by 
decreasing the maximum monthly spending limit on loot boxes to be lower than the 
average price of a game software to discourage game companies from monetising 
with loot boxes, as they would be forced to only be able to generate less revenue if 
they choose to monetise with loot boxes than otherwise. 
 
4.2.1. Maximum in-game spending limits in South Korea and the PRC 
Monthly maximum spending limits on online video games generally (and not 
limits on loot box spending specifically) have been imposed in South Korea and the 
PRC against players. The South Korean monthly limits were previously imposed on 
‘juveniles’ under the age of 19 at 70,000 Won (≈£44.8) and on adults at 500,000 Won 
(≈£320.02). The adult limit was set arbitrarily high and would only have been 
capable of preventing particularly extreme overspending. Notably, both South 
Korean limits ‘have since been repealed citing unfair economic discrimination 
against the video game industry as compared to other creative industries.’128 The

PRC had imposed an impractical and unreasonable monthly limit of ¥10 Renminbi 
(≈£1.10) on minors under the age of 18 in March 2011.129 This limit has been updated 
in November 2019: minors under the age of 8 are prohibited from spending any 
money at all; minors aged between 8 and 16 are allowed to spend up to ¥200 (≈£22); 
and minors aged between 16 and 18 are allowed to spend ¥400 Renminbi (£44).130 
These updated limits are more realistic; however, their regulatory effects remain to 
be seen. 
 
4.2.2. Enforcement of the limits is difficult 
Pre-commitment maximum spending limits have proven difficult to impose 
compulsorily in gambling contexts: gamblers may be able to switch to another 
service provider to evade the limit and gamble more (although this issue may be 
avoided if providers share information between each other).131 Such enforcement 
difficulties are similarly present in the video gaming context. Both South Korea and 
the PRC are countries that have universal national identification card systems that 
advantageously allow for the verification of the real-life identity of all online players 
(i.e., all user accounts must belong to a verified real-life identity), which then allows 
for the enforcement of maximum spending limits against those players across 
multiple user accounts; across different games and video gaming service providers; 
and across hardware platforms. However, identity verification regulations have

been documented to have been easily bypassed by minors in both South Korea and 
in the PRC through using the personal identification documents of others, such as 
the minor’s parents’ or the internet café operators’.132 
 
In countries without universal identification systems, e.g., the UK,133 these 
limits are even more difficult to impose against individuals.134 The alternative 
imposition of these limits against only the player’s user account, rather than the 
player’s real-life identity, can be circumvented through the creation and use of 
multiple accounts for the same game, and by simply switching to playing another 
game. However, unlike in gambling contexts where the gambling game’s game 
design cannot realistically be changed, the multiple account issue can be resolved 
through ethical game design by heavily disincentivising the player for possessing 
multiple accounts, e.g., progression through the game requires virtual items that 
cannot be directly bought using real-world money or transferred between accounts, 
and must be earned through gameplay. Admittedly, this requires the unlikely 
voluntary commitment to this measure from the entire video game industry 
(because such game design would be commercially detrimental), as otherwise the 
player would simply choose to switch to games with more unscrupulous operators. 
 
4.2.3. Maximum gameplay time limits and curfew shutdown laws 
Video gaming has also been regulated and restricted using the concept of 
time, rather than money. Such measures may not be directly applicable to loot box

38     
spending, but may provide certain insight from a regulatory perspective. Maximum 
gameplay time limits seek to limit the total amount of time that a player is allowed 
to play games. Curfew shutdown laws restrict players from playing games during 
certain times, e.g., late nights and early mornings to ensure adequate sleep time, or 
school hours to ensure attendance. Both measures are aimed towards reducing 
gameplay time rather than in-game spending; nonetheless, the implications of their 
imposition are insightful. Recently imposed rules in the PRC limit minors’ gameplay 
time to 3 hours on public holidays, including weekends, and 1.5 hours on 
weekdays.135 Curfew laws on online games have been imposed ‘between 0:00 and 
6:00 in South Korea on juveniles under the age of 16 by Article 26(1) of the Juvenile 
Protection Act (2011, No. 10659). The PRC restricts minors under the age of 18 from 
online game services between 22:00 and 8:00.136 
 
Such measures are particularly paternalistic as they severely restrict the 
liberty of the individual, which is likely why they have thus far only been imposed 
against minors. This suggests that loot box regulation may potentially also need to 
be applied differently against child and adult players, and against children of 
different ages. Temporal restriction measures have been documented to cause 
economic harm against the game industry, and have been argued to even potentially

may cause similar harms. 
 
Measures restricting gameplay time have also proven difficult to enforce 
because they are easily circumvented using the personal identification documents of 
others.138 Notably, psychology research has concluded that the South Korean curfew 
law has been ineffective from a regulatory perspective because it neither reduced 
adolescent internet usage nor increased adolescent sleeping hours, as were its 
legislative intent.139 This is meaningful for loot box regulation and suggests that 
more interventionist regulatory ‘solutions’ (such as banning all paid loot boxes) may 
not be appropriate without empirical research evidence. Such overregulation fails to 
protect consumers and harms the industry, and should be avoided. The call for 
video game companies to be socially responsible by releasing loot box purchase data 
and cooperating with independent researchers, in order to avoid harmful 
overregulation, is worth repeating. 
 
4.2.4. An ideal maximum spending limit system as applied to loot boxes 
In the Author’s view, a universal monthly US$50 limit may be too low. 
Considering individual circumstances, a particular player spending US$100 monthly 
on the only game that they play every day for many hours may not be unreasonable 
and should not be restricted. A higher monthly limit of US$200 per game should be 
set universally as law to prevent extreme overspending on one particular video

the Fourth Industrial Revolution’ (2018) 33 KISO Journal <journal.kiso.or.kr/?p=9248> accessed 21

game. Game companies are welcome to set a lower limit for their games if they deem 
it more ethical to do so (for example, a game company may voluntarily set a lower 
monthly US$30 limit for their child players). This overarching legal limit could then 
be complemented: individual players’ past spending behaviour would be examined 
in a socially responsible and benevolent manner (rather than malevolently and 
abusively to derive additional commercial gain140) to identify potential problematic 
spenders, then such users are advised as to the potential harms of overspending on 
loot boxes; provided with resources to participate in support programmes; and, 
importantly, offered the option to set limits on their own future spending on loot 
boxes. Ideally, the spending limits of various video games would be organised into 
one centralised management system using which the player may be able to set 
individual spending limits on a particular game and also a total spending limit on all 
games. 
 
Game companies do not necessarily need to implement their own maximum 
spending limit as a hard cap on spending: instead, the loot box mechanic can be 
designed to be exhaustive, such that once a predetermined amount of money is 
spent (i.e., the maximum spending limit), all rewards are guaranteed to be given to 
(or ‘won’ by) the player. It is also important to ensure that rewards do not expire or 
cannot be expended, such that players need not make repeat purchases to obtain the 
same rewards.141 Game companies can also additionally provide an alternative 
(reasonably priced) option to buy all possible rewards (or even specific rewards) 
from the loot box mechanic in a non-randomised manner for a predetermined 
amount of money. This provides the players with the choice to either engage with

the loot box mechanic for a potential chance to win the most desirable rewards at a 
discount, or to directly purchase all desired items upfront. 
 
4.3. Disabling cash out features 
‘Cash out’ features refer to methods by which in-game items can be 
transferred between players and thus gain real-world value (e.g., inter-player trading 
and auction houses). In-game item transfer systems in multiplayer games being 
misused for money laundering has been well-documented by the media in the 
PRC.142 In October 2019, the ability to cash out was disabled globally for Counter-
Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) (2012, Hidden Path Entertainment & Valve 
Corporation) by the Game’s publisher because ‘worldwide fraud networks have 
recently shifted to using CS:GO keys to liquidate their gains, [such that] nearly all key 
purchases that end up being traded or sold on the marketplace are believed to be 
fraud-sourced.’143 This may have been done in recognition of potential intermediary 
liability, as these video game features are facilitating criminality. Additionally, issues 
of the validity and legality of the transfer of ownership (potentially involving minors 
with no legal capacity) over decentralised virtual items and currency, whose value 
may be particularly volatile and subject to little, if any, oversight, also arise.144

Refund Requests Relating to Unauthorised Online Video Gaming Transactions Paid for by Minors 
(Published 15 May 2020)’ (n 125). 
42     
Game companies have complied with the Dutch gambling regulator’s 
requirement to disable cash out features, albeit sometimes unwillingly.145 The UK 
and French regulators have also recognised the possible abuse of cash out features, 
but have yet to act against demonstrable current cases (arguably a failure of their 
executive function).146 Considering existing evidence of criminal abuse, there is a 
substantial public policy reason to subject cash out features to additional regulatory 
scrutiny. Existing self-regulatory measures that discourage abusing in-game item 
transfer systems to cash out, such as by telling players not to do so and punishing 
players caught doing so by banning or restricting their user accounts,147 are 
insufficient, because abuse remains factually possible as such measures respond only 
after the abuses have occurred and after harm has already been caused. Some 
players would always be willing to risk account termination to cash out. Only the 
blanket ban of cash out features can completely prevent abuse. Until cash out 
features can be technologically secured such that they could not be abused, they 
should not be implemented in new games and should be disabled in existing games. 
 
This is the position that the Dutch regulator has enforced. Therefore, game 
companies can be reasonably expected to understand how to comply with this 
regulatory position. The UK and French regulators are also theoretically aligned 
with this position, although they have not enforced it. Video game companies are in 
a better position than gambling regulators to understand when and how in-game 
 
145 e.g., ‘While we disagree with this position, we are working to comply with Kansspelautoriteit’s 
current interpretation of these laws.’ See 2K Games, ‘Statement Netherlands’ (n 99).

item transfer systems they have implemented may be abused by players. Gambling 
regulators may not necessarily be able to identify each case easily and promptly. 
Certain currently non-compliant game companies should act now to disable cash out 
features; comply with UK and French law; and prevent potential harms to 
consumers, instead of waiting until the regulators decide to finally enforce the law 
against them. Similarly, if game companies are willing to comply with Dutch law to 
better protect consumers in the Netherlands, then they should also responsibly 
apply the same higher standard of consumer protection to all their consumers in 
every jurisdiction, rather than merely complying minimally with the law (or, in the 
case of UK and French law, be non-compliant with the law until it is enforced 
against them.) 
 
4.3. Ethical game design ‘tool box’: consumer protection measures applied 
simultaneously 
Recognising the practical difficulties with regulating using and enforcing 
ethical game design measures detailed above,148 these measures are nonetheless 
likely to be effective at reducing overspending on loot boxes to an extent and should 
still be imposed where possible. Pre-commitment limit-setting in gambling contexts 
only reduces gambling to a limited extent,149 and maximum spending limits in video 
games would be difficult to effectively impose compulsorily by regulators in all 
countries. Therefore, the imposition of any one measure (such as setting maximum 
spending limits) cannot be perceived as a singular, permanent solution to loot 
boxes.150 Multiple measures should be imposed simultaneously. The ineffectiveness 
 
148 See Xiao and Henderson (n 51). 
149 Harris and Griffiths (n 123). 
150 King and Delfabbro, ‘Loot Box Limit-Setting Is Not Sufficient on Its Own to Prevent Players from 
Overspending’ (n 38). 
44     
of the curfew law in South Korea at reducing internet usage or increasing sleeping 
hours, and its economic harms, demonstrate that the regulation of technology, 
particularly video gaming, requires a process of trial and error. The regulation of 
technology is difficult and its impact unpredictable. Therefore, regulators should 
experiment with multiple measures simultaneously with the aim of measuring their 
effects, after being sufficiently informed by empirical research. 
 
Additional ethical game design measures to consider include, amongst others: 
not offering limited-time-only loot boxes containing unique rewards, so as to not 
induce an unfair sense of artificial urgency in the player;151 not adopting the pay-to-
win model152 by not offering loot box rewards that provide a competitive 
advantage;153 and ensuring that loot box rewards can also realistically be obtained 
either through gameplay without payment or through direct (rather than 
randomised) purchase.154  
 
For ethical game design to succeed, players and game companies must be 
accepting of the concept. Xiao and Henderson argued that players may be averse to 
these measures and perceive them as paternalistic.155 However, on the contrary, it is 
especially encouraging that a survey of Norwegian gamblers has demonstrated that

unsustainable from a game design perspective as more and more powerful items need to be created,

    45  
four-fifths of them have a positive attitude towards maximum spending limits, even 
though it was compulsorily imposed, and that very few actually sought alternative 
operators after they reached their limit.156 Therefore, players can be reasonably 
expected to support these ethical game design measures once they appreciate that 
these measures are implemented for their protection. 
 
Admittedly, there are practical difficulties with convincing video game 
companies to voluntarily adopt these measures as many of them are plainly not 
commercially beneficial as their adoption will negatively impact revenue.157 A few 
established game companies have voluntarily implemented some of these principles 
to a certain degree:158 for example, Path of Exile (2013, Grinding Gear Games) and 
Overwatch only sell loot boxes containing cosmetic items which do not confer 
competitive advantages, and Hearthstone allows the possibility for players to obtain 
all loot box rewards through gameplay and provides uses for duplicate rewards to 
ensure that they would still be somewhat useful.159 There may be certain, albeit 
limited, potential PR (public relations) benefits to adopting ethical game design, i.e., 
the media and the public choosing to give recognition and business to certain game 
companies for their demonstrated social responsibility. For example, video gaming 
media widely reported on Fortnite’s implementation of X-Ray Llamas and Epic 
Game’s commitment to ‘loot box transparency.’160 Indeed, public and commercial 
pressures can encourage ethical game design practices from the industry and ensure

their adoption: consumers should exert pressure by voting with their wallet and 
choosing to spend their money only on ethically designed video games, and 
governments should through discretionary grants and tax relief incentivise the 
cessation of the implementation of potentially abusive game mechanics and the 
adoption of ethical game design principles.161 
 
The adoption of ethical game design also has the long-term benefit of 
ensuring that game companies would not seek to invent other potentially abusive 
mechanics to replace loot boxes after loot boxes become regulated, and thereby force 
academics and regulators to again scramble to identify the potential harms of 
another newly invented monetisation method and justify their regulation, whilst 
exposing consumers to potential harms in the meantime before regulation is finally 
again made. 
 
4.4. Past instances of minimal compliance by game companies sowed distrust 
Voluntary self-regulation is likely the best solution, if all elements of the video 
game industry can be trusted to comply and endeavour to ensure consumer 
protection to the best of their abilities. Unfortunately, self-regulation alone as a 
solution must be treated with scepticism because major game companies have often 
only acted when explicitly regulated against and have not sought to promote 
consumer protection to the fullest and uniformly across jurisdictions.162

Consumers in Belgium are now protected from the potential harms of all paid 
loot boxes only because of the regulatory action of the Belgian gambling regulator;163 
consumers in the Netherlands are protected from cash out features, but not from 
overspending on paid loot boxes that do not contain rewards that are worth real-
world money, because of the comparatively more limited regulatory action of the 
Dutch gambling regulator;164 and consumers in the UK and France and most other 
countries remain largely unprotected from cash out features and overspending, 
because of a lack of substantive regulatory action. 
 
The disclosure of the probabilities of obtaining rewards from loot boxes was 
initially published only because of the imposition of PRC law and only in Simplified 
Chinese for the benefits of PRC players.165 Although the disclosures were often 
immediately translated into English and published online by dedicated players for 
the benefits of international players, technically and officially, the disclosures have 
not been made available to players from non-PRC countries. Game companies have 
not endeavoured to provide this information as soon as possible to all players in 
manners most accessible to them, and only complied minimally by providing this 
information to PRC players.

5. Conclusion: a combined legal and self-regulatory approach to loot boxes 
The level of consumer protection provided by game companies often depends 
on the legal regulation in place, which is why it is necessary for legal regulation to 
set a minimum acceptable standard to ensure a sufficient degree of consumer 
protection, in the absence of proactive voluntary self-regulation. The best solution 
going forward with loot box regulation may be for the law to set a minimum 
standard that does not overregulate, and for self-regulation to complement the legal 
regime by thriving to achieve an even higher standard of consumer protection. 
 
In terms of the two types of paid loot boxes, this combined approach would 
require that the law either prohibit, or regulate as licensed gambling, loot boxes 
whose rewards are worth real-world money, depending on whether or not gambling 
is either prohibited or regulated in the jurisdiction, so as to potentially allow video 
gaming companies to expand into the regulated gambling industry in certain 
jurisdictions. The combined regulatory approach would ensure that loot boxes 
whose rewards are worth real-world money cannot be sold to children (which 
addresses an issue of particular concern to academics; regulators; policymakers; the 
media; and the public) and that their sale to adults will be strictly scrutinised (and 
taxed) as gambling by regulators. Cash out features should be restricted by law 
(which should be strictly enforced) at present until they can be technologically 
secured, at which point the law may be disapplied and cash out features will be self-
regulated as game companies would be in a better position to identify and prevent 
abuse. 
 
    49  
The other type of paid loot boxes, those whose rewards are not worth real-
world money, need not necessarily be prohibited or regulated as gambling (and in 
fact, in the Author’s view, should not be). To prevent overspending, a reasonable but 
considerably high maximum spending limit (which may be set at different values for 
adults and children, and for children of various ages, and thus should resolve 
academics’; regulators’; policymakers’; the media’s; and the public’s particular 
concern as to children overspending on loot boxes) should be imposed as law, and 
game companies should be encouraged to complement this legal requirement by 
restricting player spending further by imposing lower spending limits, or by 
ensuring that all loot box rewards are guaranteed to be obtained for a predetermined 
and reasonable amount of money. 
 
To facilitate the adoption of ethical game design, where possible, the law 
should impose certain ethical game design measures as law: for example, the 
obligation to disclose probabilities of obtaining rewards. The law should detail a 
specific and uniform way to communicate such information to players, that is 
sufficiently prominent and easy to understand, and the law should contain an 
enforcement regime that is capable of punishing non-compliant game companies. 
Game companies should be encouraged to improve on the legal requirement by 
providing additional, even more prominent and easy-to-understand ways for 
players to access probabilities disclosures. Other ethical game design measures 
which cannot realistically be codified (because they would require the arguably 
impossible exercise of subjective discretion by a yet-to-be-established regulatory 
body166) should be promoted to game companies through incentives, such as a 
certification regime, discretionary grants and tax relief. Instead of having a 
 
166 See Xiao and Henderson (n 51) 11–12. 
50     
prospective regulator decide what is ethical game design per se and prohibit ‘abusive 
game design,’ the video game industry should lead this effort as its members are in 
the best position to evaluate the ‘ethics’ of game design. Finally, consumers should 
be informed of the benefits of ethical game design and encouraged to support only 
ethically designed video games.
