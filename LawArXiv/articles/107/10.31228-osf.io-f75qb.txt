1. Scope of the study and research methods. 
It does not seem controversial that intellectual property laws are not fit for the fashion 
industry.1 It usually follows the call on lawmakers to amend existing laws in order to ensure 
that creativity be rewarded.2 Some have argued that there would be no need for reforms, 
because fashion is regulated by social norms,3 and the industry ‘benefits from widespread 
copying.’4 This would mean, for instance, that generally designers would refrain from copying 
in compliance with the fashion community’s norms, regardless of whether said copying is

lawful or not. Researchers5 recently have shown how the regulation of creativity by social 
norms is not necessarily a positive fact. In the same vein, this author has been carrying out 
empirical qualitative research to map social norms and how these are interwoven with the 
imbalance of power throughout the fashion’s supply chain. If the law, including intellectual 
property law, is not a primary concern for the players of the industry, potential reforms risk 
being useless, if not accompanied by broader interventions that address said imbalance. 
Fashion is a reminder that economic rewards are not the only incentive to creativity. However, 
one should not take for granted that alternative incentives be better than intellectual property 
rights. 
In terms of research methods, alongside a EU- and UK-based legal analysis, this author 
in-depth interviewed eighteen fashion stakeholders, eight of which working on the creative side 
of fashion,6 ten on the legal one.7 Snowball sampling was followed to reflect the quasi-sectary 
features  of  the  fashion  industry.8  The  difficulty  to  find  fashion  creatives  willing  to  be 
interviewed  may  confirm  such  depiction  of  the  fashion  community.  Unlike  quantitative 
research, qualitative methods do not aim to be representative of the entire relevant population, 
nor to present results that could be universally generalised.9 Therefore, despite the relatively 
low number of interviews, clear threads have been emerging, hence this author decided to 
present the results based on the collected data. Future research should attempt to broaden the 
sample including representatives of all the professional categories involved in the industry. 
 
2. Imbalance of power in the fashion industry 
When this author approached some fashion stakeholders saying that he wanted to 
interview them about power inequalities, most of them made the assumption that the focus

6 These included representative of different professions, such as buyers, models, fashion communication lecturers, 
designers,  social  media  managers,  and  independent  brands.  Three  of  the  interviewees  were  the  legal 
representatives of important organisations representing the interests of their profession. All participants asked to 
remain anonymous.  
7 These were Fashion Law lecturers, PhD students in Fashion Law, IP practitioners in the UK, Italy, and Greece , 
IP lecturers and professors, and employment lawyers. 
8 IM Dragan and A Isaic-Maniu, ‘Snowball sambling completion’ (2013) 5(2) Journal of Studies in Social 
Sciences 160 underline how snowball sampling is ideal for closed groups and hidden populations, but they admit 
that there is a major disadvantage, i.e. “the absence of objective, quantitative criteria in taking a decision to 
conclude the investigation” (ibid 160).

would have been on the outsourcing of part of the manufacture to factories in developing 
countries where the standard of protection of human rights and employment rights is often 
lower  than  the  European  one.10  In  2017,  Oxfam  denounced  how  powerful  brands  are 
responsible for the poverty of workers in countries like Bangladesh, where only 2% of the price 
paid for an item of clothing goes towards factory wages.11 The issue is worsened by tax 
avoidance practices that do not make possible a redistribution of wealth.12The problem is 
closely related to the lack of transparency in the supply chain; most of the biggest global fashion 
and apparel brands and retailers do not disclose sufficient (if at all) information about their 
suppliers,  their  practices,  and  socio-environmental  impact.13  While  the  sustainability  is 
increasingly on many companies’ agenda,14 the commitment is still overall low and not 
growing fast enough.15 However, the blockchain could be an important tool to achieve an 
ethical fashion by making the supply transparent.16 
Even though human rights are a primary concern, this research project moved from the 
intuition that power inequalities was a much more pervasive phenomenon in the fashion 
industry17 and, therefore, aimed at mapping it throughout the supply chain. For instance, a 
study found that there is an imbalance of power between Western original brand manufacturers’ 
buyers and Chinese original equipment manufacturers’ suppliers.18 However, more recent 
trends seem to suggest that the balance of power is shifting in favour of Asian companies.19 
Said imbalance can have devastating consequences when it leads to sexual harassment, as 
uncovered in November 2017 by some British models with regards to the abuses perpetrated

by photographers.20 Edie Campbell, in particular, denounces a huge power imbalance that is at 
the basis of an ‘unspoken contract’21 according to which models give up ownership of their 
body. Similarly, male model Cory Bond, in talking about him being sexually assaulted and 
drugged, pointed out that he never spoke out because the assailants were powerful and he did 
not want to lose his job.22 This may be read in the context of the more general problem of 
‘gender power imbalance throughout the industry.’23  In 2018, similar episodes were reported24 
and the public outrage that followed led to Vogue terminating the accused photographers’ 
contracts25 and Condé Nast adopting a code of conduct to prevent power abuses.26 More 
recently, some have denounced the dominance of so-called influencers, although brands are 
expected to ‘right the power imbalance’27 in growing influencer marketing industry. Some 
positive changes must be acknowledged. The power imbalance between designers and models 
allowed the imposition of very unhealthy lifestyle, but LVMH28 and Kering29 joining forces to 
end the use of size zero models is a step forward,30 even though much still needs to be done to 
re-balance the relevant relationship.31 Sometimes, competition law has been used to address

power imbalance. For example, a number of modelling agencies were fined for colluding on 
prices thus harming high-street chains, online fashion retailers and consumer goods brands.32 
However, this route is not always viable, as shown by the Court of Justice in Coty v Akzente,33 
where a luxury brand was allowed to impose restrictive distribution agreements excluding 
third-party ecommerce platforms.34 
 
2.1.   Initial thesis. Inequality of bargaining power as a unifying principle 
and good faith.  
Traditional contract law is based on the assumption that transactions occur between 
parties that are on the same level in terms of power. One of the theoretical merits of EU 
consumer law has been to reverse the assumption and build a legal sub-system that is protective 
of vulnerable parties, whose weakness depends primarily on information asymmetries.35 
Imbalance of power is addressed by consumer protection laws that render a number of 
contractual clauses unenforceable and by giving judges the power to change the content of 
business-to-consumer  (B2C)  contracts.  However,  fashion  inequalities  are  more  often  in 
business-to-business (B2B) relationships, rather than in B2C ones. Therefore, it is crucial to 
assess if there are corrective mechanisms in place and if they are sufficient. 
This researcher’s thesis was that an answer to the problem could have been considering 
the imbalance of bargaining power as a unifying principle in contract law, hence overcoming 
the rigidities of the established categories of vitiation.

Lord Denning MR, in Lloyds Bank Ltd. v Bundy36 suggested that there is in English law 
a general principle of inequality of power, by which agreements are voidable if resulting from 
said inequality. In particular,  
English law gives relief to one who, without independent advice, enters into a contract 
upon terms which are very unfair (…) when his bargaining power is grievously impaired by 
reason of his own needs or desires, or by his ignorance or infirmity, coupled with undue 
influences or pressures brought to bear on him by or for the benefit of the other.37 
The existence of the principle has not been accepted by most scholars38 and subsequent 
case law,39 but recently it has been suggested that a ‘unifying principle is discernible, but that 
it should be formulated alternatively as “exploitation of constrained autonomy”.’40 However, 
the prevailing idea41 is that a contract can be voided at common law or in equity only for duress, 
undue influence, and unconscionable bargains. One has to add to this the statutory restrictions 
to freedom of contract introduce by Parliament to protect certain categories, such as consumers, 
employees, tenants, and investors. 
The doctrines of duress, undue influence, and unconscionable bargains could be unified 
under the principle of inequality of bargaining power, since principles at common law can be 
developed building on policies expressed by statutory regimes.42 As per Sir Thomas Bingham 
in Timeload Ltd v British Telecommunications plc,43 the common law could use protective 
statutes also beyond their scope ‘as a platform for invalidating or restricting the operation of 
an oppressive clause.’44 The initial hope of this study was to provide evidence that the 
phenomenon  of  inequality  of  bargaining  power  is  becoming  a  structural  element  of 
contemporary transactions. New protective policies to address the inequalities in the fashion

industry might have contributed to the acceptance on the inequality of bargaining power as a 
unifying principle. 
Another route that this author envisaged as a way to re-balance the relationship 
throughout the fashion supply chain was good faith. Leggatt J in Yam Seng  Pte Ltd  v 
International Trade Corp Ltd45 innovatively argued that a general term of good faith may be 
implied under certain conditions. This concept is still far from being accepted,46 but courts 
seem increasingly inclined to imply good faith terms, especially in relational and long-term 
contracts,47  which  raised  the  hopes  of  many  as  to  its  potential  as  a  general  organising 
principle.48 This study aimed to explain several doctrines as expressions of the duty of good 
faith (e.g. duress and inequality of bargaining power), which in turn could have rectified some 
of inequalities in the fashion industry. Thus, in a cross-fertilisation process, good faith could 
have been an argument for the recognition of the unifying principle of inequality and, in turn, 
the latter will be a piece of the good-faith puzzle.
