From ‘Capital and Ideology’ to ‘Democracy and Evidence’: a review of Thomas Piketty 
Ewan McGaughey1 
Abstract
Thomas Piketty’sCapital and Ideology(2020) is a major, encyclopaedic and data-driven contribution to the effort of
constructing a better human civilization. This review summarises the main argument: a positive thesis that in every
society, ideology feeds laws and institutions that create inequality, and inequality then bolsters ideology; a normative
thesis that we need a better ideology, including ‘participatory socialism’, to solve our biggest challenges. The review
then complements and critiques three central issues in the argument, that (1) the true concentration of economic
power, the votes in the economy, is even more extreme than inequality of wealth and income, (2) the legal
construction of markets, through property, contract, corporate, or human rights law, can ‘pre-distribute’ income and
wealth to a vast extent before tax, and (3) social justice means expanding (not merely correcting or re-distributing)
everyone’s opportunity, creative capacity, and human potential, and helps everyone to develop their personality to
the fullest. Social justice is an unparalleled force, and is still the best answer to far-right, authoritarian or other failed
ideologies, which have escalated inequality and driven climate damage. Perhaps the greatest achievement of Piketty’s
work could be to bring economics firmly back to the values in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

1. THE MAIN ARGUMENT
InCapital and Ideology, Thomas Piketty’s positive argument is that societies use ideology to justify (often
unjustified) inequality. In an ongoing cycle, inequality then feeds ideology. Ideology (which is not always
based on reason and evidence) tends to be a ‘range of contradictory discourses’. These discourses create a
‘dominant narrative’. The narrative leads to rules. The rules bolster inequality.2 And inequality generates
more ideology.3 ‘We live in an era’, writes Piketty, ‘that wants to see itself as postideological but is in reality
saturated  by  ideology.’4  Nineteenth  century  ideology  ‘sacralized’  private  property,  promising  ‘social
stability’ and ‘individual emancipation’ if the state was laissez-faire.5 The Soviet Union had an ideology of
state ownership under a dictatorship “of” the proletariat that revolutionised a corrupt old order.6 The
European Union has, says Piketty, told a tale that ‘free competition and free circulation of goods and
capital’ is enough for ‘prosperity and social harmony’.7 Post-Soviet Russia in general, and Putin in

discourses describing how society should be structured.’ cf K Marx, The German Ideology (1845) Part I.A.

Sabena (No 2) (1976) Case 43/75, that it ‘is not merely an economic union, but is at the same time intended, by common
1particular, follows an ideology that seeks to ‘restore Russia’s greatness’ based on ‘hierarchy and verticality
in both politics and economics’, mocking ‘Gorbachev’s egalitarian illusions and his obsession with saving
socialism’, before Yeltsin and then the oligarchs took charge.8 China’s official ideology is ‘socialism with
Chinese characteristics’, and these ‘characteristics’ happily include dictators and billionaires controlling its
so called National “People’s” Congress.9 Euro-American capitalism, epitomised by Thatcher or Reagan,
and leading to far-right identitarian or nativist politics, espoused a return to laissez-faire.10 
By contrast, social democracy in the 20th century broke away from the monolith of 19th century
private property, and attempted to build institutions for public property, social property, or ‘temporary’
property, circulating wealth by tax.11 But, says Piketty, social democratic parties have not yet answered the
problems of creating fair ownership, universal education, fair tax, and a just society beyond the nation-
state.12 A ‘just society’, says Piketty, is one where ‘all members’ of society have ‘access’ to ‘fundamental
goods’, like ‘education, health, the right to vote’, and can participate in ‘social, cultural, economic, civil and
political life’. The ‘least advantaged’ should be able to ‘enjoy the highest possible life conditions’. That may
allow some inequality, but not the extremes we see now.13 
Piketty’s normative argument is for ‘participatory socialism’, and he writes this should mean three
main things. First, we need to extend democracy in the economy, with worker votes for company boards
‘in its maximal version’, for example ‘with half the board seats in all private firms, large or small, given to
workers’, and also create ‘true social ownership of capital’.14 There should be an overhaul of the ‘labor
code and, more generally, the entire legal system’ to achieve ‘a just wage’ and ‘a more equal distribution of
economic power’.15 Second, we must have a ‘system of progressive taxation of wealth’ based on ‘ability to
pay’.16 As well as income tax, inheritance tax, and a progressive tax on carbon emissions, a new system of
wealth tax should pay for ‘a universal capital endowment, and an ambitious social state’. This includes,
among other things, universal education to enable truly equal opportunity.17 Third, we should enhance
fiscal cooperation within the EU and beyond, and ensure the terms of trade are more balanced, including
more developmental assistance to at least 1% of GDP.18 The ‘message’ of this book is crystal clear: we
need a better ideology.19 That is an ideal of justice, founded on democracy and evidence.

is still up to the EU and all citizens to choose which tradition we want.

22. IDEOLOGY AND EVIDENCE
Capital and Ideology is an encyclopaedic, data driven, and intensely rewarding work, spanning the world’s
modern history and contemporary politics. It requires some thinking, slow, not fast. Fast thinking, I
suspect, is one of the main creatures on which ideology preys. This is because as behavioural economist
Daniel Kahneman put it, our minds tend to have two systems of thought.20 ‘System 1’ is our snap
judgement faculty, where we deploy a rule of thumb for common situations, to give quick answers, often
based on prior experience or choices.21 ‘System 2’ is our more slow, deliberative thinking, as we should use
if we engage in a seminar, read a book, or write a review.22 The stories we tell ourselves as a society often
set the default in our thinking, and ideology may deliberately paper over the chasms. We may think we live
in ‘the land of opportunity’, when our opportunities have been worsening for four decades.23 We may say
we have a ‘property-owning democracy’,24 when most ‘owners’ are mortgaged to the hilt to a bank.25 Big
tech and internet media claim they ‘bring the world closer together’,26 when higher internet penetration
under Facebook, Google, Twitter, Tencent or VK has directly led to more fascism,27 genocide,28 televised
executions and torture,29 and an astonishing descent into hateful public discourse. 
The way we defeat bad ideology – from the Soviet Stalinists to Silicon billionaires – is we patiently
explain how reality works, provide evidence and data, and propose alternatives. Then we create political
movements to achieve the goals. Plans are important. Details matter. Yet the most effective coalitions are
built on principles that accommodate a plurality of views, telling a story grounded in people’s experience.
Even if readers ofCapital and Ideology differ on certain points, or find some chapters more appealing than
others, Piketty’s book contains so much revealing data, is so vast in scope, that it counts as a major
contribution to the effort of constructing a better human civilization. 
highlights include the evidence-free assertion that the ‘disincentive effects of welfare state policies’ and the lack of ‘flexibility
of the labor market’ cause unemployment, so job security creates a ‘tradeoff’ or following Richard Layard it apparently must
be that ‘some people end up on the scrap-heap’. ‘Any tax or transfer payment distorts incentives’, asserts Krugman (but
apparently property and contract laws do not). P Krugman, ‘Past and prospective causes of high unemployment’ (1994) 79(4)

22 cf R Rajan (25 February 2020)Financial Times, who resorts to a career-long monologue rather than basing his review on
Piketty’s book: ‘Piketty’s single-minded focus on taxation and redistribution blinkers his overall vision. [This is wrong as Piketty
focuses on labour rights and economic democracy, or questions of ‘pre-distribution’.] Tax policy cannot be the only cause of inequality
(especially given evasion). [Piketty says the opposite: the legal structure of markets also drive inequality.] Trade, technology, winner-takes-
all markets and antitrust regulation find little place in his narrative of the rise in inequality. [Rajan must not have read chapter 12 in
particular, or the book in general, which heavily concerns fair trade.] And greater government spending cannot be the only solution...’
[Piketty’s other solutions are labour rights, democratisation of the economy, and better public services, which Rajan presumably opposes too.]

33. CAPITAL AND DEMOCRACY
In this review I would like to focus on three main points, which could be useful to complement, critique
and emphasise the main argument of the book. These are that (1) the inequality of economic power is
even more extreme than inequality of wealth and income, (2) the legal construction of markets can go very
far to pre-empt unjustified inequality, before redistributive taxation, and (3) social justice, based on
universal human rights, is a creative and unparalleled force, and this must replace the ideologies persistent
in economics and law. 
(1) THE TRUE CONCENTRATION OF ECONOMIC POWER 
The first point is that Piketty rightly emphasises the astonishing levels of concentration in income and
wealth. But if we measure it, inequality of economic power, mainly through voting in the economy, is even
more extreme. How power in politics works is familiar. In a democracy it starts with ‘one person, one
vote’, ‘administration is in the hands of the many, not the few,30 we have standards for equal expression of
voice and election spending,31 and we aim for a media that encourages deliberative discourse through
public reason. 
By contrast, power in the economy is less familiar than it should be. Major enterprises, mostly
organised in corporate form, are the centres. Corporate directors set our wages, fund retirement, pay
dividends, set investment levels, choose their tax strategy, allocate resources, and affect our environment.
Boards of directors, under multiple corporate laws, mainly appoint and pay themselves.32 Supply and
demand in certain markets set outer boundaries for manoeuvre in price setting, but within those bounds,
actual prices are determined by corporate, contractual and bargaining power, founded on law. In most
legal systems, there are also rights for company members to vote and remove directors by a majority.33 But
most members’ votes are monopolised by shareholders, except to the extent that workers also have voice.
It is true that ‘the principle of “one share, one vote”’ prevails in Europe, typically in law.34 But in the last
two decades, particularly in tech corporations like Google, Facebook, Uber, Snap, or Alibaba, founding
directors have been allowed to issue masses of multiple-voting shares to themselves, or even non-voting
shares to others.35 ‘One share, one vote’ was protected by law in the US since the Great Depression, but

31 R (Animal Defenders International) v Secretary of State for Culture Media and Sport [2008]UKHL 15, [47]-[48] per Baroness Hale, ‘In
the United Kingdom, and elsewhere in Europe, we do not want our government or its policies to be decided by the highest
spenders. Our democracy is based upon more than one person one vote. It is based on the view that each person has equal
value.’ 
32 e.g. UK Corporate Governance Code 2019prov 17, Companies (Model Articles) Regulations 2008,para 23, ‘Directors are
entitled to such remuneration as the directors determine’. Delaware General Corporation Law, §141(h) and (k). 
33 Companies Act 2006s 168 (50%). Aktiengesetz 1965§103 (75%). Code de commerce,art L.225-61 (50%). cf EU Shareholder
Rights Directive 2007/36/ECart 6, which requires member states to enable shareholders with 5% of shares to make
proposals, but nothing on board removal. In the US, the DGCL §141(k) enables companies to have ‘staggered boards’ where
directors cannot be removed by a simple vote unless there is also ‘cause’, and that inevitably leads to directors litigating to
keep their positions, and extremely large payouts to leave. 
34 Institutional Shareholder  Services, Shearman & Sterling and European Corporate  Governance Institute,Report on the
Proportionality Principle in the European Union (12 June 2007) explaining on this point, the US is an extreme outlier. 
35 See D Crichton, ‘Congress should demand Zuckerberg move to ‘one share, one vote’ (9 April 2018) TechCrunch, T
4has now been emptied.36 Despite taking money at public offerings, these founders are accountable to no
investor, no worker, and no stakeholder but themselves. 
Even when shares do come with equal votes, those votes are monopolised by asset managers (in
countries with flat state pensions like the UK and US), or banks (in countries with income-linked state
pensions, like France and Germany). The money mostly belongs to people saving for retirement. Savers in
pension, life insurance and mutual funds (e.g. a 401(k)) tend to delegate funds to asset managers and
banks. These firms choose what shares, bonds, or securities to buy, and also provide the ‘service’ of voting
on shares. But we do not yet have clear rules to make them follow voting policies the real investors want. 
Let us take just two examples. First, in the US there are 3 big asset managers: BlackRock, State
Street and Vanguard. If they were combined, the ‘big 3’ would be the largest shareholder in 438 out of the
Standard & Poors 500 listing of largest companies.37 There are around 50 people in the corporate
governance departments of these firms almost single-handedly controlling all these votes.38 Worse, they
follow the preferences of an even smaller group of directors of the asset manager firms. This means ‘in
the near future roughly twelve individuals will have practical power over the majority of U.S. public
companies.’39 Second, in Germany, there are 3 big banks: Deutsche Bank, Commerzbank, and UniCredit
(which controls HypoVereinsbank). There are 31 directors of these 3 banks, and in practice a smaller
number who set voting priorities. Until statistics were discontinued in 2005, we know German banks
controlled over 60% of all votes cast on shares in German public companies.40 Now we are blindfolded
when it comes to voting power data, like in the US, UK, or France, and this resembles the problems of
opacity Piketty highlights for wealth data.41 But you do not need up to date statistics to know that as
Adam Smith put it, these are other people’s votes, bought with ‘other people’s money’.42 The main goal of
banks and asset managers is to extract more fees, and take more from other people’s retirement. By
dealing with this issue, we could raise every senior citizen’s income, and increase social security. 
So, how should the monopoly on votes in the economy by asset managers and banks be undone?
Piketty rightly focuses on the need to increase worker participation in corporate governance, a right that
came originally from collective bargaining, and was then codified into law.43 This could mean, as Piketty
says, increasing the proportion of worker-directors on company boards, guaranteeing workers votes in

5company meetings as members (alongside shareholders),44 increasing the powers of elected work councils
to make management decisions,45 and probably all three. Some form of law guaranteeing workers rights to
vote for boards is now the majority practice in the EU and OECD countries, and even those behind like
the UK, US, or Belgium, now have seen major political proposals to achieve this fundamental right.46 In
the US, there are now expressions of support from Kamala Harris and Barack Obama. Any Democratic
state (like any EU member state) could legislate, even without the federal government.47 A huge majority
of American public opinion supports more workplace democracy: in one poll at least 53% of voters
support the right of workers to elect directors on boards, including 75% of Democratic voters, and 43%
of Republican voters, with very few opposed.48 In Europe, this is way overdue, because ‘the right of
workers to take part in the determination and improvement of the working conditions’ is enshrined in the
European Social Charter 1996.49 It is arguably part of the universal right ‘to take part in the government’
and to ‘take part in the conduct of public affairs’.50 This is the 21st century suffrage movement, for
democracy in our economy just as in politics, and to realise 21st century human rights. 
But even a ‘maximal version’ of workplace democracy is not enough,51 because capital also
belongs to workers.52 As Piketty writes, if workers had voice through their capital, particularly organised
by ‘some collective entity such as a pension fund, new dynamics might emerge.’53 This part is perhaps
even more vital, because it is even more opaque, and less understood. In the UK and US, occupational
pension funds have been larger, because the state pension is smaller.54 Trade unions had long bargained
for votes and joint control for who was on pension trustee boards. But as pension funds neared their peak
in the 1980s, after writers spoke of Pension Fund Socialism,55 a concerted attack was made on their power,
including the ‘smashing and scattering’ of collective defined benefit funds into 401(k) plans or so called
‘contract’ pensions.56 Smaller funds always needed to delegate investment services to professional asset
managers, who charged more fees and took over voting. Meanwhile, banks in continental Europe acquired

6voting control over shares that were deposited with them by law. In Germany, the law dates from a bank
cartel agreement in 1930,57 codified by the Nazi Companies Act 1937. It was not reversed after World War
Two.58 And make no mistake: after the Nazis destroyed German democracy, murdered the unions and
nationalised the labour force,59 they wanted to rewrite corporate law to make the power of banks and
boardrooms unchallengeable, so that ‘democracy in capital will vanish just as it did in politics.’60 
Today’s problem is that asset managers and banks on Wall Street, in the City of London,
Frankfurt, La Defénse or Milan, have preferences that conflict with the true investors in capital.61 They
routinely support escalating executive pay, when the true investors want fair pay. They do nothing about
the gender pay gap, when the true investors want equality between men and women. They have continued
to finance coal, oil and gas while the planet burns, and because they are still invested in fossil fuels they fail
to vote to switch auto-makers or shippers to 100% clean energy. Whenever the true investors’ speak,
when they elect representatives, they show they want real environmental, social and governance change.
An example is the UK Association of Member Nominated Trustees and its ‘red-line voting’ policy to
instruct asset managers. Its policies on shareholder voting include setting maximum pay-ratios between
CEOs and average pay for workers, requiring companies to explain a strategy for decarbonisation, and
achieving gender and racial board diversity.62 
Good models to advance democracy in capital are found in Switzerland, the US and UK. First, in
2013, Switzerland banned banks voting on shares unless they are following instructions from pension
funds,63 a norm readily translatable to German, French or Italian law. In the US, the Dodd-Frank Act of
2010 §957 banned voting by broker-dealers on ‘significant’ issues unless following instructions,64 a norm
that  could  be  extended  to  all  unelected  asset  managers  or  banks.  Second,  there  must  be  elected
representation in all funds. The UK Pensions Act 2004 section 241 requires at least one-third elected or
union-nominated pension trustees, and under section 243 this can be extended to one-half by the
Minister.65 Both the Bernie Sanders Corporate Accountability and Democracy plan, and the UK Manifesto for
Labour Law project, would ensure every pension or capital fund has representatives elected by the real
investors, and they control voting policy. Further, there are proposals for Sovereign Wealth Funds for
workers, like 21st century Meidner plans, where the funds are transferred profits from large companies,

7and elected representatives would exercise votes on shares.66 Profit-sharing is an old idea, proposed many
times by conservatives, liberals and socialists alike, but never yet put into practice.67 As well as democracy
in existing pensions and capital funds, new, inclusive, democratic ownership funds would give countries
more autonomy from financial markets and freedom from debt. An unofficial draft EU Economic
Democracy Directive shows how all these principles can be implemented for an EU-wide system of
economic democracy, based on votes at work, votes in capital, and finally votes in public services.68 
Democratising ‘public property’ is the third pillar of a reformed economy. Placing enterprises in
public ownership is better than private monopolies, or oligopolies, when you have a representative
government. Conservatives and liberals understood this even in 19th century Britain when telegraph and
telephone lines were nationalised.69 Yet the 20th century nationalisations often followed the ‘Morrisonian
model’, after Herbert Morrison, the Labour Minister for Transport and leader of the Greater London
Council, who first made London buses public from 1933. In his view, workers and consumers might be
consulted, but they should have no votes because ‘experts’ had to be appointed to public boards.70 And
who appointed those experts? It turned out to be ministers, coincidentally, like Herbert Morrison. This led
to one of the major problems in nationalised industry: a feeling of distance and lack of responsiveness
between state-owned enterprise and the public. Unbeloved, without public voice, this is why Thatcher
could so easily sell the family silver, and squander national wealth, in reckless privatisation sprees.71 
An alternative view, possibly articulated first by French trade unions in 1920,72 and by Karl
Kautsky in Germany in 1924,73 is enterprises have three basic stakeholders: the worker, the investor, and
the consumer (or the public). When markets fail, when they do not protect the public interest, we take
enterprise into public ownership, and we regulate for fair prices,74 good standards, licensing, or subsidies.
Workers must always have voice, and a vote. Investors usually have the vote, and this is thought to be fair
66 The two major expressions are ‘Inclusive Ownership Funds’ in theLabour Party Manifesto (2019) 60, and ‘Democratic
Employee Ownership Funds’ in the Bernie Sanders plan (2019). The details remain flexible: one idea is to issue shares, but it
may seem better (if workers have votes in their company by right) to simply transfer profits to collective funds. See also the

Ownership Fund’ (2019)CommonWealth, and L Palladino, ‘The Potential Benefits of Employee Ownership Funds in the

74 e.g.Allnutt v Inglis (1810) 12 East 527, 537, per Lord Ellenborough, ‘the general principle’ is that ‘every man may fix what
price he pleases upon his own property’, but if ‘the public have a right to resort to his premises... and he have a monopoly in
them... he must, as an equivalent, perform the duty attached to it on reasonable terms’. This was adopted in Munn v Illinois, 94
US 113 (1876). Also JF Kennedy (15 March 1962) where ‘competition is not workable and Government regulation is
substituted,’ the US government would give ‘an assurance of satisfactory quality and service at fair prices.’ 
8whether those are private investors, or the state. Where consumers can ‘vote with their feet’, because
workable market conditions for competitive private enterprise exist, we rarely see consumers being
guaranteed voting rights in law,75 though consumer cooperatives do often succeed. But where market
conditions are not met, and where universal rights are at stake, people who rely on services become more
than just a ‘consumer’: they are a student, a patient, a passenger, a ratepayer, a viewer, a member. 
There are many examples of democratising public services. Cambridge University, like many,
gives voting rights in its governing body to its students as well as to a majority to its staff.76 National
Health Service foundation trusts give votes to both workers and patients, a norm inspired by Spanish
hospitals.77 The Paris water company gives votes to ratepayers in the local community.78 German state
laws ensure representation, albeit via local government, for ratepayers on boards of energy companies.79
The BBC gives voice to its viewers and listeners and, though highly limited now,80 this provides a building
block of what a participatory media could be.81 Wikipedia is the world’s biggest 5th website.82 It gives users
the right to elect just above half its board of trustees, an example of transnational, democratic, big-tech,83
and a model that could be adapted for other online network-monopolies, such as Google, Facebook, or
Twitter. Stakeholder voting rights can be guaranteed even before public ownership. In a modern system of
enterprise, voting rights for the citizen-as-consumer is embedded in our democratic culture. It is coming
to be, and should be seen as a basic norm of our modern economic constitution.84 
(2) LEGAL CONSTRUCTION OF MARKETS, AND TAX
The second main point is that the legal construction of markets can change distribution to a vast extent,
before any re-distribution by tax. As Piketty writes, the ‘level of wages and profits... depends on prevailing
institutions, rules and bargaining power... as well as on taxes and regulations’.85 Similarly, Jan Pen once
wrote that income distribution reflects the corporate ‘command structure’.86 Income accumulates into
wealth and so we may summarise a general causal pattern as follows: 
law -> corporate power -> income -> wealth
There are many more causes of ‘power’ in the wider sense (e.g. psychology), and other causes of extremely

86 J Pen, Income Distribution (Allen Lane 1971) 361 
9unequal income (e.g. lotteries) or unequal wealth (e.g. inheritance). Nevertheless, the world’s richest
people all depend on taking an unjust share of riches from other people, either through corporations or
nation-states. Their wealth comes from taking as much as they can from workers, investors, consumers,
and the public, giving as little back as possible, and calling the difference ‘profit’. The biggest threat to
democracy today, particularly evident in the US, is that politics is corrupted by money. If money can be
used in elections without limits,87 or misused in referendums without enforceable consequences,88 if voice
in the media is set by oligarch shareholders and not journalists, a different causal pattern results: 
wealth -> political power -> law
This analysis differs from assumptions in some economic theory, that presumes there is a fixed thing
called the ‘market’ and that ‘supply and demand’ determine prices.89 The reality is there are infinite types
of market, because markets themselves are ‘a web of social and fiscal regulations.’90 They are built through
contract, property, corporate, labour, consumer, securities, discrimination or environmental law. Different
configurations of these rules all change the amount that people demand or supply, and therefore prices.
The notion that law ‘interferes’ with ‘markets’ shows a total failure to grasp that there is no such thing as a
pre-law, pre-social market. There is only law and the society that creates it. To sell something that is
‘mine’, I need the state-backed coercive power of enforceable property rights to show it is ‘mine’.91
Moreover, for an enforceable contract on any terms, there is always a decision about which kind of terms
society deems just, and compatible with public policy, to lend state enforcement.92 Contrary views often
come down to an ideological nostalgia for a 19th century vision of property without responsibility,93 or
contract without rights, a nostalgia for a time when owning wealth was also necessary to vote in politics.94 
Tax tends to differ from market regulation, since tax takes away existing rights of property, or
takes a sum calculated as a percentage or fee on a transaction. While we may know that tax is the price of
civilization, psychologically, taxation often triggers a sense of injustice, and many people ‘outright reject
attempts to take money from the modestly well-off and even from billionaires’.95 Many people’s sense of
injustice at being taxed is real, and this probably comes from the ‘endowment effect’. This is the
behavioural phenomenon that people like to hold on to things, apparently because we just like things.96
Even if it is not a thing, but money, people who feel ‘endowed’ with something are averse to losing it,

equilibrium price. On the original supply and demand charts, see F Jenkin,The Graphic Representation of the Laws of Supply and
Demand and other Essays on Political Economy (1887) II. who explicitly said corn prices do not work like labour’s wages.

10even with the offer of a higher gain. In this way, we are often individually irrational. We can of course can
become more rational over time through our social and political institutions. 
This points to three main issues. First, if the unjust distribution of income and wealth can be
prevented, it is better to do this rather than (or as well as) correcting the problem after the fact. ‘Pre-
distribution’ will meet less political opposition, and the arguments can be made on their own merits: to
give everyone the right to vote at work, to vote on their money, and to vote in their public services. This is
an intrinsically moral imperative. Second, the most successful narratives of tax always speak in terms of
paying a ‘fair’ share of tax, rather than simply taxing the rich. Sure, tax the rich more because that is fair,
especially when billionaires pay lower marginal rates. But also, successful politics often means promising
to cut taxes. A primary goal for social democratic parties should be cutting regressive taxes such as VAT,
income tax or National Insurance – taxes on the working class – which rose while corporate tax,
inheritance tax, and top bands of income tax were reduced. Third, carbon taxes have continually met
overwhelming political opposition, and have not been sufficient to achieve the goal of eliminating fossil
fuels. The tax proposed by Piketty at around €100 per tonne of carbon would be a very good idea, but
ideally the tax should eliminate itself, by all but ending carbon. By contrast, bans create even more moral
clarity, and galvanise more political support.97 We must ban all coal, oil and gas as fast as technologically
possible,98 because as Piketty writes, all reserves of fossil fuels ‘would be better kept in the ground to
prevent global warming’.99 
(3) THE NATURE OF SOCIAL JUSTICE 
A third main point is that social justice must replace the ideologies persistent in economics and law. ‘Social
justice’ is a creative justice. It does not merely correct or distribute what is already there,100 but its
foundation is indeed the fundamental rights that Piketty highlights.101 In a truly just society, human
capacity expands through education, better health and sustainable prosperity. It reverses the Platonic
notion that people should never change jobs and are confined to their social class for life.102 Social justice
enables everyone to fulfil their potential. Human creativity is freed when people have voice in political and

introduction from Mat Lawrence. 
99 Piketty (2020) 654 
100 cf  Aristotle,Nicomachean Ethics, Book V, who appeared to think justice was reducible to arithmetic (for corrective or
commutative justice) or geometric equations (for distributive justice). 
101 Piketty (2020) ch 17, 697-8. Also T Piketty,Capital in the Twenty-First Century(2014) 31 and 480. cf J Rawls,A Theory of Justice
(1971) 4, ‘the principles of social justice: they provide a way of assigning rights and duties in the basic institutions of society
and they define the appropriate distribution of benefits and burdens of social co-operation.’ The Rawlsian definition does not
quite capture the importance of creating potential. 
102 cf Plato,The Republic, Book IV, Part V, 139, translated by D Lee, ‘the worst of evils’ that ‘spells destruction to our state’ is
‘interchange of jobs’. When each class ‘does its own job and minds its own business, that is justice and makes our state just.’
11economic power, and the security and material resources to plan their lives.103 Far from a ‘mirage’,104 social
justice includes an ‘economic system’ that guarantees ‘direct available opportunity’.105 If ‘justice’ at its most
basic is getting what we are due, social justice is the duty we owe to each other to create a better world, to
‘lend a helping hand’ to each other, and to improve the content of our character.106 This is the concept
behind the second to last, oft forgotten article 29 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
‘Everyone has duties to the community in which alone the free and full development of his personality is
possible.’107 When we create human development for everyone, that is justice and makes our society just. 
As Piketty writes, ‘it is wise to be wary of abstract and general principles of social justice’, because
what matters is the ‘concrete policies and institutions’.108 As the labour lawyer, Bill Wedderburn, put it that
means ‘hard legal analysis allied to an alternative social vision’.109 The social vision of the Universal
Declaration was and is the answer to fascism, the book to beat the hyper-capitalist base of the crazed,
identitarian, nativist, fossil-fueled, financialised far-right, manifested in Trump, Farage, Le Pen, the AfD,
Lega Nord, Putin, Modi, Bolsonaro, and the rest. The crowning achievement of the Universal Declaration
was showing that while personal property is a human right (not a corporate right) it is just one among
many. The other rights, which are essentially concerned with productive property,110 include ‘the right to
work’, ‘just and favourable remuneration’, ‘social security’, ‘holidays with pay’, ‘a standard of living
adequate for the health and well-being’ of everyone ‘including food, clothing, housing and medical care’,
to education, including free university, ‘the right freely to participate in the cultural life of the community,
to enjoy the arts and to share in scientific advancement and its benefits.’111 This is the ‘Magna Carta of
all’,112 the constitution of humankind, the basis of our global polity. If we are to have ideology, let it be not
one that perpetuates inequality, but one that says all ‘human beings are born free and equal in dignity and
rights.’ Let the ideal be ‘Democracy and social justice.’113 
103 e.g. T Paine,The Rights of Man (1792) Part II, ch 3, ‘There is existing in man, a mass of sense lying in a dormant state.... As it is
to the advantage of society that the whole of its faculties should be employed, the construction of government ought to be
such as to bring forward, by a quiet and regular operation, all that extent of capacity which never fails to appear in
revolutions.’ S Webb and B Webb,Industrial Democracy (9th edn 1926) Part IV, ch 4, 847-849, ‘We ourselves understand by the
words “Liberty” or “Freedom,” not any quantum of natural or inalienable rights, but such conditions of existence in the
community as do, in practice, result in the utmost possible development of faculty in the individual human being.... When the
conditions of employment are deliberately regulated so as to secure adequate food, education, and leisure to every capable
citizen, the great mass of the population will, for the first time, have any real chance of expanding in friendship and family
affection, and of satisfying the instinct for knowledge or beauty.’ 
104 cf FA Hayek,Law, Legislation and Liberty(1973) vol II, ch 9. The ‘mirage’ that Hayek tries to discredit is at the foundation of
international law, in the constitution of the International Labour Organisation: Versailles Treaty 1919part XIII, ‘peace can be
established only if it is based upon social justice’. The failure of the other parts of the Versailles Treaty illustrated this vividly.

124. CONCLUSION
If we are ‘saturated in ideology’, as Piketty writes, then economics and law are two of the main culprits.
Economics often departs from its roots, when its constructs of the ‘market’ and ‘firms’ ignore labour’s
unequal bargaining power, the ‘negligence and profusion’ of unaccountable corporations, and the need for
public  ownership  and  standards  for  essential  services.114  Law  often  departs  from  reality,  when  its
abstractions of property, contract, or corporate personhood conceal ‘the exercise of social power behind a
veil of law’.115 The task in both fields is to develop a new understanding and grammar, coherent with
history, philosophy, sociology, and anthropology, that fits the evidence and data. All successful theories
must ultimately be empirically grounded.116 Perhaps the greatest achievement of Piketty’s work could be to
bring economics firmly back to the values in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. 
114 See A Smith,The Wealth of Nations(1776) Book I, ch 8, §12 (on labour’s unequal power), Book V,ch 1, §107 (on corporate
accountability), Book V, ch 1, §121 and Part III (on which enterprises should be publicly owned or controlled). 
115 O Kahn-Freund, ‘Hugo Sinzheimer 1875–1945’ inLabour Law and Politics in the Weimar Republic (1981) 102, ‘All these
abstractions contain within them socially opposed and contradictory phenomena: property used for production and property
used for consumption, agreements between equal parties and agreements between unequal parties, capitalist and worker.
Through abstraction it is possible to extend legal rules, which are appropriate to the social phenomenon for which they were
originally developed, to other social phenomena, thereby concealing the exercise of social power behind a veil of law.’
