Taxing the New Intellectual Property Right
XUAN-THAO N. NGUYEN*  AND JEFFREY A.  MAINE**
INTRODUCTION
Imagine you are counsel for a company that would like to capitalize
on the heightened interest in popular culture surrounding a new breed of
man who is well-groomed, interested in fashion, and unafraid to express
his  emotions. He  is  the "metrosexual"-as  reported  by  the New  York
Times.' In the literary genre this man is the counterpart to Bridget Jones
from the  best-selling book, Bridget Jones' Diary. Your  CEO excitedly
informs  you  that  he  has  just  bought  the  Internet  domain  name
"men.com"  for $1.3  million at an auction;2 and the company is going to
build a Web site that will include tips on fashion and grooming, how-to
advice,  news, and literature,  all for this new breed  of man. Your CEO
then asks you, "What are the tax consequences of purchasing this domain

name?"  You realize you have no answer. Of course, you know the tax
consequences  of purchasing  traditional intellectual property assets such
as patents, copyrights, and trademarks. But you have no idea what to do
with this new type of intellectual property, especially when the name is
generic,  like "men.com."  The company could save or lose  hundreds of
thousands  of  dollars  depending  on  your  answer,  so you promise  your
CEO you  will get back  to him as soon as  you find out exactly  where
domain names fit in the current tax regime.
With the arrival  of global electronic commerce  transactions  on the
Internet,  new  forms  of  intellectual  property  rights,  such  as  Internet
domain names, have emerged. Today, Internet domain names are some
companies'  most  valuable  assets.'  Yet  law  professors,  attorneys,  and
judges struggle with the legal nature of domain names, which is far from
settled. Questions drawing recent attention include: How should domain
names be valued?'  Can domain names  be used as collateral in secured
transactions,  and  how  does  one  perfect  a  security  interest in  domain
names?5  What  will happen to domain  names  in bankruptcy? 6 Another
puzzling  question,  which  has  received  little  attention,  is  how  should
domain names be treated for federal tax purposes?  Although there are
tax rules  governing traditional intellectual property rights, there are no
rules dealing specifically with domain names. This article addresses these
parallel  questions:  Are domain  names  merely  variations  of traditional
forms of intellectual  property  and other intangible  rights to which the
existing tax regime can be applied? Or are domain names new intangible
rights that need their own set of tax laws?
Current, albeit arbitrary, rules exist governing the tax treatment of

traditional forms of intellectual property, such as patents, trade secrets,
copyrights,  trademarks,  and  trade  names.7  Under  present  law,  most
patent  creation  costs  are  deductible  when  incurred,8  whereas  patent
acquisition  costs  are  deductible  either  over  an  arbitrary  fifteen-year
period (if the patent was purchased as part of the acquisition of a trade
or business) or the useful life of the patent (if the patent was purchased
separately).'  Certain trade secret creation costs are deductible when paid
or incurred,  whereas  others  are  deductible  over  fifteen  years. Â° Trade
secret acquisition costs, however, are always deductible over fifteen years
regardless of whether  they were  acquired separately or with a trade or
business."  Copyright creation costs are immediately deductible for some
creators,  but  recoverable  over  the  copyright's  useful  life  for  other
creators.2  Copyright acquisition costs are  deductible either over fifteen
years (if the copyright was purchased as part of the acquisition of a trade
or business)  or the  useful  life  of the  copyright  (if  the  copyright  was
purchased  separately).3  The  costs  of  building  the  goodwill  in  a
trademark or trade name are deductible,'4 whereas trademark and trade
name acquisition costs must be recovered over an arbitrary fifteen-year
period.'5  Current rules  also  exist governing  the tax treatment  of other
intangible rights, such as government  licenses and service contracts, the
costs of which are usually deductible over fifteen years.6
While tax principles  exist for these traditional intellectual property
and intangible rights, specific tax rules do not exist for new intellectual
property rights, such as domain names, that are emerging with the arrival
of global  electronic commerce transactions on the Internet. This article
explores  the  proper  tax  treatment  of domain  name  registration  and
acquisition  costs.7  Part I  of  this  article  explains  the  rise  of valuable

domain names as a new intellectual property right having uncertain tax
consequences.  Part  II  analyzes  the  historical  and  current  tax  rules
governing  traditional intellectual  property  and  other  intangible rights.
Part III then examines the legal nature of domain names  to determine
whether they can readily fit within the current tax regime for intangible
rights. It also explores whether domain names should be treated for tax
purposes  as  governmental  licenses,  service  contracts,  or  intangible
property;  and, if treated  as  property,  whether  domain  names  can  be
classified within a category of intangible property covered by existing tax
principles, specifically goodwill and trademarks.
Part IV of this article concludes that domain names that function as
source  identifiers  should  be  treated  under  the  current  tax  regime
applicable to trademarks, so that costs of acquiring such domain names
should be recovered ratably over fifteen years. Generic domain names, in
contrast,  possess  "inherent"  goodwill  not  dealt  with  by  the  existing
intangible  tax regime. The disparate treatment between  domain names
functioning as source identifiers and generic domain names illustrates the
inadequacies  of  tax  law  in  dealing with  the  expansion  of  intellectual
property rights for existing intangible assets as well as the emergence of
new intellectual property rights. Part IV criticizes the ad hoc response by
administrative  tax  agencies  in  dealing  with  cyber-assets,  and  calls  for
Congress  to  revisit  the  current  tax  regime  for  intangibles.  With  the
increase of global, electronic commerce transactions on the Internet, the
nature of cyberspace will undoubtedly require new tax rules.
I.  RISE OF A NEW INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHT HAVING UNCERTAIN
TAX CONSEQUENCES
A.  RISE OF DOMAIN NAMES AS VALUABLE  CYBER-ASSETS
The explosive growth of the Internet in recent years has provided a
new  medium  for  electronic  commerce  and  communication  across
national borders. 8 This network connects  computers  around the world,

recent growth of e-commerce dramatically changed the nature and economics of global business.");

facilitates  changes  in  technology,9  and  allows  different  forms  of
commerce such as B2B,  B2 C,'  and C2C" to emerge. Despite the recent
economic  downturn  and  the  "dot.com"  bubble  bursting,  the  Internet
continues to be a critical component of daily life and commerce.3 As of
September 2003, there were at least thirty-three languages "spoken" on
the Internet,4 and 803 million people connected to the global network.5

and Commercial Matters to Deal with B2B Contracts is Long Overdue, 3 J. HIGH TECH. L. 93, 94-96

business exchanges, which are Internet-based electronic markets designed to permit businesses (but
not individual consumers) to communicate and transact business with each other through a website or
portal," may raise antitrust concerns).
21.  Business-to-consumer (B2C) commerce  is still  in the early stages of growth,  as one study
indicated, with only a quarter of online users "reporting they make purchases online and under fifteen
percent doing any of the other transactional activities. Despite all of the sound and fury, business to
consumer commercial online transactions are but in their earliest stages." STANFORD INSTITrrE FOR THE

entertainment, and commercial transactions. E.g., STANFORD  INSTITUTE FOR THE QUANTITATIVE STUDY
OF SOCIETY, supra note 21 (reporting that consumers use Internet email for communication; conduct
Internet research to obtain information about hobbies, travel, and general interest; use the Internet as
an entertainment source; and engage in commercial transactions ranging from common purchases to e-
banking).

"[b]y the year 2007, the number of Internet users is projected to be approximately 1.46 billion").HASTINGS LA W JOURNAL [Vol. 56:1
Consumers use the Internet to exchange information, communicate, and
conduct business.26 The number of online users continues to increase and
e-commerce  continues  to grow. For example, worldwide  figures  for e-
commerce  growth  indicate  that  in  2000,  Internet  sales  totaled  $657
billion.  In  2003,  just  three  years  later,  the  number jumped  to  $3.98
trillion.7 In 2004, this figure is projected to reach $6.8 trillion.28
The  arrival  and  explosive  growth  of  a  networking  medium  has
facilitated the genesis of a new form of cyber asset, the domain name. A
company  must  have  a  Web  site  and  domain  name  to  provide
information, communication, goods, or services online.  Many Internet
companies,  unlike  traditional  companies,  own  mostly  intangible  assets
such  as  business  know-how,  Web  pages,  copyrights,  databases,
trademarks, and domain names." Domain names can be the name of the

million  dollars  for  "cool.com,"  and  ten  million  dollars  for

Some Internet companies have been willing to spend a large amount
of money for a memorable, easy-to-type domain name, because the name
helps increase traffic to their Web sites.37 Internet users often search for a
company,  product,  or  service  by  typing a  domain name  address in  a
location bar or entering key words  in a search  engine.3  A  memorable
and  easy-to-type  domain  name  will attract  more  visitors  than  a  long,
complicated,  or cumbersome  domain name.  For example,  "loans.com"
received more than 3,000 visitors a day even though there were no active
licensed technology, and customer lists).

network  of Web sites.4  One way to do this is to possess a  memorable
domain name that appeals to customers much like a brand name.4" This
realization has led to speculation in domain name values in recent years.
A  notable case  showing the  effect speculation  can  have  on  a  domain
name's value is "sex.com,"  which was reportedly worth as much as $250

55. Most taxpayers prefer to fully recover costs through immediate deductions rather than spread
those costs over a number of years (i.e., amortize the costs) or recover those costs when the property is
disposed of (i.e., subtract the costs from the amount realized on a sale to determine gain realized).
Unfortunately, there are a number of overriding Code provisions that prevent the current deductibility
of otherwise allowable expenditures. Thus, what may seem to be a deductible expense under one
provision may be classified as a non-deductible  expenditure under another overriding provision. A
major overriding provision is one that disallows the immediate deduction of costs that are considered
"capital  expenditures."  See  I.R.C.  Â§ 263(a)  (2ooo) (providing  for  nondeductibility  of  capital
expenditures); see also id.  Â§ 263A(a) (2000) (requiring a taxpayer to capitalize all direct and indirect
expenditures incurred to produce certain property).November 2004]  TAXING THE NEW INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY  Ii
intangible  from that party in a  purchase  or similar transaction.",6  This
rule "merely reflects [well-established]  law requiring capitalization of the
purchase  price..,  paid  to  acquire  property  from  another."57  The
regulations  list  some  examples  of  intangible  assets  that  must  be
capitalized  if  the  intangible  is  acquired  from  another  person  in  a
purchase  transaction.  Although  domain names  are not listed,  acquired
domain names would seemingly fall within the capitalization rule.
As with the costs of purchasing a domain name, it would appear that
the registration costs to obtain a domain from a domain name registrar
could  not  be  immediately  deducted  and  would  also  have  to  be
capitalized.  Treasury  regulations  issued  in  2004  require  taxpayers  to
capitalize  amounts  paid  to another party  to create  eight categories  of
created intangibles.'  One category encompasses certain  rights obtained
from a governmental  agency.9 For example, a taxpayer must capitalize
amounts paid to agovernmental agency to obtain or renew a trademark,
trade  name, or  other similar right granted by a governmental  agency."
Even  if  domain  names  do  not  fall  within  this  or  one  of  the  other
categories,  the regulations  also require taxpayers  to capitalize amounts
paid to another party to create a "separate and distinct intangible., 6' A
separate and distinct intangible asset is defined as (I)  "a property interest
of ascertainable and measurable value in [money or] money's worth" (2)
"that is subject to protection under applicable  State, Federal or foreign
law,"  and (3)  "the possession and control of which is intrinsically capable
of being sold, transferred, or pledged. 62
If the  costs  of  registering  or  acquiring  a  domain  name  are  not
immediately deductible, but rather are capitalized, then the next issue is
whether the capitalized costs may nevertheless be eligible for deductions
56. Treas. Reg. Â§  .263(a)-4(c)(I)  (2004). The reason such acquisition  costs are not currently
deductible is that the resulting property is not consumed or used within the year, but rather persists
and generates income over a period of years. If the costs incurred to acquire such property were
deductible in full in the current year, then there would be a mismatching of income and expenses that
produced that income. Income would be understated in the year of acquisition and overstated in later
years. This problem is avoided by prohibiting the immediate deduction of capitalized acquisition costs.

II.  TAX TREATMENT OF TRADITIONAL  INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS
AND  OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS
A.  PRE-1993 TAX LAW
Prior to 1993, the tax law governing intangible assets favored certain
traditional  intellectual  property  rights  (patents  and  copyrights)  over
other traditional intellectual  property forms  (trade secrets, trademarks,
and  trade  names).  Treasury  regulations  provided  that  the  costs  of
acquiring  intangible  assets having a useful life  substantially beyond  the
taxable  year were  not currently  deductible, but rather  capitalized.6 If,
, 
however, an acquired intangible  asset could be shown to have a limited
useful  life,  then  the  capitalized  acquisition  costs  were  recoverable
(deductible)  over  that asset's  lifetime.6'  As a  corollary,  the  capitalized
cost  of  an  intangible  asset  that  had  no  definite  useful  life  was  not
63.  Just as there are no tax rules dealing with the amortization of domain name acquisition costs,
there are no tax rules governing the sale of domain names.
Because of the unique characteristics of domain names (registrant is not the owner and may
lose use for failure to pay renewal fees), it is important first to ascertain whether payments
[received] in consideration for the transfer of a domain name are for services (which cannot
qualify for capital gains treatment) or for property (which  may or may not qualify for
capital gains treatment).
MAINE & NGUYEN, supra note 7, at 4O.  Presumably, if a domain name is considered property, the next
step would be to determine whether section 1253 applies to a domain name transfer. If the transfer of
a domain name is not within the scope of section 1253, then other tax provisions, such as sections 1221,
1222, 1231, and 1245, would presumably govern the character of the gain or loss. For the likely tax
treatment of domain name sales, see MAINE &N GUYEN, supra note 7, at 4O-O8.
64. Treas. Reg. Â§ 1.263(a)-2(a) (196o). The reason such intangible asset acquisition costs are not
currently deductible is that the resulting acquired intangibles are not consumed or used within the
year, but rather persist and generate income over a period of years. If the costs incurred to acquire
such intangible assets were deductible in full in the current year, then there would be a mismatching of
income  and expenses  that produced  that  income. Income  would  be understated  in  the year of
acquisition  and overstated in later years. This  problem is avoided by prohibiting  the immediate
deduction of capitalized acquisition costs.
65. Id. Â§ I.I67(a)-3.
If an intangible asset is known from experience or other factors to be of use in the business
or in the production of income  for only  a limited period, the  length of which can  be
estimated with  reasonable accuracy, such an intangible  asset  may  be the subject of a
depreciation allowance.November 2004]  TAXING THE NEW INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY  13
recoverable  through  amortization,  but  could  only  be  recovered  upon
abandonment or disposition of the asset.66
i.  TraditionalI ntellectual Property Rights
Under this legal framework, patents and copyrights were eligible for
amortization due to the fact that they have limited useful lives (statutory
legal lives of twenty years in the case of patents and 70, 95, or 120 years
in the  case  of certain copyrights).67 Moreover,  the  capitalized  costs  of
acquiring patents and copyrights did not have to be amortized over their
long legal lives, but could be recovered  over much shorter periods. The
regulations  provided  that  the  useful  life  of  an  intangible  was  not
necessarily the statutory legal life of the asset, but rather was the period
over which  the asset  may  reasonably  be expected  to be  useful to the
taxpayer  in  his  trade  or business  or in  the  production  of  income.6  A
taxpayer  could  establish  the  useful  life  of  a  patent  or  copyright  for
amortization  purposes  based  upon  his  own  experiences  with  similar
property; if such experiences were inadequate, a taxpayer could establish
the useful life based upon general  industry standards."  Furthermore, a
taxpayer  had  to  establish  the  useful  life  only  with  "reasonable
accuracy."7   According  to  one  court,  "[e]xtreme  exactitude  in
ascertaining the duration of an asset is a paradigm that the law does not
demand. All that the law and regulations require is reasonable accuracy
in forecasting the asset's useful life."'"
In contrast  to patents  and copyrights,  other  traditional  intellectual
property rights were not eligible for amortization since they do not have
limited lives. There is no specific term of protection for trade secrets; the
protection is available as long as confidential proprietary information is
66.  Id. ("An intangible asset, the useful life of which is not limited, is not subject to the allowance
for depreciation.").
67.  Indeed, the regulations specifically  mentioned patents and copyrights as intangible assets
eligible for amortization. Id. A patent confers the right to exclude others from making, using, selling,
offering for sale, or importing the claimed invention for a certain term of years (currently twenty years
from the  date of application).  35 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 154(a)(2),  (d)  (20oo).  Ownership of a valid copyright
confers five exclusive rights for a limited time. The Copyright Act, over the years, has lengthened the
term of copyright protection. Currently, a work of authorship enjoys a term of the life of the author
and seventy years thereafter. 17 U.S.C. Â§ 302(a) (2000). For works created under the doctrine of works
made for hire, the term  is ninety-five years after first publication or 120  years after creation. Id.

kept in secrecy, which could be indefinite."  Likewise, there is no specific
term of  protection for trademarks  and trade  names; the  protection  is
available  as long as the trademark  or trade name is used in commerce
and has not been abandoned.73 Accordingly, under pre-1993 law, all trade
secret,  trademark,  and  trade  name  acquisitions  costs  had  to  be
capitalized  and  could  only  be  recovered  upon  abandonment  or
disposition of those assets.4
2.  Goodwill
The  same  was  true  for  goodwill.  Under  pre-1993  tax  law,  the
capitalized costs of acquiring goodwill were not eligible for amortization
allowances, as goodwill does not have an ascertainable limited life.75 Lest
there be any doubt, Treasury regulations clarified that "[n]o  deduction
for  depreciation  [was]  allowable  with  respect  to  goodwill.''76   The
capitalized  costs of  obtaining  goodwill  could  only  be recovered  upon
abandonment or disposition of the goodwill.
Prior to  1993,  "goodwill"  was  viewed  as  an umbrella covering  all
intangible assets of a business. This historical concept of goodwill led to
considerable  controversy  between  taxpayers  and  the Internal Revenue
Service.  While  taxpayers  attempted  to  argue  that  a  wide  variety  of
intangible assets were independent assets severable  from goodwill  (and
eligible  for  amortization  provided  they had  a limited  useful life),  the
Service  strongly held  to the  position that these  intangible  assets  were
indistinguishable  or  inseparable  from  goodwill  (and  not  eligible  for
amortization).  The  controversy over whether to characterize  intangible
assets  as  goodwill  was  eventually  settled  with  the  Supreme  Court's
72.  See UNIFORM TRADE SECRETS ACT (amended 1985), 14 U.L.A.4 33 (199O).
73.  Under federal trademark law, abandonment is presumed if nonuse of the trademark extends
for three years. 15 U.S.C.  Â§ 1127 (2000). Token uses of a trademark for the purpose of reserving
trademark rights do not prevent a finding of abandonment. Exxon Corp. v. Humble Exploration Co.,
695 F.2d 96, 99-io3 (5th Cir. 1983). In addition, abandonment of a trademark could occur if the owner
failed to police the trademark so that it becomes the generic name for the product or service with
which it is used. 15 U.S.C. Â§ I127.
74.  I.R.C. Â§ 177 (repealed 1986) permitted taxpayers to elect to amortize any trademark or trade
name expenditures over a period of five years or more.
75.  The prohibition  against  amortizing  the cost  of goodwill  first appeared  in  Treas.  Reg.
Â§ i.i67(a)-3, which stated that "[n]o deduction for depreciation is allowable with respect to good will."
This prohibition first appeared in the regulations in 1927. See Kevin R. Conzelmann, 533-2d T.M.,
Amortization of Intangibles, A-5 & A-5 n.3i (2ooi)  (citing T.D. 4055, VI-2 C.B. 63; Reg. 69, Art. 163
(Revenue Act of 1926)).

omitted).November 2004]  TAXING THE NEW INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY  15
decision in Newark Morning Ledger Co. v.  United States.77 The Supreme
Court held in that case that amortization of an intangible asset depends
on whether the asset is capable of being valued and whether the asset has
a  limited useful life. The Court rejected  the  Service's  argument that a
taxpayer must also prove that the intangible is separate and distinct from
goodwill.
3.  Governmental Rights and Contract Rights
Prior to the Supreme  Court's decision in Newark Morning Ledger,
the tax treatment of goodwill often impacted the tax treatment of other
intangible  assets, including,  for example,  service  contracts. Under pre-
1993  tax law, if  a service  contract  was a distinct and  identifiable  asset
severable from the concept of goodwill, it was amortizable if the contract
had a  useful  life. No  depreciation  deduction would  be  allowed  if the
contract  were  inseverable  from  goodwill  or  if  the  contract  had  an
indefinite useful life.
A typical case under pre-I993 law dealing with service contracts was
KFOX, Inc. v.  United States.78 In  KFOX, the buyer  of a  radio station
allocated  the  total  purchase  price  among  the  various  tangible  and
intangible  assets  obtained.  More  specifically,  the  buyer  allocated
$400,000 to disc jockey and  station manager contracts  and depreciated
that  amount  over  the  life  of  the  contracts.79  The  Service  denied  this
allocation completely, holding that these contracts were intangible assets
inseparable  from  the  concept  of  goodwill  and  as  such  were
nondeductible.8'
The  Claims  Court  first  addressed  whether  these  contracts  were
severable  from the  general  concept  of goodwill.  Relying  on  Meredith
Broadcasting Co. v.  United States,8' the  Claims  Court  concluded  that
goodwill was divisible into its identifiable parts, and that service contracts
of significant  and  identifiable  value  could  be  severed  from  goodwill,
where goodwill was defined generally.8' The Claims Court determined in
77. 507 U.S. 546 (1993). The controversy was settled by the later enactment of I.R.C. Â§ 197, which
is discussed infra Part II.A.3.
78. 51o F.2d 1365 (Ct. Cl. 1975).

8I.  405 F.2d 1214 (Ct. Cl. 1968) (concluding that where "goodwill" is used as a catch-all term for
all of a going business' intangible assets that are associated with its profitability, it is clearly divisible
into its component parts).
82.  KFOX, 51o F.2d at 1376-77.HASTINGS LAW JOURNAL [Vol. 56:1
KFOX that  the  disc jockey  and  station  manager  contracts  (i)  "had
significant and measurable value independent of their direct contribution
to the value of [the institution's] goodwill," (2)  "were necessary assets for
the  continued  profitability  of  the  [radio]  station,"  and  (3)  "provided
nothing to KFOX's institutional goodwill inasmuch as radio or television
audiences  are not loyal to a particular station so much as  an individual
star  or format.' '  Accordingly,  the  court concluded  that the  contracts
,
were independent assets severable from the radio station's goodwill and
could be treated separately for tax purposes."4
The  Claims  Court  then  addressed  whether  these  contracts,  even
though severable  from goodwill, were amortizable. As noted above, the
cost of an intangible asset which could be shown to have a limited useful
life was recoverable through an amortization allowance over that asset's
lifetime.5  It had previously been determined that, with respect to service
contracts,  the reasonable  useful life was the contract's  stated term.86 It
had also been determined that the existence of a renewal option did not
necessarily mean that the life of a contract was indefinite, 8 and that the
useful  life  of a contract  may include  renewal  options  in  some  cases.88
Accordingly,  the Claims Court in KFOX held that the disc jockey and
station manager contracts were amortizable over the contract life, which
was  measured by the  contract term plus  a single  renewal option.89 The
four disc jockey contracts were amortizable over five years  (they "were
to last two years, each with an option  of renewal by the station for an
additional  three-year  term").'  The  station  manager  contract  was
amortizable  over four years  (it was  to last two years, with a  two-year

renewal option).9' It is important to note that, in KFOX, the disc jockey
and station manager contracts  had a single renewal option. Under pre-
1993 law, if contracts for services had automatic renewal provisions, they
would  have  no  ascertainable  useful  life  and  thus  be  ineligible  for
amortization.
This same treatment applied to governmental licenses (such as FCC
television  and  radio  broadcast  licenses).  Under  pre-i993  law,
governmental licenses were generally ineligible for amortization because
such  licenses  tended  to  be  renewed  repeatedly  and  hence  had  no
determinable useful lives.92 For example, in Meredith Broadcasting Co. v.
United States, the Claims Court held that a taxpayer was not entitled to
an amortization  deduction for an FCC license  because such licenses  do
not  have  determinable  useful  lives.93  The  Claims  Court,  in  Forward
Communications Corp. v.  United States, later  held  that  FCC  radio
broadcasting licenses  were generally ineligible for amortization because
they  tend to contain  automatic  renewal  provisions  and, thus, have  no
reasonably ascertainable limited useful life.'

The  Revenue  Reconciliation  Act  of  i993  (RRA  of  i993)
dramatically  changed  the  tax  treatment  of  traditional  forms  of
intellectual property and  other intangible rights,  including goodwill, by
enacting section 197 of the Code.9'  Prior to the enactment of section  197
in 1993, as discussed above, the costs of acquiring intangible assets could
be amortized only if the intangible  assets had a useful life that could be
determined  with reasonable  accuracy. 6 This  seemingly simple  rule for
recovering the costs of intangible assets created several problems.
One problem with the historical tax regime for intangibles was that it
caused much litigation concerning the identification  of intangible assets

and their useful lives.7  No deduction for depreciation was allowable with
respect  to goodwill,"5  so taxpayers tried  to distinguish intangible  assets
from goodwill, and the Internal Revenue Service often challenged those
determinations.'  In  i99i, the  government  estimated  that the  Internal
Revenue  Service  assessed  eight  billion  dollars  in  deficiencies  against
taxpayers who attempted to amortize intangibles that the Service claimed
were  part of non-amortizable  goodwill."Â°  In 1993, it was estimated that
$14.4  billion  in  proposed  adjustments  relating  to  amortization  of
intangible assets had been made by the Service at various levels of audit
and  litigation.''  Of course, taxpayers who had  the resources  to litigate
over  the  identification,  valuation,  and  establishment  of  limited  useful
lives of intangible assets were better off than those taxpayers who lacked
resources. Needless to say, with so much litigation and uncertainty, there
was a need to simplify the tax law relating to intangibles."2
A second  problem  arose  as  commentators  questioned  the  courts'
well-established  theory that goodwill  retains its  value  indefinitely  and,
therefore,  is  nondepreciable.' 3  The  recent  activities  of  a  business
determine goodwill, "(i.e.,  the ability to generate excess earnings)"; if a
business  makes  no  effort  to  create  new  goodwill,  it  will  diminish.'"
Furthermore,  it was inequitable that taxpayers were able to depreciate
the assets  used to  create goodwill,  yet unable to depreciate  purchased
goodwill.05   However,  by  definition,  goodwill  does  not  have  an
ascertainable useful life or necessarily declines over time, so it cannot be
said to "depreciate."''

A third problem stemmed from the fact that the rule for recovering
the costs  of acquired  intangible  assets  differed  dramatically  from  the
corresponding set of rules for recovering the costs of acquired tangible
assets. In contrast to the regulatory rule governing intangible assets, the
Internal  Revenue  Code contained  a  detailed set  of arbitrary  recovery
rules  for  all  tangible  assets.  More  specifically,  the  relevant  Code
provisions  provided  arbitrary  conventions  and  methods  for recovering
costs of tangible assets and, more importantly, provided  artificially low
recovery periods (3,  5, and 7 year recovery periods) for many tangible
assets that arguably have longer useful lives."'Â°  This disparate treatment
between  intangible  and  tangible  assets  created  distortions  that  were
unfair to taxpayers.'Â°s  For example,  taxpayers who  acquired businesses
with mostly  tangible  assets  fared  better  than taxpayers  who  acquired
businesses  with  mostly  intangible  assets,  a  problem  that worsened  as
more  and  more  valuable  business  assets  took  the  form  of intangible
assets."  To mitigate these distortions,  many saw the need to reconcile
the  treatment  of  acquired  intangible  assets  with  the  treatment  of
acquired tangible assets."'
Section  197, which was enacted  in 1993  to address  these problems,
created an arbitrary fifteen-year  recovery  period for certain  intangible
assets.  Specifically,  section  197  provides  a  fifteen-year  amortization
deduction  for  the  capitalized  costs  of  an  "amortizable  section  197
intangible,"  and  prohibits  any  other  depreciation  or  amortization
deduction  with  respect  to  that  property."'  Section  197  defines  an
"amortizable  section  197  intangible"  as  any  "section  197  intangible"

of a trade or business or an activity conducted for profit."2 Section 197
provides  a  list of  intangible  assets  that  fall  within  the  definition  of
"section  197  intangible"  and  are  subject  to  fifteen-year  amortization.
Section I97 also specifically excludes certain intangible assets. If section
197 does not apply to an intangible asset (i.e.,  the asset is not listed as a
section  197  intangible  or is specifically  excluded  from  the  definition),
amortization continues to be governed by pre-section 197 law."3 Thus, an
intangible  asset that is not  covered by section  197 and  its fifteen-year
amortization will be subject to an amortization allowance only if the asset
has a limited useful  life, the duration of which can be ascertained  with
reasonable accuracy.  4
Section 197 dramatically changed the tax treatment of many forms of
intangible assets. Section 197 provided an arbitrary fifteen-year recovery
period  for many  intangible  assets that were  already  amortizable  over
their  useful  lives  under  pre-section  197  law."5  More  importantly,  it
provided  for the first time an arbitrary fifteen-year  recovery  period for
many intangible  assets that have unlimited useful lives and, as a result,
were not at all amortizable under pre-section 197 law.'6 It also left the
law as it was for several other forms of intangible assets, permitting them
to be recovered over their reasonable useful lives."I7 What was clear after
the enactment of section  197 was that the capitalized costs of creating or
acquiring traditional forms of intellectual property rights and many other
intangibles  were  deductible  over  some  recovery period  (either  fifteen
years or the asset's useful life)."8
In January  2004,  the Treasury  department  issued final  regulations
under  section  167  providing  a  fifteen-year  safe  harbor  amortization
period for certain intangible assets that do not have readily ascertainable

straight-line  method  consistent  with amortization  under section  197.20
The regulations provide that the safe harbor amortization does not apply
to  intangibles  acquired  from  another  party.'2'  The  regulations  also
provide that the safe harbor amortization does not apply if amortization
periods  are  already  prescribed  under  existing  law,'22  or if  intangibles
already have readily ascertainable useful lives on which amortization can
be based.'23 Thus, the safe harbor provision apparently governs only self-

121.  Treasury  regulation section  I.i67(a)-3(b)(i)(ii)  provides that  "a  taxpayer  may  treat  an

"A taxpayer must capitalize amounts paid to another party to acquire an intangiblef rom that party in a
purchase or  similar  transaction."  Treas.  Reg.  Â§ 1.263(a)-4(c)(1)  (20o4)  (emphasis  added).  That
regulation goes on to provide a nonexhaustive list of intangibles within the scope of the provision,
provided they are "acquired from another party in a purchase or similar transaction."  Id. Â§ 1.263(a)-

another party in a purchase or similar transaction"). For a discussion of whether only those fifteen
types of intangibles  listed in  section  1.263(a)-4(c)(i)(i)-(xv)  are  excluded  from the  safe harbor
amortization under section i.i67(a)-3(b)(i)(ii) if acquired from another party in a purchase or similar
transaction, or, instead, whether all intangibles acquired from another party are excluded from the safe
harbor amortization, see infra notes 385-391  and accompanying text.
122.  Treas. Reg. Â§ 1.167(a)-3(b)(i)(i). For example, section i67(0(i) prescribes a special thirty-six-
month  amortization  period for certain computer software, the  creation  costs of which were not
immediately deductible under Revenue Procedure 2000-50. I.R.C. Â§ 167()(i) (2oo4); Rev. Proc. 2ooo-
5o, 2000-2 C.B. 6Ol. Also, section 197 already prescribes a fifteen-year amortization period for self-
created trademarks and trade names. I.R.C. Â§ I97(a), (c), (d)(i)(F).
123.  Treas. Reg. Â§ i.i67(a)-3(b)(1)(iii). Self-created patents, for example, have  an ascertainable
useful life since the term of a patent extends for twenty years from the date a patent application is
filed.  Likewise,  self-created  copyrights have  determinable  useful lives;  in  the case  of  works of
authorship, the term of a copyright extends for the life of the author and seventy years thereafter; for
works created under the doctrine of works made for hire, the term is ninety-five years after publication
or 120 years after creation. Accordingly, the safe harbor amortization does not apply to otherwise
capitalized costs of creating patents and copyrights. To the extent the costs of creating patents and
copyrights are not currently deductible under the Code, (see I.R.C. sections 162 (permitting deduction
for ordinary and necessary business expenses) and 174 (permitting current deduction for research and
experimental  expenditures)), such costs may be recovered over their useful lives under existing law.

have  determinable  useful  lives.  Consequently,  an  acquired  intangible
asset  that  is  not  governed  by  section  197  and  does  not  have  a
determinable useful life would not be amortizable at all. 4
The following discussion applies  current tax law to the traditional
forms  of  intellectual  property  (patents,  trade  secrets,  copyrights,
trademarks,  and  trade  names),  as  well  as  to  goodwill,  governmental
rights, and contract rights.
i.  TraditionalI ntellectual Property Rights
Subject  to  important  exceptions  noted  below,  a  "section  197
intangible"  generally  includes  any patent, copyright,  formula, process,
design, pattern, know-how,  format, package design, computer  software,
or interest in a  film, sound recording, videotape, book, or other similar
property.'25 A "section  197 intangible"  also  includes  any trademark  or
trade name.'26A  trademark includes any word, name, symbol, device, or
any combination thereof, adopted and used to identify goods or services
and  distinguish them  from those  provided  by  others.27 A trade  name
includes  any  name used  to  identify  or designate  a  particular  trade or
business or the name or title used by a person or organization engaged in
a trade or business12 A trademark or trade name includes any trademark
or trade name arising under statute or applicable common law, and any
similar right obtained by contract. 9 The renewal of a trademark or trade
name is treated as an acquisition of the trademark or trade name.'30
Although  the  definition of "section  i97 intangible"  appears  broad
enough to encompass nearly all forms of intellectual property, there are
several important exceptions. First, most self-created forms of intellectual
property  are  specifically  excluded  from  the  definition  of  section  197
intangibles.'3' The regulations define a "self-created  intangible asset"  as
an  "intangible  created  by  a  taxpayer  to  the extent  that  the  taxpayer

makes payments  or otherwise  incurs costs  for its creation,  production,
development, or improvement, whether the actual work is performed by
the taxpayer  or by another  person  under a contract with the  taxpayer
entered into before the contracted creation, production, development, or
improvement."'32 There  is one important exception  to the exclusion  for
self-created  intangibles.  Section  197  does  apply  to  self-created
trademarks and trade names.'33 As a result, taxpayers may amortize over
fifteen  years  the  capitalized  costs  incurred  in  connection  with  the
development or registration of a trademark or trade  name.134 All  other
intellectual  property  creation  costs  that must otherwise  be  capitalized
(i.e.,  nondeductible  costs incurred in  developing  patents,  trade  secrets
and know how, and copyrightable works) are not eligible for the fifteen-
year amortization treatment of section I97.31
Other  exceptions  in  section  197  pertain  to  certain  purchased
intangibles. More specifically, several exceptions in section  197 apply to
intellectual  property that is  not acquired  in a  transaction  (or series of
related  transactions)  involving  the  acquisition  of  assets  constituting  a
trade or business or substantial portion thereof.'  For example, the term
"section  197  intangible"  does  not  include  any  interest  (including  an
132.  Treas. Reg.  Â§ 1.197-2(d)(2)(i)-(ii).  Thus,  even a process or know-how  that is developed
specifically for a taxpayer under an arrangement with another person or organization pursuant to
which the taxpayer retains all rights to the process or know-how is to be considered created by the
taxpayer. See H.R. REP. No. 103-213, at 672, 684 (1993),  reprinted in 1993 U.S.C.C.A.N. lO88, 1361,

development or registration of a trademark or trade name are to be amortized over the [fifteen year]
period." H.R. CONF. REP. No. 103-213, at 684 (1993),  reprinted in 1993 U.S.C.C.A.N.  io88, 1373. The
law is not clear, however, when a taxpayer must begin amortizing such costs. It should be noted that
there are certain expenses associated  with trademarks that are not required to be capitalized and
amortized over fifteen years. There is some recent authority suggesting that advertising expenditures
and costs incurred to create package designs may be deducted in full in the year paid or incurred. In
Revenue  Ruling  92-80,  the  IRS  ruled  that  advertising  expenditures  are  currently  deductible
notwithstanding  the fact that they often produce  benefits  that give rise to distinctive intellectual
property assets such as trade dress, trademarks, and trade names. Rev. Rul. 92-80, 1992-2 C.B. 57.
Revenue Ruling 92-80 was recently applied by the Tax Court in a trade dress development case. See
RJR Nabisco, Inc. v. Conm'r, 76 T.C.M. (CCH) 71 (1998)  (holding that advertising campaign  and
execution expenditures were  currently deductible  even though they provided long-term  benefits-
statutory rights and common-law trademark rights that attach to "trade dress"). More recently, the
Treasury department issued final regulations clarifying that the costs of creating a package design are
currently deductible and do not have to capitalized. Treas. Reg. Â§ I.263(a)- (b)( )(v) (2004).

"section  197 intangible"  also does not include any interest (including an
interest as  a licensee)  in  a film,  sound recording, videotape,  book,  or
other similar property if the interest is not acquired as part of a purchase
of a trade or business.': Trade secrets, know-how, trademarks, and trade
names  are  not  included  within  the  exception  for  separately  acquired

acquired as part of a trade or business or separately.
Whether  the  exception  for  separately  acquired  patents  and

5o% of the capital  or profit interest in  the partnership.  I.R.C. Â§ 267(b)(I)-(3), (O),  (c)(4).  The

This determination is not always easy. For purposes of section  197,  an
asset or group  of assets  constitutes a trade or business or a substantial
portion thereof if (i)  the use of such assets would constitute  an active
trade  or business  under section  355,40  or (2)  its  character is such that
goodwill or going concern value could under any circumstances attach to
such group.4' In determining  whether goodwill or going  concern value

may be treated as the acquisition of a trade or business or a substantial
portion  thereof.4'3  In  such  a  case,  the  intellectual  property  would  be

140.  Treas. Reg.  Â§ t.io6o-i(b)(2)(A)  (as  amended  in 2003).  Section 355  deals  with corporate
divisions, such as spin-offs, split-offs, and split-ups. Under section 355, a corporate division will be
eligible for nonrecognition treatment only if it meets several statutory and nonstatutory requirements.
One requirement for nonrecognition treatment is that both  the distributing corporation  and the
controlled corporation must be engaged immediately after the distribution in the active conduct of a
trade or business. I.R.C. Â§ 355(a)(I)(C), (b). The statutory definition of an "active trade or business"
requires that the corporation's trade or business have been "actively conducted throughout the 5-year
period ending on the date of the distribution." Id. Â§ 355(b)(2)(B). Whether a trade or business is
"actively"  as opposed to "passively"  engaged in a trade or business depends  upon the facts and
circumstances. The regulations provide that a trade or business is required to perform active and
substantial management and operational functions. The active conduct of a trade or business does not
include the holding of intellectual property for investment purposes or the ownership and operation
(including  licensing) of real  or personal property used in a trade  or business,  unless the owner

additional value that attaches to property because of its existence as an integral part of an

of a trade or business (or a part of a trade or business) to continue functioning or generating

value could attach under any circumstance). One might envision, for example, a situation where the
acquisition of a patent or copyright could be an acquisition of a trade or business or, more easily, a
substantial portion thereof, especially if such acquisition included ancillary rights and trademarks.HASTINGS LAW JOURNAL [Vol. 56:1
As discussed above, the costs of creating many forms of intellectual
property and the costs of separately acquiring patents and copyrights are
not subject  to fifteen-year  amortization under section  197.  It should be
remembered, however, that if section 197 does not apply, such costs may
nevertheless  be  recovered  over  the  useful  life  of  the  property  under
section i67 (or any relevant administrative pronouncement) provided the
property has an ascertainable  useful life. Such recovery period  may or
may  not be longer  than the  prescribed fifteen-year  recovery period  of
section 197.
2.  Goodwill
As  outlined above,  section  197  now  governs the  tax  treatment  of
many  traditional  intellectual  property  rights,  providing  an  arbitrary
fifteen-year  recovery period  for rights  that, under pre-section  197 law,
were  either  not  amortizable  or  were  amortizable  over  a  period
prescribed by other provisions of the Code or regulations. In a dramatic
shift  in  tax policy,  section  197  was also  structured  to  govern  the  tax
treatment of goodwill.'"  The term "section  197 intangible" is defined as
including goodwill, which is "the value of a trade or business attributable
to  the  expectancy  of  continued  customer  patronage."'45  Accordingly,
under current law, a taxpayer can amortize the cost of acquiring goodwill
ratably over a  fifteen-year period irrespective of the fact that goodwill
does not have a limited useful life. 64
Before  the  enactment  of  section  197,  the  capitalized  costs  of
acquiring  goodwill  were  not eligible  for amortization  allowances,  and
could  only  be  recovered  upon  abandonment  or  disposition  of  the
144. I.R.C. Â§ 197(d)(I)(A)-(B).
145. Treas. Reg. Â§ I.197-2(b)(i). The term section  197 intangible also includes "going concern
value," which is defined in section 197 as "the additional value that attaches to property by reason of
its existence as an integral part of an ongoing business." Id. Â§ LI197-2(b)(2). Going concern value also
includes the value attributable to the ability of a trade or business to continue to generate income
without interruption despite a change in ownership, and the value attributable to the use or availability
of a trade or business (e.g., the net earnings  that would not have been received had the acquired
business not been available or operational). Id. As noted by one commentator, the significance of
these definitions are "somewhat diminished by the Supreme Court's decision in Newark and by the
enactment of Â§ 197, which is designed to reduce the tax consequences of whether an intangible asset is
or is not part of goodwill." Conzelmann, supra note 75, at A-5. For a discussion of Newark, see supra
note 77 and accompanying text.
146. In contrast to the capitalized costs of purchasing goodwill (which must now be recovered over
fifteen years under section 197), expenses to generate (create) goodwill are generally deductible when
paid or incurred. See supra note 134, for a discussion of the deductibility of goodwill advertising costs.November 2004]  TAXING THE NEW INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY  27
goodwill. 47 Many commentators had argued that denying amortization of
goodwill "did not reflect economic reality," in that goodwill is a wasting
asset that will disappear unless continually maintained.14  Commentators
also pointed out that denial of amortization of goodwill for tax purposes
was  not in  conformity  with the  treatment  of goodwill  for  accounting
purposes,  because  generally  acceptable  accounting  principles  required
amortization  of  goodwill.'49  Moreover,  the  denial  of  amortization  of
goodwill for tax purposes in the United States was inconsistent with the
treatment  of goodwill  in important  foreign  trading countries,  such  as
Belgium,  Canada, Germany, Greece, Italy, Japan, Korea, Luxembourg,
the Netherlands, Sweden, and Switzerland.'5Â°
3.  Governmental Rights and Contract Rights
Subject  to  important  exceptions  noted  below,  rights  granted  by
governmental  agencies,  as  well  as  contract  rights,  are  section  197
intangibles amortizable over fifteen years. With respect to governmental
rights,  the  term  "section  197  intangible"  is  defined  as  including  "any
license,  permit,  or  other  right  granted  by  a governmental  unit  or an
agency  or instrumentality  thereof,"  even  if the  right is  granted  for an
indefinite  period  or  is  reasonably  expected  to  be  renewed  for  an
indefinite period.''  With respect to contract rights, the term "section  197
intangible" includes customer-based and supplier-based intangible assets,
the latter being defined as "any value resulting from future acquisition of
goods or services pursuant to relationships (contractual or otherwise) in
the ordinary course of business with suppliers of goods or services to be
used or sold by the taxpayer.''52 The term "section  197 intangible" also

providing  for  the  use  of  property  that  would  be  a  section  197
intangible."5'
Certain governmental  licenses  (rights  granted  by  a  governmental
unit)  and  service  contracts  (rights  acquired  under  a  contract)  are
specifically  excluded  from  the  definition.  First,  the term  "section  I97
intangible"  does  not  include  any  right  to  receive  tangible  goods  or
services under a contract or from a governmental unit if the right is not
acquired  as part  of a purchase  of a trade  or business.I54  The  apparent
rationale  for this exception is that "the acquisition of such rights under
these  circumstances  does  not  involve  the  allocation  of purchase  price
issues that arise when a trade or business is acquired and the term of such
rights is frequently provided in the agreements involved."'55  Second, the
term "section  197 intangible" does not include any separately acquired
right under a contract or granted by a governmental unit if the right has a
fixed duration of less than fifteen  years. 5  The regulations provide that
the duration of a right under a  contract or granted  by a governmental
unit includes any renewal period if, based on the facts and circumstances
in existence  at any time during the year in which the right is acquired,
there is a reasonable expectancy of renewal.'57
If section 197 does not apply to separately acquired rights to receive
services, amortization  is governed under section  167. Regulations under
section  167 provide rules for the treatment of intangible rights that are

section  197 intangibles, those that cannot be acquired separately, are specifically  omitted from  the
exclusion for rights of fixed duration. See id. Â§ I.1 -2(c)(I3)(i)(B) (excluding goodwill, going concern
97
value,  information  base,  covenants  not  to  compete,  customer-based  intangibles,  franchises,
trademarks, and trade names). Supplier-based  intangibles are not specifically excluded, most likely
due to the fact that such intangibles can be acquired separately. Hence, the exception for rights of
fixed duration should be available to separately acquired supplier-based intangibles.
157.  Treas.  Reg.  Â§ i.i67(a)-i4(c)(3)(i)  (as  amended  in  2003).  The  regulations  also  provide,
however, that the mere fact that a taxpayer will have the opportunity to renew a contract right or other
right on the same terms as are available to others (e.g., in a competitive auction or similar process that
is designed to reflect fair market value and in which the taxpayer is not contractually advantaged) will
generally not be taken into account in determining the duration of such right provided that the bidding
produces a fair market value price comparable to the price that would be obtained if the rights were
purchased immediately after renewal from a person in an arm's length transaction. Id. Â§ i.i67(a)-
14(c)(3)(ii).November 2004]  TAXING THE NEW INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY  29
excluded from section 197.158 They provide that the cost of a  separately
acquired  right to receive  services over a  fixed, nonrenewable  period is
amortized ratably over the period of the right.'59 If the service contract is
renewable, the regulations require amortization of the cost of the service
contract  over a  period  that includes the renewal  option  periods if the
facts and circumstances in existence at any time during the taxable year
in  which  the  right  is  acquired  indicate  that  there  is  a  reasonable
expectancy of renewal.'6Â°
In sum, fifteen-year  amortization is provided under section 197 for
certain  governmental  rights  and  service  contracts  acquired  in  a
transaction  that  amounts  to  the  purchase  of  a  trade  or  business.
However, no fifteen-year amortization  is permitted under section  197 if
such rights  are purchased in a  transaction that does not amount to the
purchase  of a business. In the latter case, amortization  is allowed under
pre-section  197 law over the entire contract  term including all renewal
options.  Unfortunately, many separately  acquired service  contracts can
be  renewed  annually  for an indefinite  period for a nominal  fee, thus
precluding any amortization.
III.  TAXING DOMAIN  NAMES AS THE NEW INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
RIGHTS
As  has  been  illustrated,  tax  rules  exist  governing  traditional
intellectual  property  and  intangible  rights.  Tax  rules  do  not  exist,
however,  for  new  intangible  rights,  such  as  domain  names,  that  are
emerging with the arrival of global electronic commerce transactions on
the Internet. Although the legal nature of domain names is still unsettled,
many tax advisors are looking to current tax principles governing familiar
intangible  rights  for  guidance.  For  example,  many  tax  advisors
recommend  treating  domain  names  like  trademarks.  But  is  this
appropriate considering domain names have unique characteristics?
This section explores the legal nature of domain names to determine
whether they are merely variations of existing intellectual property and
158.  See id.  Â§ I.I67(a)-14(c)(I)  (providing amortization  rules for separately  acquired  rights to
received services that are excluded from the definition of a section 197 intangible asset under section
i97(e)(4)(B)); see also id.  Â§ I.i67(a)-s4(c)(2)  (providing amortization rules for separately acquired
rights of fixed duration that are excluded from the definition of a section 197 intangible asset under
section I97(e)(4)(D)).

intangible rights to which existing tax law can readily be applied. Part A
of  this  section  explores  whether  domain  names  should  be  viewed  as
governmental licenses for tax purposes. Part B analyzes whether domain
names  should  be  treated  as  "contracts  for  services"  represented  by
domain  name  registrations  that  are  performed  by  registrars.  Part  C
explores whether domain names should be treated as valuable intangible
property  and, if so,  addresses  whether  such property  can  be classified
within a category of intellectual property and intangible rights covered
by existing tax principles (i.e., goodwill and trademarks).
A.  DOMAIN NAMES AS GOVERNMENT LICENSES
Any "license, permit, or other right granted by a governmental  unit
or an agency or instrumentality  thereof" is a section 197 intangible. 6, If
the domain name system were viewed as a form of government licensing,
then domain names would seemingly fall within the scope of section 197
and be amortizable over fifteen years.
Domain  names  should  not be considered  government  licenses  for
purposes of section  197.I6' An examination of the history of the Internet
and the domain name assigning system ("DNS") reveals that the Internet
was the outgrowth of ARPANET, a military program that was designed
to enable  computers operated  by  the military, defense  contractors,  and
universities to communicate with one  another without the fear of being
interrupted  by  war.63  ARPANET  provided  an  example  for  future
development of a civilian network that links host computers globally and
enables users to communicate and access vast amounts of information164

In  1993,  the government  decided to  open the  Internet to  non-military
use,  including  commerce,  and  left  the  future  of  Internet  growth and
infrastructure to the private sector.165
The government relinquished direct control over development of the
Internet.'  Indeed,  the  government  permitted  Network  Solutions,  Inc.
("NSI"),  a  private  corporation,  to  commence  the  task  of  assigning
domain names in  the  ".com,". ".org,"  ".net,"  and  ".edu"  TLDs.'67 NSI
obtained an exclusive status as domain name registrar via a competitive
bidding process with the National Science Foundation.168 The agreement
that NSI reached with the National Science Foundation was not a license.
It was merely an understanding that NSI would conduct the registration
of domain names in certain TLDs.'69
In  1998,  the government,  through  the Department  of Commerce,
issued a  new policy that ended  NSI's exclusive  status  and  opened  the
domain  name  registration  system  to  other  registrars,  allowing  more
international involvement in the management  of the DNS.7' The policy

Under the new policy, the domain name registration system became
competitive because NSI was no longer the exclusive registrar of domain

registration services. See Froomkin and Lemley, supra note 46, at 26-27 (stating that ICANN opened
up registration services to new registrars who wished to compete with NSI); see also Lockheed Martin
Corp. v. Network Solutions, Inc., 194 F.3d 980, 982 (9th Cir. 1999) (noting that for a long time "NSI
was the sole ...  contractor in charge of registering domain-name  combinations for the top-level
domains," but that "NSI is no longer the exclusive registrar," as "a new competitive scheme has been

a government  agency though it has the  power to set standards and make policy with  which all
registrars must comply. See generally Stefan Bechtold,  Governance in Namespaces, 36 Lov L.A. L.

is  not  a  government  agency,  or  a  state  or  federal  actor,'77  and  an
agreement  to  perform  registration  services  is  not  a  "quintessential"
government service agreement.  78
Under  ICANN  policy,  a  registrar  only  provides  services  "in
connection  with  a  TLD  when  it  has  an  agreement  with  the  TLD's
'Registry  Operator,"'  and  the  services  include  "contracting  with
Registered  Name  Holders,  collecting  registration  data  about  the
Registered Name Holders,  and submitting  registration  information  for
entry in the Registry Database." '79 These services cease if a domain name
registrant fails to renew its registration. When a registration expires, the
domain  name becomes  available for others  to register.'8  Some domain
names due to expire are very valuable.'"'  There is a lucrative market for
the identification  and  registration  of domain  names  that have expired
and are not yet renewed.' â¢
By simply providing services, not domain name rights, registrars do

B.  DOMAIN NAMES AS CONTRACTS FOR SERVICES
Some commentators have suggested that, for tax purposes, a domain
name  represents  a contract for services,  rather than property, because
the  rights in  a  domain name  are closely  intertwined with the  services
performed  by  the  domain  name  registrar.'95  This  argument  primarily
relies  on  Network Solutions, Inc. v.  Umbro International,I nc., a  case
involving the garnishment of a domain name. In that case, the Virginia
Supreme Court held that a domain name was not subject to a seizure and
court-ordered  sale  under  Virginia's  garnishment  statute  because  the
domain name was merely a  contract for services. 96 Although there was
no federal tax issue involved in the case, a state law characterization  of
property rights is usually binding for federal tax purposes.'" Accordingly,
the  argument  goes,  federal  tax  rules  governing  service  contracts,  as
opposed  to  those  governing  intellectual  property,  should  apply  to
Internet  domain names-at  least those domain name  registrations  that
are performed by registrars located in Virginia.'98
the payment of the prescribed fee, issue to such assignee a new certificate of registration of
the said mark in the name of such assignee, and for the unexpired part of the original
period.

197.  The Supreme Court has established the respective roles for state law and federal law under
the Code:  "State  law creates legal interests and rights. The  federal revenue acts designate  what
interests or rights so created shall be taxed." See Morgan v. Comm'r, 309 U.S. 78, 8o (1940); see also
Paul L. Caron, The Role of State Court Decisions in Federal Tax Litigation: Bosch, Erie, and Beyond,

198.  One commentator has warned that the IRS could take the position that the Network Solutions
decision "is binding for all domain name purchases, even if the purchaser is not located in Virginia,HASTINGS LAW JOURNAL [VOL. 56:1
As  discussed  above,  section  197  intangibles  include  contracts  for
services,  including  any  value  resulting  from  the  future  acquisition  of
services pursuant to contractual relationships with suppliers of services."
If domain names were classified for federal tax purposes as "contracts for
services"  performed  by domain name  registrars,  then  their federal  tax
treatment would depend on whether they were acquired in a transaction
that amounts to the purchase of a trade or business. More specifically, if
a  domain  name  were  acquired  as  part of the  purchase  of  a  trade  or
business, then its acquisition costs would be amortized over an arbitrary
fifteen-year period under section 197.0 If, however, a domain name were
acquired separately, its acquisition costs would not be amortizable at all.
This is because the cost of a separately acquired service contract that is
renewable  must be  amortized  over  a  period  that  includes  all renewal
options if the facts and circumstances indicate that there is a reasonable
expectancy of renewal."'  Domain names can be renewed periodically for
an  indefinite  period  for  a  nominal  fee,  in  effect  precluding  any
amortization allowance.2
Strong arguments  exist for not classifying domain names as service
contracts for federal tax purposes. First, such a classification would treat
separately  purchased  domain  names  differently  from  other separately
purchased  intangible  rights.  For  example,  separately  acquired
trademarks  or  trade  names  are  not  excluded  from  section  197
amortization, and hence are amortizable over fifteen years. Accordingly,
if a taxpayer were  to purchase from Pepsi Company only its trademark
"Pepsi"  and no other assets, the taxpayer would be able to amortize the
total cost of purchase over fifteen years under section 197  even though
the trademark  has no limited life. On  the other  hand, if the  taxpayer
were to purchase only the domain name "pepsi.com" and no other assets,
the  taxpayer  would  not  be  permitted  any  amortization  allowance,
assuming domain names were treated as contracts for services performed
by  domain  name  registrars.  The  reason,  as  explained  above,  is  that
since the  'contract  for services'  represented  by the domain  name registration are  performed by
Network Solutions in Virginia." Kirsner, supra note 195.

separately acquired service contracts  are specifically  excluded from the
scope of section  197 and are not amortizable under section 167 since they
often  have  renewal  options  and,  hence,  unlimited  lives.  No  apparent
policy  reason  exists  for treating a  separately  purchased  trademark  or
trade  name  differently  from  a separately  acquired  domain  name  that
functions as a trademark just because a domain name might be viewed
under state law as a "contract for services" represented by domain name
registrations that are performed by registrars."3
A related  problem that would  undoubtedly  arise if domain  names
were viewed as contracts for services is that purchasers of domain names
would likely take creative steps to ensure that section 197 amortization
would be available. Again,  contracts for services are not amortizable if
purchased  in a  transaction  that does  not amount to  the purchase  of  a
trade or business. One commentator has suggested that if other assets are
purchased  from  the  seller  of the  domain  name,  the "no  amortization
rule" might not be applicable: "For example, if the seller of the domain
name also enters into an agreement not to compete with the purchaser,
then the purchaser could  take the position that there were  other assets
purchased,  and  that  amortization  should  be  allowed  over  the  usual
fifteen[-year] term."2"4
Even  if domain name  purchasers  did  not engage  in such  creative
transactional planning, they might argue that the acquisition of a single
domain name should be treated as the acquisition of a trade or business.
Under section  197, the acquisition of a single asset may be treated as the
acquisition  of a trade  or business or a substantial portion thereof if the
asset  is of such a character  that goodwill or going concern value could
attach under any circumstance.0"  In that case, the asset is removed from
the  exception  for intangibles  purchased  separately, thus  requiring  the
application  of section  197. The section  197 regulations also provide that
the acquisition of a trademark or trade name constitutes the acquisition
203.  Patents  and  separately  acquired  copyrights  are  specifically  excluded  from  section  197
amortization but are nevertheless eligible for amortization under section 167. Treas. Reg. Â§ i.i67(a)-s4
(providing rules for the amortization of certain assets not covered by section 197, such as separately
acquired patents and copyrights). Is there any compelling reason for treating a separately acquired
patent (e.g., Pepsi's patent on one of its soda products) differently from a separately acquired domain
name (Pepsi's domain name, "pepsi.com")?

of  a trade  or  business.2"  One  can  envision the  purchaser  of a  single
contract for services  (represented by a domain name registration  that is
performed  by  a  registrar)  making  the  argument  that  the  acquisition
should be deemed the  acquisition of a trade or business  or, even more
easily, a substantial portion thereof, if the acquisition included ancillary
rights.  Classifying  domain  names  as  service  contracts  for  federal  tax
purposes  would create  much litigation and uncertainty,  with the result
that those taxpayers who had the resources to hire creative  tax planners
and  to litigate  government  challenges  would  be better  off than  those
taxpayers who lacked similar resources.
Perhaps  the  best  argument  for  not  classifying  domain  names  as
service  contracts  for  federal  tax  purposes  can  be found  by  carefully
considering  the  character  of  domain  names  and  the  registration
agreement between  the registrar and registrant. Typically,  an individual
or  an entity  that wants  to establish  its presence  on  the  Internet must
obtain a domain name registration in a particular TLD. Â° If someone else
has  already  registered  the  domain  name  in  a  particular  TLD,  the
individual or entity can either attempt to register the same domain name
in a different TLD Â°8 or select a different domain name for registration in
the  same TLD.QÂ°  Registering  a domain name  is  a simple process  that

domain name for an individual end user, the registrar sends to the registry the ADD command as well
as  the information the  registry needs to populate its  database, namely the domain name, the IP
addresses of the local name servers for that domain name, the registrar, and the expiration date for the
registration. The registry, in turn, either enters this information into the central Registry Database and
the TLD zone file, or returns an error message if, for example, the domain name is already registered.

addition, the contract provides that "Register.com cannot guarantee that [an applicant] will be able to

contract  with  the  registrar,  the  registrant  enjoys  a  presence  on  the

registrar and registrant determines the parties' responsibilities,219  not the
character or classification of the domain name itself.2
Indeed,  a district  court recently found  that domain names  are not
service contracts.21  A contract between a registrar and a registrant does
not in itself give  rise to the right to use a  domain name.2  Rather, the
right  to  use  domain  names  "exists  separate  and  apart  from  [the

Schmidheiny v. Weber, 285 F. SUpp. 2d 613, 628 (E.D. Pa. 2003) (finding that the defendant registered
domain names that had lapsed for the purpose of buying and selling domain names for profit). The
defendant  registered the  name "Schmidheiny"  and solicited Mr. Schmidheiny, who  is among the
world's wealthiest individuals according to Forbes, to pay one million dollars for the domain name. Id.
at 618. The court held that the defendant violated the Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act by
registering a domain name, to which defendant had no right, with the bad faith intent solely to profit
from the name. Id. at 627-28.

property.225
C.  DOMAIN NAMES AS PROPERTY
Domain  names  are  intangible  property,  and  are  subject  to
conversion. The Ninth Circuit, in Kremen v. Cohen, held this to be true.226
In Kremen, the  plaintiff alleged  that the defendant  had  converted  the
domain name "sex.com. '227  In reversing the lower court's  decision,  the
Ninth Circuit first noted that property is a broad concept  that includes
"every  intangible  benefit  and  prerogative  that  is  susceptible  to
dispossession  or disposition.'228 The court  applied  a three-part  test  to
determine  whether  a property  right  exists  in  a domain name.  First, a
domain name must be an interest capable of precise definition.229 Second,
the owner of a domain name must be able to have -'exclusive possession
or control."2"3  Third, the putative owner of a domain name "must have
established a legitimate claim to exclusivity. 23I The court concluded that
domain names  satisfy all three  criteria.32 Indeed,  a  domain name  is a
well-defined  interest; a person who registers a  domain name  generally
decides  where  on  the  Internet  "those  who  invoke  that  particular
name ...  are sent."2'33 The court noted that ownership of a domain name
is exclusive; the registrant alone decides where to send those who visit its
Web site.34 Also, domain  names have been valued  and sold, often for
225.  See Kremen v. Cohen, 337 F.3d 1024, 1029 (9th Cir. 2003)  (stating that Network Solutions all
but conceded that registrants have property rights in their domain names); Network Solutions, Inc. v.
Clue Computing, Inc., 946 F. Supp. 858, 860 (D. Colo. 1996) (stating that Network Solution admits that
domain names are intangible personal property); Network Solutions, Inc. v. Umbro Int'l, Inc., 529 S.E.

Classifying domain names as valuable intangible "property" does not
ipso facto  determine  their  federal  tax  treatment.  Section  197,  the
necessary starting point for determining  the tax treatment  of intangible
rights,  does  not  govern  all  valuable  rights  classified  as  intangible
property,  but  instead  governs  only  those  intangible  rights  within  the
definition  of  "section  197  intangibles., 247  The  discussion  that  follows
analyzes whether  domain names fit within two particular  categories  of
section 197 intangibles: goodwill and trademarks.
i.  Domain Names as Goodwill
It could be argued that a domain name purchase should be treated as
a goodwill purchase,  amortizable  over fifteen years  under section  197.
Purchasing  a  domain name, as  the argument  might go,  is the same  as
purchasing  a company with a recognized name at a premium to its true
8
asset value.4
Acquired goodwill is included within the definition of a section  i97
intangible  asset.249  The  regulations  define  goodwill  for  purposes  of
section  197  as  "the  value  of  a  trade  or  business  attributable  to  the
expectancy of continued customer patronage...  [that] may be due to the
name  or  reputation  of  a  trade  or  business  or  any  other  factor."2"5
246.  See generally Caesars World, Inc. v. Caesars-Palace.com, I12 F. Supp. 2d 502 (E.D. Va. 2000);
Lucent Techs., Inc. v. Lucentsucks.com, 95 F. Supp. 2d 528, 535 (E.D. Va. 2000). The courts held that
there is no violation of the Constitution as  Congress has the authority  to treat a domain name
registration  as property subject to in rem jurisdiction. See Caesars World, 112 F. Supp. 2d at 504;
Lucent Techs., 95 F. Supp. 2d at 535.

248.  For the tax definition of "goodwill," see infra notes 249-254.
249. Id. Â§ i97(d)(i)(A). Acquired "going concern  value" is also included in the definition of a
section i97 intangible. The regulations under section 197 define going concern value as:
the additional value that attaches to property by reason of its existence as an integral part of
an ongoing business activity. Going concern value includes the value attributable  to the
ability of a trade or business (or a part of a trade or business) to continue functioning or
generating income without interruption notwithstanding a change in ownership ....  [Going
concern  value]  also  includes  the  value  that is  attributable  to  the  immediate  use  or
availability of an acquired trade or business, such as, for example, the use of the revenues or
net earnings that otherwise would not be received during any period if the acquired trade or
business were not available or operational.

the owner has developed  a Web site associated with its domain name.25
Internet users search for companies, products, and  services by applying
two  common  search methods.  Internet  users can  type  a domain name
directly into a Web  browser,5'9 or they can type  a domain name into a
search engine that conducts  a search  and provides users with choices of
Web sites they may want to visit.2Â° The domain name serves as the link
â¢ 26,
between  the owner and users  of a  Web site.  In addition, the domain
name  serves  as  an  important  signal  used  to  locate  resources  on  the
Internet.62
Bank  of  America,  for  example,  purchased  the  domain  name
"loans.com" for three million dollars because the location received three
to four thousand  hits per day,  even though  the domain  name was  not
associated  with  a  developed  Web  site."  Users  looking  for  lending

(concluding  that a domain name is "simply  a routing instruction  that helps computers find each
other"). The  actual  networking,  however,  is done  through  the  Internet  Protocol  numbers  that
correspond with domain names for the ease of human users. See id. ("[Tihere does not appear to be a
requirement that a computer user wishing to establish an Internet site have a domain name at all. This
is because domain names serve the sole purpose of making it easier for users to navigate the Internet;
the real networking is done through the IP numbers.").
26o.  If a Web user does not know the domain name, the user may then use an Internet search
engine. "When a keyword is entered, the search engine processes it to generate a (sometimes long) list
of web pages (ideally relating to the entered keyword)." Interactive Prods., 326 F.3d at 691.
261.  This linkage is severed if there is a third party who registered a misspelled version of the
domain name. See Ballistic Prods., Inc. v. Precision Reloading, Inc., No. Civ. 03-295o ADM/AJB, 2003

same reason, a number of other memorable domain names command  a
high price on the secondary market.z66
Clearly  these memorable,  generic  domain  names  possess inherent
value based on the number of visitors they attract,267 even though no Web
site has been constructed, no business has been created, and no products
or  services have  been offered.268 The inherent value in  domain names,
however, is not identical to the general concept of "goodwill"; that is, a
company's "expectation of continued patronage," which requires that the
company continue in existence, offering goods or services and building a
reputation.2
The concept of "goodwill"  is more akin to the value that a domain
name  accumulates  after  a  company  constructs  and  maintains  an
"loans.com," an undeveloped domain name).

traffic generated by a website-the number of people who visit the website and view the content
provided there-and consequently the value of that website depend on the domain name" and that
"[w]hen the domain name changes, the volume of traffic to the website will drop, as visitors are no
longer able to locate the website").
268.  See Dorer v. Abel, 60 F. Supp. 2d 558, 56i (E.D. Va. 1999) (acknowledging that there are
generic domains that are "extremely valuable to Internet entrepreneurs" because they can be "freely

associated Web site. Indeed, when a Web site is constructed and used in
connection with the sale of products or services, value might be added to
the domain name.7  Value is measured by the number of visitors to the
Web site and could be the result of a combination of factors, such as its
online  content,27' ease  of  navigation,  quality  products  or  services,  or
72
extensive and visible advertising.
In sum, the inherent value of a generic domain name (value distinct
from that added by the registrant or the person who has the right to use
the domain  name) is not the same as  "goodwill"  as defined in section
197.273  However,  value  added  by  the  registrant  after  a  Web  site  is
constructed  and the  domain name is used in connection  with the site,
could be considered  "goodwill"  within the  meaning  of section  197  (or
"trademark"  value  as  discussed  below).  In the latter case,  the domain
name is dependent on the value or goodwill added. Indeed, the domain
name could not be transferred without the value or goodwill added.
Domain Names as Trademarks
2. 
It has been suggested that domain names should be subject to the
same tax rules as trademarks. As discussed previously, amounts paid or
incurred  to  acquire  a  trademark  must  be  capitalized  and  deducted
ratably over fifteen years  under section  197, regardless  of whether the
trademark  is  acquired  separately  or  with  a  trade  or  business2.74  For

purposes of section 197, the term "trademark" "includes any word, name,
symbol,  or  device,  or  any  combination  thereof,  adopted  and  used  to
identify goods or services and distinguish them from those  provided by
others."2'75  Similarly,  a  trade  name  is  defined  as  "any  name  used  to
identify or designate  a particular trade  or business or the name  or title
used by a person or organization engaged in a trade or business.'276 Are
these  regulatory  definitions  broad  enough  to  include  domain names?
Domain names serve a  technical function of locating Web sites on the
Internet. This technical function is not enough for domain names to fall
within  section  197's  definition  of  "trademark"  or  "trade  name. 277
Therefore, the relevant issue becomes whether domain names serve any
other function so as to fall within the scope of section 197.
It is well established that certain domain names may be registered as
trademarks.  The  U.S. Patent  and  Trademark  Office  (PTO)  has issued
guidelines  on the registration  of domain names as trademarks.278 Under
the PTO policy, domain names are entitled to the protection afforded to
trademarks if they are arbitrary, fanciful, suggestive, or descriptive, with
acquired  secondary  meaning.79   Domain  names  that  are  merely
descriptive  or generic  are  not  entitled  to registration  in the  Principle

Obviously,  to  be  considered  as  a  potential  trademark  for
registration, a domain name must  function  as  a source indicator.  To
qualify as a trademark, the registrant or owner of the domain name must
use the domain name at its Web site to distinguish the goods or services
offered  there  and to indicate  the  source  of those goods  or  services.
More specifically, the Web site must be an active or interactive site that
offers goods or services using the domain name to identify the source of
the goods or services  at the home page or internal pages, capturing the
attention of Internet consumers. The domain name owner must use the
domain  name  in  advertisements  and  sales  in  connection  with  the
products or services  offered at the site.28  Such uses of domain names in
on-line commerce facilitate, in the mind of the consumer, an association
between  the domain  name  and  the  source of the  products  or services
offered at the Web site. Courts have consistently held that domain names

Internet.2
A domain name can be a word, phrase, or combination of words and
numbers. Whether all domain names are protected under trademark law
requires an examination of trademark jurisprudence.  Under trademark
law, the inquiry of whether a term is entitled to protection begins at the
classification of the term within the spectrum of distinctiveness."9 Within
the  spectrum  of  distinctiveness,  not  all  words  and  phrases  receive
protection under trademark law.9' Furthermore, the law does not accord
an equal level of protection  to all words  that qualify  as  trademarks2.9"
Determining whether a protected trademark is strong in the marketplace
requires  an  assessment  of  the  recognition  value  of  the  mark.93  A
conceptually  strong  trademark  does  not  necessarily  translate  into  a
commercially strong trademark."
Under trademark law, an arbitrary or fanciful trademark is accorded
the highest  level  of protection  because  it is  deemed  to  be inherently

distinctive.295 A common word that is used in an uncommon, unexpected
way to identify a source of goods or services is an arbitrary trademark.96
It has no real connection with its associated goods or services. Examples
of arbitrary trademarks include "Apple" for computers and "Camel"  for
cigarettes.297 A fanciful trademark is an invented, coined, non-dictionary
wordot that  is applie d in  "a  unique,  unfamiliar  usage for  the  express
purpose of serving as a trademark to be attached to a particular product,
but  bearing  no  identifying  trace  to  the  product  or  source."'99  Some
fanciful trademarks include Kodak, Clorox, Polaroid, and Exxon.3"
Descending  the  trademark  distinctiveness  spectrum,  we  see

consumers  to use  their imagination  to connect the  trademark  with its

factors  have been identified to help establish  secondary meaning. They
are (I)  advertising expenditures;  (2)  consumer studies linking the mark
to  a  source;  (3) unsolicited  media  coverage  of the  product;  (4)  sales

secondary  meaning  is  heavy,  and  proof  "entails  vigorous  evidentiary

generally  refers  to  "  the  genus  of  which  a  particular  product  is  a

name  faces  a  tremendous  task  of  proving  secondary  meaning.
Moreover, due to the nature of the Internet, users can access a Web site
by its descriptive  name by typing the term  as a keyword into a search
engine. This would pose difficult for a domain name holder who attempts

of secondary meaning." DeGidio, 355 F.3d at 513. Further, even if the plaintiff has spent millions of

metatags so that consumers searching for the key phrase 'Home-Market'  can find it easily.
It does not show, however, that many  consumers have  actually found or searched  for
plaintiff's services using that phrase such that it has become associated with plaintiff's web
site in the public mind.

"Home-Market.com"  is  a descriptive  term. Although  the  precise  nature  of plaintiff's
business  is not apparent from this language, it directly and clearly conveys the general
nature of the services it identifies. The term "Home" describes services related to homes,
"Market" indicates that the services are available to consumers, and ".com" is a well-known
top-level domain name indicating that the  services are  available through  the  Internet.
Because plaintiff's web-site referral  network markets  services related to homes over the
Internet,  it  can  be  stated  fairly  that  the  mental  leap  between  the  words  "Home-
Market.com" and the general attributes of the service it identifies is almost instantaneous.

reference to compact disc products and services) is generic and therefore
not entitled to trademark protection.338 Although generic domain names
are not entitled to trademark protection, they are greatly sought after by
many Internet companies. The trade-off  for selecting a  generic domain

the first day of the month in which the domain name is acquired and held in connection with either a
trade or business (within the meaning of section 162) or an activity conducted for profit (within the
meaning of section 212). I.R.C. Â§ I97(c)(I)(B); Treas. Reg. Â§ 1.197-2(f)(I)(i)(A). If a domain name
that functions as a trademark is acquired as part of the acquisition of an ongoing business, the total
amount paid for the business must be allocated among the various assets in order to determine the
basis of the domain name. If a business is acquired in an "applicable asset acquisition" under section
io6o, the total amount paid for the business must be allocated among the various acquired assets
(including the domain name) in accordance with the rules of section io6o (i.e., the basis of the domain
name  must be determined  under the  "residual  method"). An  applicable asset  acquisition is  any
transfer of a group of assets if the assets constitute a trade or business in the hands of either the
purchaser or the seller and the purchaser's basis in the assets can be determined wholly be reference to
the consideration paid. A group of assets constitutes a trade or business either if the use of those assets
would qualify as an active trade or business under section 355 or if goodwill or going concern value

The defendant claimed that "CDS"i s for compact disc products and services. The court found that the

the nature of the goods or services offered at the associated Web site3.39
The rationale for not allowing generic domain names to have trademark
protection  is rooted  in the well-established  "genericness"  doctrine. The
genericness  doctrine dictates that generic terms cannot be appropriated
or  monopolized;  all  may  use  words  that comprise  ordinary  language.
Indeed, no individual or entity may corner the market on a term used in
everyday speech to the exclusion of the public and competitors who may
seek, "at the risk of potential liability to one who laid claim to words of
common currency, to avail themselves of ordinary language to refer to an
article by its publicly accepted name."34  Under the genericness doctrine,
there is no trademark protection whatsoever  for generic terms, even if
the  terms  have  acquired  secondary  meaning3.4  This  rule  applies
regardless of how long a term has been used in marketing a particular
product or service, or how closely the term has come to be associated
with a particular source.34  Moreover, as the Supreme Court emphatically
announced sixty-six years ago, goodwill in a generic term is shared by all,
and its free exercise is in the interest of the public.343
The  question then  arises whether  the  costs of  purchasing  generic
domain  names  are  amortizable  under  section  197  like  the  costs  of
purchasing  domain  names  protected  under  trademark  law.  Some
commentators  have  suggested  that  generic  domain  names  might
339.  See Gundersen, supra note 321, at 20-21.
The first step, then, is to consider choosing a common or descriptive name versus choosing
an arbitrary or fanciful one. The usual trade-off exists between a descriptive name that
needs little promotion to be effective, but is harder to register and defend-versus  an
arbitrary or  fanciful  name  that needs  more  promotion,  but is  more defensible.  Each
approach  represents  a  valid  Internet  business  model,  but  each  has  different  legal
consequences-especially on the Internet.

constitute a trademark or trade name for tax purposes even if they do not
for intellectual property law purposes."l  In other words, generic domain
names may be included in the broad definition of a trademark or trade
name  under  section  197,  even  though  they  cannot  be  trademarked
because they are common names. To better understand this argument, a
closer look at the tax definitions of trademark and trade name is in order.
The regulations under section 197 define a trademark as "any word,
name, symbol, or device, or any combination thereof, adopted and used
to identify goods or services and distinguish them from those provided by
others."345  Similarly,  a  trade  name  is  defined  as  "any  name  used  to
identify or designate a particular  trade or business or the name  or title
used by a person or organization engaged in a trade or business."'6 More
importantly, according to some commentators, the regulations state that
"[a]  trademark  or trade name  includes  any trademark  or trade  name
arising  under statute  or applicable  common  law, and any similar right
granted  by  contract.3"'47  Relying  on  this  regulatory  definition,  one
commentator has suggested that generic domain names, even though not
able to be protected under trademark law, "can still serve to identify  a
certain company (or mascot) on the web and are registered  rights,"  and
thus are a "'similar right' granted by contract."'  Another commentator
has similarly suggested  that  a generic domain name might be a similar
right granted by contract:
[A]  domain name is adopted to identify a web site and to distinguish
that web site from web sites  provided by others. If a web site itself
could be deemed a 'service'  then all domain names would constitute 'a
similar right granted by contract' even though the domain name would
not be  a trademark  under the Lanham  Act....  Although we might
expect the definition of a trademark or trade name for tax purposes to
follow  that of  applicable  IP  law,  the  regulations  are  clearly  not  so
limited. The fact that the regulations refer to 'a similar right granted by
contract'  means that the definition  of a trademark or trade name for
tax purposes is broader than that under IP law.'4

Contrary  to  the  arguments  above,  the  definition  of  "trademark"
under tax law is similar to the definition of trademark provided under the
federal trademark statute, the Lanham Act. As noted above, regulations
under section  197  define a trademark  as  "any  word, name, symbol,  or
device, or any combination thereof, adoptedand used to identify goods
or  services  and  distinguish  them  from  those  provided  by  others."3"5
Similarly, the Lanham Act provides that a trademark is a "word, name,
symbol, or device,  or any combination thereof used by a person..,  to
identify and distinguish his or her goods...  from those manufactured  or
sold by others and to indicate the source of the goods, even if that source
is unknown."35' This strongly suggests that, like the Lanham Act, section
197 excludes generic  domain names that do not function as trademarks
because such names fail to identify and distinguish the associated goods
or  products  from  those  provided  by  others3.52   Identifying  and
distinguishing  goods  or  services  are  the  cornerstone  functions  of  a
trademark;  a domain  name  that is  unable  to do  so  is  therefore  not a
trademark under either section 197 or the Lanham Act.353
Moreover,  the  regulations  for  section  197  indicating  that  "[a]
trademark or trade name includes any trademark or trade name arising
under statute or applicable common law, and any similar right granted by
School of Law,  (Jan. 23,  2004)  (on file  with author). Professor Cameron notes that  "[t]he same

particular source."); In re Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc., 828 F.2d 1567,  1569-70 (Fed.

monopoly, since a competitor could not describe his goods as what they are" (citing CES Publ'g Corp.
v. St. Regis Publ'ns Inc., 531 F.2d I1, 13 (2d Cir. 1975))). Even the fact that the public may associate a
generic term with a particular source will not necessarily preclude a finding of "genericness." See, e.g.,
E. Air Lines, Inc. v. N.Y. Air Lines, Inc., 559 F. Supp. 1270, 1275 (S.D.N.Y. 1983).

contract,"  must  be  interpreted  consistently  with  the  definition  of
trademark provided in the plain language  of section  197.354 That means
that  "any  similar  right  granted  by  contract"  cannot  be  expanded  to
include a name that is not capable of identifying and distinguishing goods
or services of one source from those of another. Furthermore, statutory
interpretation  canons355  dictate  that  "any  similar  right  granted  by
contract"  must  be  parallel  to  and  cannot  be  in  conflict  with  a  right
"arising  under  statute  or  applicable  common  law., 356  Otherwise,  the
regulations defining trademarks and trade names could also include non-
trademarks in their scope, which would be an anomalous result.357
The interpretation of section  i97 and its regulations advocated  by
those who believe generic domain names are capable of identifying the
Internet company behind associated Web sites is contrary to established
law stating that generic words  are incapable  of identifying  a producer,
maker, or source. Generic words by their own nature identify products.
To say that generic domain names are capable of identifying their owners
would turn years of precedent  on its head. Interpreting  tax law  at the
detriment of well-established trademark law is hardly fulfilling the intent
of the drafters, carrying out tax policy, or serving the public good.
In addition, such interpretations  fall into a line of reasoning similar
to the argument that domain names  are rights under service  contracts.
Recent court decisions have squarely rejected the argument that domain
names are service contracts."' Courts have observed that this argument is

355.  "Under  the principle of ejusdem generis, when a general term follows a specific one, the
general  term  should  be  understood  as  a  reference  to  subjects  akin  to  the  one  with  specific
enumeration." Norfolk & W. Ry. Co. v. Am. Train Dispatchers' Ass'n, 499 U.S. 117, 129 (199).
356.  Circuit City Stores, Inc. v. Adams, 532 U.S.  io5,  io6 (2001),  is illustrative  of the maxim
ejusdem generis. There,  the  Court  interpreted  that "'any  other  class of workers engaged  in ...
commerce'  constitutes  a  residual  phrase, following,  in  the  same sentence,  explicit  reference  to
'seamen'  and 'railroad  employees.'  The wording thus calls for application of the maxim ejusdem
generis, under which the residual  clause should be read to give effect to the terms 'seamen'  and
'railroad employees,' and should be controlled and defined by reference to those terms." Id. (citation
omitted).

service contracts. Id.; see also Kremen v. Cohen, 337 F.3d 1024, 5030 (9th Cir. 2003) (holding that
domain names are characterized as property).November 2004]  TAXING THE NEW INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY  61
focused  on  the  role  of  the  registrar  (i.e.,  performing  registration
services), not the actual characterization  of domain names.359 The largest
domain name registrar, NSI, has also consistently taken the position that
domain names are not service contracts, but a form of property-some of
which are trademarks.36Â°
Finally, to support the conclusion that generic domain names should
be  excluded  from  the  definition  of  trademark  or  trade  name  under
section  197,  it is helpful to look at where generic domain names derive
their  value.  Some  domain  names  derive  their  value  from  their
relationship to a product, service, or the goodwill and reputation of the
business with which they are associated.,6' The owner of a domain name
can cultivate its value  through extensive  use of the name  in association
with  the  goods  and  services  sold  at the  Web  site,  through  years  of
marketing and advertising the name in connection with those goods and
services,  and  through  media  coverage  of the  name  in  the  industry.36'
These  names  are  not  valuable  if  they  do  not  have  the  attached
goodwill.363  In  fact,  an  assignment  of  words,  phrases,  symbols,  or
combination  thereof  without  the  associated  goodwill  has  long  been
established as a naked, invalid assignment. 64
In contrast to domain names that derive value from their association
with a product, service, or business (i.e., domain names that function as
trademarks), generic domain names are inherently valuable.,6 They can
be  freely sold, assigned, or transferred without associated  W' eb sites. 66

section 197 have one thing in common: they either constitute a portion of
a business (the first and second included intangibles) or have value only

trademarks  and trade names is in accordance with this idea. In fact, the

scope of any exception for intangibles acquired separately.37
Intellectual  property  rights  specifically  excluded from  section  i97,
such as  separately acquired patents and separately acquired  copyrights,
have something completely different in common: they are not linked to a
particular  business  but  instead  have  inherent  value.  Like  separately
acquired  patents and copyrights,  which are  not subject to section  197,
generic domain names, are not linked  to  any particular business,  have
inherent value, and can be legally transferred without any goodwill of a
business.373  Due to the nature of the Internet, the search methods often
employed by Internet users, and the unique nature of the domain name
assigning system, generic domain names possess inherent  value and are
valuable in the secondary market3.74 To carry out the clear congressional
intent  to exclude  from section  197  all those  intangibles  with  inherent
value, it would seem that generic domain names should be excluded from
section 197.
3.  Domain Names as Non-Trademarks
This article has concluded thus far that domain names should not be
treated for tax purposes as government licenses or contracts for services,
but instead should be treated as valuable intangible property. The article
has  further  concluded  that  domain  names  that  function  as  source
indicators are amortizable  under section 197, but those that do not (i.e.,
generic domain names)  fall outside the scope of section  197,  except for
any  "goodwill"  or "trademark"  value  accumulated  after a  Web  site is
constructed and the domain name is used at the Web site. The next issue
is whether the costs of a generic domain name are amortizable over any
other  Internal  Revenue  Code  provision  or  administrative
pronouncement.
As  a  general  rule,  if  section  197  does  not  apply  to  acquired
intellectual  property  rights, amortization  continues  to be governed  by
pre-section  197 law. Prior to the enactment  of section  197, section  167
permitted  a  taxpayer  to  amortize  the  capitalized  costs  of  acquiring
certain  intangible  property.  To be eligible  to  amortize  the capitalized
costs  of acquiring  intangible  property under section  167,  the  acquired
asset must have an ascertainable  useful life.  In other words, intangible
property not covered by section  197 may nevertheless be subject to an

amortization  allowance under  section  167  if the  intangible  property  is
"known  from experience  or other factors  to be of use  in  the trade  or
business or in the production  of income  for  only a limited period,  the
length  of  which  may  be  estimated  with  reasonable  accuracy.375
Intangible property with no ascertainable  useful life is not subject to the
allowance for amortization."6
Does a generic domain name have a determinable useful life so as to
be eligible  for amortization  under  section  167?  The regulations  under
section  167 provide that the useful life of an asset is not necessarily the
statutory legal life of the asset,  but rather is the "period over which the
asset may reasonably be expected  to be useful to the taxpayer  in his or
her  trade or  business or in  the production  of income.377 It  might  be
argued  that the useful  life of a domain name is  the initial  registration
period. After all, there is an initial domain name registration period for a
generic  domain  name  (e.g.,  I,  2,  5 or  io  years)  depending  on  the
agreement with the domain name registrar, and a domain name might be
lost if the registrant does not renew it.
Despite  the  suggestion  that a generic  domain  name  "can  still be
considered  an asset that can be amortized, '37s amortization of a generic
domain name  under section  167  is improper and  inconsistent with the
general,  pre-section  197  treatment  of  intangibles.  To  permit  generic
domain name acquisition costs to be written off over the domain name's
initial registration  period  makes little  sense. The initial period  is  often
short and would allow purchasers to recover substantial acquisition costs
over a  very  short recovery  period.  More  importantly, purchasers  often
plan to use domain names for periods extending  well beyond the initial
registration period. The cost to renew a generic domain name is minimal,
and for most purchasers, continued registration is expected.
To permit generic domain name purchasers  to pick an amortization
period over which they expect the generic domain names to be useful in
their business  is troublesome.  Generic  domain  names are  unlike other
amortizable  intangible  assets  with  inherent  value,  such  as  separately
acquired  patents  and  copyrights,  that  are  readily  susceptible  to  such

estimates. For example, a taxpayer can typically establish the useful life
of  a  patent  or copyright  for  amortization  purposes  based on  his  own
experiences with similar property3.79 If such experiences are inadequate, a
taxpayer can establish the useful life of a patent  or copyright based  on
general  industry standards.38Â° The same is  not true  for generic  domain
names. The useful life of a patent or copyright (and hence the recovery
period  over which  deductions  will be  allowed)  is  typically  tied  to  the
period  over  which  the  patent  or  copyright  will  most  likely  generate
income for the taxpayer. "  Indeed, the goal behind permitting taxpayers
depreciation or amortization deductions is to achieve a fair allocation of
the costs of acquiring an asset to the period in which the taxpayer realizes
income from the asset.58  The economic usefulness of a generic domain
name  cannot  be measured  by the domain  name's condition or by  the

eligible intangible property under section 167. The regulations under section 167 contemplate use of
the straight-line method of amortization, under which capitalized costs of acquiring eligible property
(less  salvage  value) are  deducted  ratably  over the property's  estimated useful  life. Treas.  Reg.

the straight-line method if the alternative method provides a more reasonable allowance. Treas. Reg.

common, alternative method for eligible intangible property acquisition costs is the income-forecast
method, under which costs of acquiring eligible intangible property are recovered as income is actually
earned from exploitation of the property. See Rev. Rul. 60-358, 1960-2 C.B. 68, amended by Rev. Rul.

property for which the income forecast method may be used. Eligible property includes interests in (t)

In short, the useful life of a generic domain name is unascertainable.
The  owner  of  a  generic  domain  name  today  cannot  be  the  owner
tomorrow if he forgets to renew the domain name registration. Yet, the
owner of a generic domain name  can bring a conversion  action against
the registrar who assigns the domain name to others without the original
owner's permission, given that the domain name registration at the time
of the assignment or transfer was valid. Although a generic domain name
can be acquired separately for its inherent value, the name itself does not
have an ascertainable useful life. Indeed, a generic domain name can last
forever, as long as the owner pays the registration fees.
In January 2004, the IRS issued final regulations under section  167
that provide  a  fifteen-year  safe  harbor amortization  period for certain
intangible  assets  that  do  not  have readily  ascertainable  useful  lives."'4
Under the safe harbor, amortization  is determined using a straight-line
method with no salvage value, consistent with amortization under section
197.3"5 Does this safe harbor amortization apply to generic domain names
when  amortization is not authorized  under  sections 197  or 167  of the
Code?
The  new  regulations  provide  that  "a  taxpayer  may  treat  an
intangible asset as  having a useful life equal to 15 years unless... [t]he
intangible  asset  is  described in  1.263(a)-4(c)  (relating  to  intangibles
acquired from another person)."''6 Treasury Regulation section 1.263(a)-
4(c) states: "A taxpayer must capitalize amounts paid to another party to
acquire  any  intangible from  that  party  in  a  purchase  or  similar
transaction.',,8'  That regulation then provides that intangibles within the
scope  of  section  I.263(a)-4(c)  "include, but are not limited to"  fifteen
specific  types  of intangibles provided  they are "acquired  from another
further support to the argument that generic domain names are not subject to amortization  under
section 167.
384. Treas. Reg. Â§ i.i67(a)-3(b).
385.  Id. Â§ I.i67(a)-3(b)(3)  (providing that the basis  of the intangible  asset, without  regard to
salvage value, is amortized ratably over the fifteen-year amortization period beginning on the first day
of the month in which the intangible asset is placed in service by the taxpayer).
386.  Id. Â§ I.67(a)-3(b)(I)(ii) (emphasis added). Also excluded from the safe harbor amortization
are  (i)  intangible  assets, the amortization  period  or useful  life for which  is already  specifically
prescribed or prohibited by the Code, the regulations thereunder, or other published guidance from

estimated; and (3) certain intangible benefits arising from the provision, production, or improvement
of real property. Id. Â§ i.I67(a)-3(b)(i)(i), (iii), (iv).

party  in  a  purchase  or  similar  transaction."' 88 An  interesting  issue  is
whether only those fifteen types of acquired intangibles listed in section
I.263(a)-4(c)(I)(i)-(xv)  are excepted  from  the safe harbor amortization
under section  i.i67(a)-3(b)(I)(ii)  as  intangibles  "described  in"  section
I.263(a)-4(c),  or, instead, whether all intangibles acquired from another
party are  excluded from the safe  harbor amortization.  If the  former is
true,  acquired  generic  domain  names  would  be  eligible  for  the  safe
harbor  amortization  since  generic  domain  names  are  not  among  the
fifteen listed intangibles. If, however, the latter is true, acquired generic
domain names would not be eligible.
It  would  seem  that  if  an  acquired  intangible  would  have  to  be
capitalized  under section  1.263(a)-4(c)  (as an acquired  generic domain
name  would),  then it would  fall  automatically  within the  exception  of
section  i.i67(a)-3(b)(I)(ii) and hence not be eligible for the safe harbor
amortization.  One might try to argue that the safe harbor provision of
section  i.i67(a)-3(b) should still apply even though capitalization  of the
costs of an acquired intangible is required under section I.263(a)-4(c). In
other words, perhaps there is a difference between an acquired intangible
that  must be  capitalized  under  the  "include,  but  are  not  limited  to"
language of section  I.263(a)-4(c)  and an acquired intangible "described"
in section I.263(a)-4(c)  as provided under section I.I67(a)-3(b)(i)(ii).
This interpretation  is  inconsistent with the explanation  of the safe
harbor  provision provided  in the Preambles  to both the proposed  and
final  regulations.  In  the  Preamble  to  the  proposed  regulations,  the
Service  states:  "The safe  harbor amortization  period does  not apply to
intangibles acquired from another party ...".3s '  The Preamble also states
that the safe harbor provision is intended to apply to "amounts paid to
obtain certain memberships  or privileges  of indefinite duration,"  assets
that are self-created and not acquired under section I.263(a)-4(d)(4). The
Preamble  to  the  final  regulations  clarify  that the  nonexclusive  list  of
intangibles  for  which  capitalization  is  required  is  "illustrative.""
Importantly,  the final  regulations modify  the introductory  language  to
specifically  state that the list contains  "examples"  of intangibles within
the scope of section I.263(a)-4(c).  Moreover, the final regulations make

clear  that  the  fifteen-year  safe  harbor  amortization  "applies  to
intangibles created on or after December 31, 2003. " '
The safe  harbor regulations  have  apparently  created  a  distinction
between  self-created  generic  domain  names  and  purchased  generic
domain  names.  The  capitalized  costs  of  creating  (registering  with  a
domain  name  registrar)  a  generic  domain  name  are  eligible  for  the
fifteen-year safe harbor amortization. In contrast, the capitalized costs of
acquiring  from another  party  (in  a  purchase  or  similar transaction)  a
generic domain name are not be eligible for the safe harbor amortization.
The  distinction  raises  some  important  questions.  Why  would  the
Treasury Department  permit the amortization  of a self-created  generic
domain name that has no determinable  useful life, but not an acquired
generic domain name  that has no determinable useful life? Should not
there be consistency  in  the tax treatment  of self-created  and  acquired
generic domain names?
The Treasury  was  aware  of  the inconsistency  it  created.  It  made
clear in the Preamble  to the proposed  regulations that the safe  harbor
amortization  period  applies  to  self-created  intangibles  with  no
ascertainable  useful  life,  but  not  to  acquired  intangibles  with  no
ascertainable useful life.392 The Treasury was not trying to ensure that all
intangible  assets  have  some  amortization  period  (exempting  acquiring
intangibles assuming  that they already fall within either section  197  or
another applicable amortization  provision, such as section 167).  In fact,
the  government  warned  taxpayers  in  the  Preamble  that  acquired
intangibles excluded from the safe harbor amortization rule may not be
amortizable  at all:  "These intangibles are generally not amortizable, are
amortizable  under  section  197,  or  are  amortizable  over  a  period
prescribed by other provisions of the Code or regulations."39'3 While it is
clear that the distinction was deliberate, the issue remains  whether the
tax system should treat self-created  generic domain names (i.e., costs of
registering  and  securing  a  generic  domain  name)  differently  from
acquired  generic  domain  names  (i.e.,  costs  of  purchasing  a  generic
domain  name  from another  party).  In other  words,  is the  distinction
justified, or has the government made a mistake?

costs  are  always  deductible  over  fifteen  years  regardless  of  whether

section 174 specifically provide that research  and experimental  expenditures include  the costs of
obtaining a patent. Treas. Reg. Â§ I.174-2(a)(I). Such costs include not only expenses incurred in the

experimental expenditures as "all reasonable costs incident to the development of a product, including
any pilot, model, process, formula, invention, technique, or similar property."  Treas. Reg. Â§ 1.174-

patentable technology or even know-how).

398.  Internal Revenue Code section 263A requires a taxpayer to capitalize all direct and indirect
expenditures incurred to produce tangible personal property as part of a trade or business or activity
conducted for profit. I.R.C. Â§ 263A. Although section 263A mentions "tangible personal property,"
the phrase actually applies to several types of intangible property. The phrase "tangible property" is
defined under the Code to include "a film, sound recording, video tape, book, or similar property that
embodies the words, ideas, concepts, images, or sounds by the creator thereof." Id. Â§ 263A(b). As can
be  seen,  section  263A  applies to numerous  forms  of intellectual  property  for which copyright
protection  is  available.  Section  26 A(h),  however,  provides  an  important  exemption  from  the
3
capitalization requirements of section 263A in the case of certain writers, photographers, and artists.
Id. Â§ 263A(h). Section 263A(h), which was added to the Code in 1988, provides that "qualified creative
expenses" are not required to be capitalized. Id. A qualified creative expense is defined as any expense
paid or incurred by an individual in the trade or business of being a "writer," "photographer,"  or
"artist,"  which, except  for the  uniform capitalization  rules of section  263A, would  otherwise be
deductible for the taxable year. Id. Â§ 26 A(h)(2). If the exemption applies, qualified creative expenses

are usually deductible when paid or incurred. Id. Â§ 162(a).HASTINGS LAW JOURNAL [VOL. 56:1
separately).3" Finally, the costs of building the goodwill in a trademark or
trade name (i.e., advertising costs) are immediately deductible,4" whereas
the costs of acquiring a trademark or trade name must be amortized over
fifteen years.4"' In each case, the creation costs receive the preferable tax
treatment via a current deduction.42
Whenever the tax system treats intellectual property creation costs
differently from intellectual property acquisition costs, there is usually a
good  reason  for  it.  For  example,  Congress  permits  the  immediate
deduction  of  most  patent  and  trade  secret  creation  costs  that would
otherwise  have  to  be  capitalized  in  order  to  encourage  research  and
development.4'0   Furthermore,  Congress  permits  most  writers,
photographers, and artists to immediately deduct their copyright creation
costs  in  order to  relieve  them  from  the  burdens  of the  capitalization
rules,  especially  when  their  activities  may  not  generate  income  for
years.4'  While sound policy reasons exist for treating self-created patents,
trade  secrets,  and  copyrights  differently  from  acquired  intellectual
property,  is  there  any  good  reason  for  treating  self-created  generic
domain names differently from acquired generic domain names? Is there
some  societal  benefit  of encouraging  taxpayers  to  register  their  own
generic domain names rather than purchasing them? One would have to
stretch to answer these in the affirmative.
The  safe  harbor  amortization  regulations  did  achieve  something
399. For the tax treatment of copyright creation costs, see supra Part II.B.
400. There are certain expenses associated with trademarks and trade names that are not required
to be  capitalized  and  amortized  over fifteen  years. There  is  authority  holding that  advertising
expenditures  may be deducted in full in the year paid or incurred. In Revenue  Ruling 92-80,  the
Service ruled that most advertising expenditures are immediately deductible under section 162 of the
Code  notwithstanding the  fact that advertising expenses often give rise to benefits  that last well
beyond the current year. Rev. Rut. 92-8o,  1992-2 C.B. 57. This is a significant ruling since advertising
costs are often incurred in developing the goodwill of trademarks and trade names (i.e.,  incurred in
gaining customer acceptance  and identification of trademarks and trade names). Such expenses are
currently deductible. See supra note 134.

worthy. They brought any capitalized costs of creating trade secrets and
know-how within the fifteen-year safe harbor amortization period so as
to be in line with the tax treatment of capitalized costs of acquiring trade
secrets  and know-how. Under current  tax rules, if patent development
costs  are  not  eligible  to  be  deducted  immediately,  such  costs  are
amortizable  over  the  patent's  useful life  (similar  to  the  treatment  of
patent  purchase  costs).0'  Similarly,  if copyright  creation  costs are  not
eligible to  be deducted  currently, such costs  are  amortizable  over  the
copyright's  useful life  (similar  to the  treatment  of copyright  purchase
costs).4Â°6 In each case,  any  development  costs  that  are not eligible for
current  deduction  are amortized  over  the developed  property's useful
life, just as if the property were acquired separately.4'
Prior  to  the  promulgation  of  the  safe  harbor  amortization
regulations, however, if trade secret development costs were not eligible
to be  deducted immediately,  such costs were  not amortizable  at all.48
Amortization was not available under section 197 since self-created trade
secrets and know-how are not included  within the definition  of section

While  the  safe  harbor  amortization  regulations  reconciled  the
treatment of self-created trade secrets and acquired  trade secrets, it had
the opposite effect on generic domain names. Prior to their adoption, the
costs  associated  with  both  self-created  and  acquired  generic  domain
names were not amortizable. Now, under the regulations, the capitalized
costs of registering  a generic  domain name  are subject  to fifteen-year
amortization, whereas the costs of purchasing a generic domain name are
not amortizable at all.4
IV.  NEW RULES NEEDED GovERNING NEW INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
RIGHTS
While the costs of registering or purchasing a domain name almost
certainly  must  be capitalized,  uncertainties  remain  over whether  such
capitalized  costs  can  be  amortized.  This  Article  has  suggested,  after
analyzing  the legal  nature  of domain names and  the current  tax rules
governing  traditional  intangible  property  rights,  that  amortization
depends on several factors. The costs of both registering and purchasing
a  domain  name  that  functions  as  a  trademark  are  amortizable  over
fifteen years under section 197. The costs of registering a generic domain
name  are  also  amortizable  over  fifteen  years  pursuant  to  recent
regulatory authority and not pursuant to any Code provision. The costs
of purchasing a generic domain name, in contrast, are not amortizable at
all unless it can be shown  that a  portion of the cost is  attributable  to
"goodwill"  or "trademark" value.
Applying  current  tax  rules,  which  deal  only  with  traditional
intellectual property and intangible rights, to domain names has yielded
problematic  results. For example,  acquired generic  domain names  are
not amortizable  at all.  This  is  troubling  in light  of the fact  that most
intangible  property  with  significant  value  is  amortizable  over  some
period, either  the  arbitrary  fifteen-year  recovery  period  under section
197 or the intangible property's useful life under section  167. If valuable
413. Treasury  Regulation  section  1.167(a)-3(b)  now  provides  for  a  fifteen-year  period  for
amortization of capitalized trade secret creation costs, whereas section 197 provides for a fifteen-year
period for amortization of capitalized trade secret acquisition costs. It is uncertain why Congress did
not merely amend section 197.
414. Presumably, the registration costs would be treated as "creation" costs falling within the safe
harbor amortization rule of section i.I67(a)-3(b). Purchasing costs, on the other hand, clearly would

intangible  business  assets  such  as  goodwill,  going  concern  value,
trademarks, and trade names are amortizable, why are acquired generic
domain names not amortizable? Is it because generic domain names do
not fit the characteristics of goodwill or trademarks under non-tax law? It
seems  that the approach  of trying to  classify domain  names  as  one  or
more variations of existing intellectual or intangible property rights, and
then looking for the  appropriate  current  tax rules  dealing  with those
variations, has produced an unsatisfactory tax regime for domain names.
For example, there  is a  distinction under current tax law between
domain names that function as trademarks and those that do not. What
happens if a portion of the value of a generic domain name derives from
its  association  with a  particular  business?  Should  the  generic domain
name  now  be  considered  two  assets,  one  with  inherent  value  (not
amortizable)  and  the  other  with  either  goodwill  or  trademark  value
(amortizable)? Consider the following example:
"Car.com"  is a domain name where  "car" is a generic  word such as
vitamins, wireless, and loans. The name is owned and used by a Web
site that at first was not an active business. Subsequently, the Web site
receives repeated unique hits and develops a large and loyal customer
base. The Web site owner then decides to sell the business, including
the domain name, which now has a market value of $5.5 million."'
According to one commentator:
A portion of the value of the name derives from its association with the
business.  So to some  extent, the name  should  be treated  as  having
trademark  value.  The remaining  value  is the name's inherent value.
The  inherent  and trademark  values in  this  transaction  are  separate
assets, and their values have  different sources. One  derives from the
inherent  value of the exclusive  use of a generic  term, and the other
derives from the goodwill of the business."
It would follow then, under existing tax rules, that a portion of the
cost of a generic domain name would be eligible for  amortization, and
the other portion of the cost would not be eligible for amortization.
This  approach  would  result  in  much  litigation  concerning  the
identification  of  and  valuation  of generic  domain  names.  Because  no
amortization  would  be  allowed  for  the  inherent  value  of  a  generic
domain name, taxpayers would try to distinguish trademark value from
inherent  value  in  a  single  domain  name,  and  the  Service  would
415. For a similar example, see Hardesty, supra note 162, at 370.
416. Id.HASTINGS LAW JOURNAL [Vo1. 56:1
undoubtedly  challenge  their  determinations.  Taxpayers  who  have  the
resources  to  litigate  over  the  identification  and  valuation  of  generic
domain names would  be better off than those taxpayers  who lack  such
resources. Needless to say, fitting generic domain names within existing
tax rules would produce much litigation and uncertainty.
This  article  has  illustrated  the  inadequacies  of current  tax law  in
dealing  with  Internet  domain  names.  These  inadequacies  and
uncertainties  are becoming more apparent with the emergence  of new
forms of intellectual property rights. As with domain names, no special
tax  rules  exist  specifically  governing  the  tax  treatment  of  Web  site
creation  and  acquisition  costs.  Taxpayers  and  advisors  are  left  with
questions such as: Should the costs related to the development of a Web
site be treated the same as software development costs? How should the
costs of creating or purchasing content for Web sites be treated? Does it
make  a  difference  if  some  Web  site  content  is  copyrightable  or
noncopyrightable?
If  Web  sites  are  considered  variations  of  existing  intellectual  or
intangible property rights to which existing tax law can be adopted, then
the  tax  treatment  of  Web  sites  may  depend  on  the  Web  site's
components  (e.g.,  software,  copyrightable  content,  noncopyrightable
content). This  result could  produce varying  rules not easily applied  in
practice. For example, if the Service agrees that the basic structure of a
Web  site  (the  permanent  portion  of  the  site)  should  be  treated  as
"software,"  a Web  developer would be able to immediately  deduct the
costs of building the basic structure of the site under Revenue Procedure
2000-50.4'7  If a taxpayer incurred costs to develop copyrightable content
such as literary text, music, photographic images, art works, graphics, and
sound, such costs would either be currently deductible or amortized over
the useful life of the copyright.4'8 If a taxpayer incurred costs to develop

Rev. Proc. 2000-50, 2000-2 C.B. 6o.  Under such a definition, designing a Web site with HTML

noncopyrightable content, such costs might not have to be capitalized. 9
If the costs of developing noncopyrightable  content must be capitalized,
they would only be amortizable if a useful life could be established.":
Again,  current  and  historical  tax concepts  (section  197  and  pre-
section  197 law) do not translate smoothly with respect to the expansion
of existing rights for certain  intangible assets or, more importantly,  the
emergence  of  new  intellectual property  and  intangible  rights  such  as
domain names.  An unfortunate  trend  that is developing  is  an  ad hoc
response  by administrative  bodies to fill in the gaps. For example,  the
Service  issued  an  administrative  pronouncement,  Revenue  Procedure
2000-50, to clarify the uncertain  tax treatment of software development
costs  in  light  of  the  fact  that  software  now  may  be protected  under
patent,  copyright,  and  trade  secret  law.42'  More  recently,  the  Service
adopted new regulations under section 167, Treasury Regulation section
I.I67(a)-3(b),  to provide  a fifteen-year  safe harbor amortization period
for created intangibles that do not have an ascertainable useful life.
Each  time the Service  responds to inadequacies  in the current tax
law, new issues are raised and  additional uncertainties  are created.  An
interesting  issue,  for  example,  is  whether  the  Treasury  had  legal
authority to create a fifteen-year safe harbor amortization period under
section 167 when intangible assets that are not subject to section 197 (and
do  not  have  ascertainable  useful  lives)  have  not  previously  been
amortizable. Several arguments  can be made against the validity of the
safe-harbor  amortization  regulations.  First,  because  the  section  167
regulations  were  in  effect  for  almost  fifty  years,  Congress  tacitly
approved the old system, which permitted amortization  only if a useful
life  could  be  established.  Second,  because  the  statutory  authority  of
section  197 was necessary to allow the amortization of a variety of types
of intangible assets that did not have ascertainable  useful lives, Congress
reserves the power to modify it. Finally, the Treasury may have exceeded
its authority to interpret a statute since its action was so overly expansive
419. Id.

421.  The tax  treatment  of software  costs  is  beyond  the  scope  of this article.  However,  an
interesting issue with respect to software is whether there should be three different tax treatments
depending  on  the  protection  sought  (patent,  copyright,  trade  secret).  Recognizing  potential
uncertainties, the Service issued Revenue  Procedure 2000-50 providing that software development
costs may be deducted currently regardless of whether the software is patented or copyrighted or trade
secret protected. Rev. Proc. 2000-50,2002-2 C.B. 6ot.HASTINGS LAW JOURNAL [Vol. 56:1I
as to determine tax policy.
A better approach  would  be for  Congress  to revisit  section  197's
treatment of intangible assets. Section  197 has received little legislative
attention  since  its  enactment  over ten  years  ago.  With the  arrival  of
global electronic  commerce  transactions  on the  Internet, the nature  of
cyberspace will undoubtedly require new tax rules.
CONCLUSION
What  should  you  advise  your  CEO  with  respect  to  the  possible  tax
treatment for his acquisition of the domain name "men.com"? The easy
answer would  be  to say  that there  is no  current  tax  rule  specifically
dealing with such new.intellectual  property acquisition  costs. The more
complex  answer would  require you to characterize  the new intellectual
property right  in  the context  of current  tax rules  on  various forms  of
intangibles  acquisitions.  You  may  conclude  that  fitting  the  new
intellectual property right into existing law is like pressing a round ball
through a smaller sqflare hole. Perhaps it is time for a complete overhaul
of the current intangible tax regime and a better model for the taxation
of intellectual property.
