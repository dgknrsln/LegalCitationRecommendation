FINANCING INNOVATION:  LEGAL DEVELOPMENT OF
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AS SECURITY IN FINANCING,
1845-2014
XUAN-THAO NGUYEN*
INTRODUCTION
Commentators have repeatedly raised questions about the United States’
ability to continue to be an innovative nation.1  Some complained that compared
to other countries with higher rates on innovation, the United States has fallen
behind due to lack of funding for research.2  Small businesses, known for being
incubators of new ideas and job creation, continue to face major obstacles in
obtaining government funding and financing from lenders.3  While lenders are
willing to extend credit to large businesses, they often ignore small businesses.4

The dire financing situation faced by small businesses today is similar to the
credit squeeze during and after the epic financial crisis in 2009.5
Without funding from both public and private sectors, small businesses
cannot operate their companies, innovate for new ideas, and foster employment
growth.6  The United States may soon lose its edge in innovation.  How can
financing be made available for small businesses that most often own neither real
property nor tangible assets?  
Small businesses have ideas, trademarks, content, know-hows, and other
intangible assets.7  These intangible properties can be used as collateral to obtain
financing from the private sector.8  Lenders must be willing to accept this type of
property as collateral in order for credits to be extended to small businesses. 
Creditors must overcome their reluctance in these commercial transactions.  This
Article argues that lenders should take great comfort in making loans to small
businesses with intellectual property assets serving as collateral.  The United
States has a long legal history of paving the path for financing innovation, as seen
through the development of decisional law spanning from 1845 to the present.9 
The established history of lending with intellectual property collateral is uniquely
American.10  Recourses and remedies under strong rules of law system are readily
available  for  secured  lenders  and  creditors  who  are  willing  to  finance
innovation.11
The Article proceeds as follows.  Part I traces the development of embracing
patents, copyrights and trademarks in chattel mortgages.  This part analyzes early
cases, including the seminal case, Waterman v. Mackenzie,12 in patent mortgages,
and their significance in recognizing the incorporeal property and the right of the
mortgagee.  Additionally, Part I focuses on the development in copyright statutes
in relation to the use of copyrights in mortgages.  Most importantly, the arrival
of new technologies necessitated the increase of financing for the creation and
distribution  of  copyrighted  content  and  legal  developments  in  the  area  of
foreclosure of copyright mortgages.13  Part I also examines whether trademarks
were used in chattel mortgages during the similar period of patent and copyright

mortgages.  Due to the nature of trademarks, the stricter view of trademarks and
their  attached  goodwill,  trademark  mortgages  faced  certain  limitations.14 
Recognizing the limitations of trademark mortgages, this section compares how
patent, copyright and trademark provisions differ statutorily in their recording
requirements for mortgages. 
Part  II  moves  to  the  post-war  period  of  robust  economic  growth  and
commercial law reform nationwide.  The adoption of Article 9 of the Uniform
Commercial  Code  marks  a  new  era  of  creating  uniform  law  for  states  to
encourage financing based on personal property as the backbone of economic
growth.15  Paralleling the development in uniform commercial law, historic
milestones  in  intellectual  property  law  are  seen  through  the  overhauls  in
trademark  law,  patent  law,  and  copyright  law  that  modernized  intellectual
property law.16  Part II traces the intersection of Article 9 of the Uniform
Commercial Code and intellectual property law.  This intersection led to new
approaches to patent collateral, copyright collateral, and trademark collateral.17 
Particularly, the old mortgages were replaced with a new understanding and
practice of security interest in modern secured transactions.18   In addition,
challenging issues relating to whether federal or state law will govern perfection
of  intellectual  property  must  be  resolved  in  order  for  financing  based  on
intellectual property to flourish.19 
Part III looks beyond financing based on intellectual property in the private
sector.  This part will examine the United States’ government’s role in financing
small businesses with intellectual property assets.  The United States Small
Business Administration has a history of extending loans to small businesses and
accepting intellectual property as security for the repayment of loans.20  This
section will analyze decisional law for a comprehensive understanding of both the
practice and legal development of the government’s financing for small business
innovation. 
Part  IV  shifts  to  contemporary  issues  arising  in  financing  innovation. 
Specifically, this part dissects the recourse and remedies available to secured
creditors in financing innovation when the borrower could not fulfill payment
obligations.  This part analyzes recent Federal Circuit decisions determining
whether a secured party of intellectual property collateral becomes the owner of
the intellectual property by operation of law in post default.  Predictability as to
ownership of intellectual property collateral in post default will enhance financing

of innovation.21
There are some risks associated with financing innovation.22  Part V identifies
and assesses the risks.  Notably, the risks include whether a grant of security
interest in some circumstances is deemed a fraudulent transfer and whether the
secured creditor is liable for infringement.23  However, these risks are rare in
financing innovation by the private sector.24
Learning from the development of financing innovation from 1845 to the
present,  Part  VI  offers  observations  and  discusses  implications  for  future
financing of innovation.  There is a need for both traditional and online lenders
to appreciate the intellectual property assets held by small businesses.25  The
intellectual property assets should be included in the analytics in assessing the
overall health of a business seeking a loan or a line of credit for its new
innovative product, idea, or vision.26  The Article ends with a brief conclusion
that in order to maintain the United States’ innovative edge, attention to the
access to financing by small businesses must be at the center of the discussion,
and intellectual property must be recognized as part of that center.
I.  EMBRACING INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY MORTGAGES
In 1790, Congress passed the first patent and copyright statutes during its
very first year of governing the new country.27  Appreciating the importance of
intellectual property in the development of the new nation, the new statutes and
subsequent amendments provided a uniform system relating to the eligibility for
receiving legal protection, duration of protection, infringement, remedies and
transfers of ownership.28  The idea of using patents, copyrights and trademarks

as security for payment obligations did not exist during the late eighteenth
century, but the use of chattel or personal property29 as security for debt or chattel
mortgage was common practice.30 
Chattel  mortgage  transactions  and  law  developed  during  the  Colonial
America  period.31    In  a  chattel  mortgage,  the  mortgagor  conveyed  to  the
mortgagee the right, title and interest in the chattels to secure the payment of a
debt, upon condition that the transfer would be voided by the mortgagor’s
subsequent timely payment of the debt.32  The chattel mortgage financing allowed

argued that the United States government has recognized the importance of intellectual property
and purposefully created patent law and amendments to protect the interests of domestic businesses
and inventors.  See William Hubbard, Competitive Patent Law, 65 FLA. L. REV. 341, 356-58 (2013)

individuals and businesses to gain access to financing and reduced the lender’s
risks.33 
After the American Revolution, intellectual property assets slowly became
important and valuable, and lenders began to accept them in chattel mortgages.34 
Questions regarding the scope of a mortgagee’s right in the mortgaged intellectual
property arose in due course.35  The mortgagee wanted to know whether they
could bring an infringement suit against others during the time period when the
mortgagor had not fulfilled the payment obligations36 and whether recording a
patent mortgage would vest the mortgagee with the entire title in the patent.37
Another unanswered question was, under federalism separating the jurisdictions
of federal and state courts, which law would govern the foreclosure of mortgaged
patents and copyrights.38  In addition, there was not a settled opinion as to
whether trademarks should be mortgaged like patents and copyrights.39  Early
cases addressed these questions, thereby widening the path for financing with the
use of intellectual property in mortgages.40
A.  Patent Mortgages
The United States Supreme Court widely opened the door for financing with
the use of patent assets as security in the famous Waterman v. Mackenzie decision
in 1891.41  In that case, Mrs. Waterman borrowed $6500 from Asa L. Shipman
Townsend, 2 Mass. 493, 494 (Mass. 1807) (recognizing a land mortgage wherein the defendant
“pleads a bond dated the same day, in the penal sum of 500 dollars, with a condition—after reciting
that the defendant, owing the plaintiff 241 dollars 30 cents, and for the better securing the payment
of the same, had conveyed to the plaintiff fifty acres of land—that, if the defendant should pay the
plaintiff that sum in six months, and the plaintiff shall then reconvey the land to the defendant, the
bond was to be void.”).

England and the Netherlands were eager to lend to planters in Virginia and took security in

plantation economy paved the way for small planters to seek “greater wealth through expansion
based on secured loans”).

& Son on November 25, 1884.42  To secure the payment on the promissory note,
Mrs. Waterman mortgaged the patent relating to inventions of fountain pens
obtained by her inventor-husband by executing a conditional assignment, which
contained an express provision that the assignment should be null and void if the
payment obligation was paid on the due date.43  As mortgagee, Asa L. Shipman
& Sons and its subsequent assignee, Asa L. Shipman, timely recorded the patent
mortgage with the Patent Office.44  Mr. Waterman transferred the ownership in
the patents to his wife on February 13, 1884, received a license to manufacture
under the patents from his wife on November 20, 1884, and brought a patent
infringement action against an alleged infringer.45  The alleged infringer in turn
challenged the plaintiff for lack of standing to maintain the suit, as the patents had
already been mortgaged.46  At the time of the infringement suit, Mrs. Waterman
had not fulfilled the payment obligation to Asa L. Shipman.47
By recording the patent mortgage with the Patent Office, the Court ruled that
the entire title in the patent, both in law and equity, was acquired by the
mortgagee, Asa L. Shipman.48  Therefore, the mortgagee enjoyed all rights in the
mortgaged patents, including the right to maintain a patent infringement action.49 
The Court began its analysis by first recognizing that the executed “assignment”
between Mrs. Waterman and Asa L. Shipman was an “instrument, being a
conveyance made to secure the payment of a debt, upon condition that it should
be avoided by the subsequent payment of that debt at a time fixed, was a
mortgage, in apt terms, and in legal effect.”50
The Court then distinguished mortgages in personal property, like patents,
from those of real estate.51  The Court observed that in real estate financing, the
mortgagor has possession of the land and is the equitable owner of the property
and the mortgagee has either bare legal title or merely a lien on the property,
depending on state laws.52

and more considered as a mere security for the debt, creating a lien or encumbrance only, and
leaving the title in the mortgagor, subject to alienation, levy on execution, dower, and other
incidents of a legal estate; but the rules upon the subject vary in different states, and a mortgage is
everywhere considered as passing the title in the land, so far as may be necessary for the protection516 INDIANA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 48:509
In personalty mortgages, however, the Court noted that “it is not merely the
possession or a special property that passes; but, both at law and in equity, the
whole title is transferred to the mortgagee, as security for the debt.”53  That meant
the personalty mortgagee enjoyed both the equitable title and the legal title to the
personal  property.54    The  whole  title  is  subject  “only  to  be  defeated  by
performance of the condition” described in the mortgage instrument.55  In other
words, the law for personalty mortgage is clearly different from the law for
pledges and realty mortgage.56  Although the personalty mortgagee does not have
possession of the property like in pledges, the entire title to the property has
already passed to the mortgagee to secure the loan provided to the mortgagor
from the mortgagee.57   
Moreover, the Court stated, “a recording of the mortgage is a substitute for,
and (unless in case of actual fraud) equivalent to, a delivery of possession, and
makes the title and the possession of the mortgagee good against all the world.”58 
That meant if the mortgagee adheres to the recording statute for personalty
mortgage,  the  mortgagee  will  be  accorded  with  possessory  rights  and  the
recording serves as notice to all for priority purposes.59
Applying to the case at hand, noting that a patent right is “incorporeal
property,” the Court commented that neither actual delivery nor possession could
occur.60  Therefore, the recording of the patent mortgage with the United States
Patent Office in accordance with patent law “is equivalent to a delivery of
possession, and makes the title of the mortgagee complete towards all other
persons, as well as against the mortgagor.”61
In deciding the scope of the patent mortgagee’s rights, the Court analogized

and distinguished patent mortgages from land mortgages.62  The Court observed
that, in a land mortgage transaction, even without possession of the land, the
mortgagee may obtain an “action for an injury to his interest,” an injunction or
damages for activities as “tends to impair the value of the mortgage security, or
as is not allowed by good husbandry or by express or implied license from the
mortgagee.”63  Most importantly, only the mortgagee had standing to maintain
suit,  “and  not  by  the  mortgagor  or  any  one  claiming  under  a  subsequent
conveyance from him.”64  In a patent mortgage, however, the Court is concerned
about patent rights.65  Unlike land rights, the right conferred by a patent is limited
in years, and the patent’s value is primarily “in the profits derived from royalties
and license fees.”66  The Court therefore declared:
In analogy to the rules governing mortgages of lands and of chattels, and
with even stronger reason, the assignee of a patent by a mortgage duly
recorded, whose security is constantly wasting by the lapse of time, must
be held (unless otherwise provided in the mortgage) entitled to grant
licenses, to receive license fees and royalties, and to have an account of
profits or an award of damages against infringers.67
Accordingly, the Court held that the patent mortgagee is accorded the status of
“the party interested, either as patentee, assignee, or grantee,” and has the right
to bring suit against others at law and suit in equity “to recover damages for an
infringement.”68  Consequently, in the present case, the patent mortgagee, Asa L.
Shipman, was entitled to maintain an infringement action against others.69  Mrs.
Waterman therefore had no standing because she had already mortgaged the
patents to Asa L. Shipman.70  In reaching a conclusion, the Court explicitly
rejected the law propounded under the English Judicature Act of 1873 and the
Patent Act of 1883 wherein only the mortgagor of a patent was allowed to
maintain a suit for infringement.71

Waterman v. Mackenzie is significant for several reasons.  First, land and real
estate are no longer the only security property for secured financing.72  Second,
creditors are willing to extend loans to debtors with patents and other personal
property served as security.73  Third, the mortgagee can enjoy all of the debtor’s
rights, title, and interest in the patent if the mortgagee properly recorded the
patent mortgage.74  The rights in the patents cover the right to grant licenses, to
collect fees and royalties, and to receive damages and accounting of profits
against infringers.75  Fourth, the patent mortgagee has standing to maintain suit
against others for infringement of the mortgaged patent.76  Consequently, the
mortgagee would be able to reduce its exposure in the event the debtor fails to
make payment.77  Also, the mortgagee’s rights in the patent mortgage accords it
with the status of “the party interested” similar to patentee, assignee, or grantee
during the entire time while the patent serves as collateral for the mortgage
transaction.78  Overall, Waterman v. Mackenzie encourages the financial industry
to provide financing to individuals and entities with patents that could be used in
chattel mortgage financing.79
B.  Copyright Mortgages
Patents were not the only type of intellectual property eligible for mortgages
in the nineteenth century.80  Copyright mortgages were associated with book and
music publishing.81  Moreover, copyright laws during this time mentioned
maintain a suit for infringement, under the provisions of the English Judicature Act of 1873 and
Patent Act of 1883.  St. 36 & 37 Vict. c. 66, § 25; 46 & 47 Vict. c. 57, §§ 23, 46, 87.  Whether, in
a suit brought by the mortgagee, the court, at the suggestion of the mortgagor, or of the mortgagee,
or of the defendants, might, in its discretion, and for the purpose of preventing multiplicity of suits
or miscarriage of justice, permit or order the mortgagor to be joined, either as a plaintiff or as a
defendant, need not be considered, because no such question is presented by this record.”).

copyright mortgages in the recordation provision.82  Indeed, in 1834, Congress
included the recordation requirement for assignments of copyright.83  If an
assignment was not recorded within 60 days of the execution, it was to be
“judged fraudulent and void against any subsequent purchaser or mortgagee for
valuable consideration without notice.”84  Also, in 1909, Congress consolidated
and created the comprehensive Copyright Act.85  Under the 1909 Copyright Act,
section 42 permitted copyrights to be assigned and mortgaged.86  Section 44
required that assignments of copyrights must be recorded within three months of
execution  in  order  for  it  to  be  valid  against  subsequent  purchasers  and
mortgagees.87 
Mortgages  on  copyrights  became  more  prevalent  with  the  arrival  of
technologies  for  new  mediums  of  expression,  copying,  and  distribution,
especially in the area of motion pictures and television.88  Republic Pictures Corp.

and manuscript composition of a motion picture photoplay based on a story
entitled, “A Song For Miss Julie.”90  Pre-Em Pictures received certain advances
from the Security-First National Bank of Los Angeles and provided the bank with
the copyright in the motion picture as security for the advances.91  Later, Pre-Em
Pictures defaulted on the loans and the bank sued Pre-Em Pictures in federal court
to foreclose on the mortgaged copyright.92  The district court  ordered the
foreclosure, and the copyright was sold to the bank at public auction by the
United States Marshal.93
Republic  Pictures  was  the  distributor  of  the  motion  picture  under  an
agreement with Pre-Em Pictures.94  Republic Pictures refused to recognize the
title in the copyrights purchased by the bank at public auction.95  The bank then
sued Republic Pictures for declaratory relief to determine the rights in the
copyright acquired by the bank.96  The case was appealed to the Ninth Circuit.97
The  Ninth  Circuit  held  that  federal  courts  have  no  jurisdiction  over
foreclosure  of  copyright  mortgages  even  though  they  have  subject  matter
jurisdiction over copyrights.98  Foreclosures on mortgaged copyrights are within
the provenance of state courts and state law.99  The court indicated that it was
merely following other courts’ decisions on foreclosures of mortgaged patents.100
The  reasoning  in  Republic  Pictures  further  aided  the  development  of
intellectual  property  financing  law.    It  followed  federalism  principles  by
recognizing that certain areas of law, such as copyrights and patents are within
federal subject matter jurisdiction, and other areas of law, such as commercial
law, are within state subject matter jurisdiction.101  The court in Republic Pictures
exercised restraint as dictated by the Constitution.102  By so doing, it respected the
development of secured transactions law at the state level despite the fact that the
collateral property involved federally granted rights.103

patent  and  copyright  mortgages.104    Trademark  mortgages,  however,  faced
limitations.105  The view of courts at that time was that trademarks could not be
transferred without the underlying business; therefore, trademarks could not by
themselves,  apart  from  the  business,  be  used  as  security  in  mortgages.106 
Consequently, unlike patent mortgages, where a simple recording with the Patent
Office would bestow the mortgagee with rights similar to those of the patentee
or grantee while the patent mortgagor continued to use the mortgaged patents in
the  operation  of  its  business,107  mortgages  with  trademarks  were  more
cumbersome.108 
For example, in Morgan v. Rogers, J. Miller & Sons (“Miller & Sons”)
manufactured and distributed certain medicines under a specific trademark.109 
The mortgagee, Morgan, made a very large loan in the amount of $48,500 to
Miller & Sons in 1875.110  He executed a chattel mortgage to secure the debt, took
possession of the property under the mortgage through agency, and operated
Miller & Sons’ business of the manufacture and sale of medicines.111  Two years
later, Miller & Sons granted the defendant, Rogers, the exclusive rights to use the
same trademarks to sell their medicinal compounds.112  The mortgagee brought
a suit to enjoin the defendant’s use of the trademarks.113
The court addressed whether the mortgagee had a mortgage in Miller & Sons’
trademarks.114  The pertinent provision in the chattel mortgage provided: 
The following articles of personal property, now in our possession, and
now in and upon the premises known and designated as numbers (8)
eight and (12) twelve High street, in said city of Providence, viz.:  The
entire property, stock, furniture, and fixtures, and other articles, now in
and upon said premises, together with all debts and book accounts,
assets, and effects of every kind and nature, belonging to said firm of J.

106. Id. at 888 (“[A] further and conclusive reason for holding that the instrument does not
cover the good will and trade-marks is that they are not property which can be owned in gross. 
They arise out of a particular business, and do not exist apart from that business. . . . As the
mortgage in question does not pretend to cover the company’s business and franchises, it confers
no lien whatever upon the good will and trade-marks.  If the company could not have sold its good
will and trade-marks apart from its business, it evidently could not mortgage them.”).

Miller & Sons.115
The court found that the language was broad in its terms and covered the
trademarks in the mortgage grant.116  Given that the loan was large in value at the
time of the conveyance, the court stated there was no reason that Miller & Sons’
entire property was not inclusive of the trademarks for security purposes.117 
Moreover, although trademarks were “an abstract right” and could not be sold
apart from the associated business, trademarks may be bought and sold like other
property  if  the  underlying  business  was  included.118    Here,  the  mortgagee
succeeded to all of the rights in Miller & Sons’ business, took possession of the
business through agency, and gained rights to “use the trade-marks, and to
manufacture and sell the medicinal compounds.”119  Therefore, the court declared
that “[t]o hold that the trade-mark is not included in this mortgage, is to say the
most valuable part of the partnership property is not covered by the words assets
and effects of every kind and nature.”120
Because the mortgagee would only turn over the property to Miller & Sons
after they had fulfilled their obligation, the mortgage “cannot operate to divest
[the mortgagee] of the exclusive right to the trade-marks if they had acquired such
under the mortgage.”121  Accordingly, only the mortgagee had the exclusive right
to the trademarks and the defendant had no right to use them.122
The Morgan decision demonstrated that a typical trademark mortgage at that
time required the mortgagee’s possession of the mortgagor’s entire business
associated with the trademark.123  The mortgagee employed an agent to succeed
to  the  mortgagor’s  business.124    There  was  no  recording  of  the  trademark
mortgage.125  Consequently, unlike patents, trademarks could not be easily
mortgaged because the mortgagor must transfer the associated business to the
mortgagee as part of the transaction, and the mortgagee must then take possession
of the mortgagor’s business.126

In this respect it differs from a patent or a copyright.  But in connection with the article produced,
it may be bought and sold like other property.  It constitutes a part of partnership assets, and is
properly sold with the firm property.”).

Moreover, while both patent and copyright statutory provisions explicitly
allowed patents127 and copyrights128 to be used in chattel mortgages, the trademark
statute did not include a similar provision.129  Trademarks themselves, apart from
the associated business, were excluded from mortgages.130
The rationale for the exclusion was due to the strong belief that a trademark
cannot be transferred in gross without the associated business.131  For example,
in Mendes v. New England Duplicating Co., the plaintiff, owner of the Paddy
Company, had developed the Paddy mark in connection with the manufacturing
and  selling  of  collating  machines.132    The  plaintiff  brought  a  trademark
infringement claim against New England Duplicating Co. for the use of the Paddy
mark in advertisements in trade periodicals.133  The defendant asserted that it had
the right to use the mark, relying on the mortgage on all of the Paddy Company’s
assets, trademarks, and goodwill as the basis of its authority to use the Paddy
trademark.134  Specifically, the defendant had entered into an agreement with a
third party, Herbits, for the distribution and advertisement of collating machines
to be produced by Herbits under the Paddy mark.135  “[Herbits] purported to have
the right to use the Paddy name by virtue of a chattel mortgage executed by
[Paddy]  on  all  its  assets  and  goodwill.”136    The  district  court  stated  that
trademarks and goodwill are “species of property [that] cannot be owned in gross
and therefore cannot be sold or transferred apart from the franchise and the
business  of  the  company.”137    Therefore,  the  mortgage  on  the  trademarks
themselves was held invalid.138
The court in Mendes strictly followed an earlier case, In re Leslie-Judge Co.,
decided by the Second Circuit in 1921.139  The relevant provision for property
127. 35 U.S.C. § 261 (2014) (“[A]n assignment, grant, or conveyance shall be void as against
any subsequent purchaser or mortgagee for a valuable consideration, without notice, unless it is
recorded in the Patent and Trademark Office within three months from its date or prior to the date
of such subsequent purchase or mortgage.”).

covered by the mortgage transaction in that case stated:  
All goods and chattels wherever situated, including plant, machinery,
equipment, supplies of all kinds, furniture, and all personal and other
property, property rights, good will, copyrights, trade-marks, and choses

right,  title,  interest,  property,  possession,  income,  and  demand
whatsoever, as well in law as in equity of the company, to have and to
hold the same and every part thereof.140
The mortgagor later filed for bankruptcy.141  The district court ordered the bank’s
property to be sold free of the mortgage that the mortgagor company had signed
on August 1, 1909, to the Title Guarantee & Trust Company to secure an amount
of $700,000.142  The Second Circuit affirmed the district court’s decision because
mortgages on trademarks were not permissible due to the fact that trademarks
“are not property which can be owned in gross,” as “[t]hey arise out of a
particular business, and do not exist apart from that business.”143  Therefore, “[i]f
the company could not have sold its good will and trade-marks apart from its
business, it evidently could not mortgage them.”144 
The early prohibition of trademark mortgages began to dissipate as courts
adopted a modern view of goodwill and allowed transfers and assignments of
trademarks apart from the business.145  For example, in Glamorene Products
Corp. v. Procter & Gamble Co., Stauffer Chemical Company assigned the mark
“BOUNCE” for dry-cleaning detergent to Procter & Gamble.146  The grant recited
that the assignment was together with the goodwill of the business.147  There was
no transfer of the associated business as Stauffer continued to operate and retain
the tangible assets of the business.148  Upon receiving the assignment, Procter &
Gamble used the mark on its own dry-cleaning detergent.149  The court found the
assignment valid; the trademarks along with attached goodwill can be assigned

II.  MOVING FROM IP MORTGAGE TO SECURED TRANSACTIONS
From the end of World War II to 1970, the United States experienced
significant economic growth.152  Not surprisingly, the nation also embarked on
major changes in the law in order to facilitate the postwar boom.153  The Uniform
Commercial Code was promulgated in 1952 in an effort to bring uniformity to
commercial law across the states and to facilitate and increase daily transactions
in commerce.154  In 1962, with the promulgation of the Official Text of Article 9
of the Uniform Commercial Code (“UCC-9”), modern financing law was born.155 
Article 9 eliminated antiquated distinctions among security devices, including
mortgages, pledges, conditional sales, factor, warehousing and others, with a

151. Id. at 895-96 (stating that “transfer of tangible assets (inventory, labels, customer lists,
formulas, etc.) is not necessary to an effective trademark assignment”) (citing Sterling Brewers, Inc.

F.2d 947 (C.C.P.A. 1962)).  Moreover, the liberal trends relating to trademark assignments without
the transfer of tangible assets spill over to the area of trademark licensing.  Xuan-Thao Nguyen,
Bankrupting Trademarks, 37 U.C. DAVIS L. REV. 1267, 1281 (2004) (stating that courts have

MONEY DYNASTIES 274-85 (2002) (describing the economic growth in the 1950s and 1960s).  The
economic growth in the post-war years also impacted real estate transactions, as more people
moved to suburban houses.  See Nicole Stelle Garnett, Suburbs as Exits, Suburbs as Entrance, 106
MICH. L. REV. 277, 282 (2007) (stating that the “postwar economic boom enabled more people than
ever before to choose a suburban life”).

161, 181 (1992) (stating that the “postwar economic boom and the resulting economic and legal
expansion led to dramatic changes in the scale of markets, industries, commerce, and economic
relations. These increased the market for legal work as did the growth of welfare states, their
subsequent expansion of legislation, and the need for legal services”).

unitary system of secured transaction law.156  The unitary system covers all
transactions, regardless of form, that create security interests in personal property
(that is, property other than real estate).157  Prior to the adoption of UCC-9, there
was no single body of law that governed liens in personal property.158  Each state
had its own statutes and common law doctrines governing liens.159  There was no
uniformity across the United States.160  Article 9’s unitary system has been an
enormous success and a crowning achievement for the National Conference of
Commissioners on Uniform State Laws (“NCCUSL”) as all states have adopted
it.161
The success of UCC-9 meant a reduction in transaction costs caused by
overlapping, opaque, and confusing security devices.162  The success of the law
meant the proliferation of secured transactions in the United States.163  It also
meant an increase in financing using all different types of intellectual property,
including patents, copyrights and trademarks—increasingly valuable assets for
a  company  in  modern  time.164    Consequently,  gone  was  the  conditional

assignment of patents and copyrights.165  The cumbersome practices discussed in
Waterman v. Mackenzie were no longer necessary;166 the secured party or lender
need not demand assignments of patents or copyrights upfront with subsequent
return of the patents or copyrights to the borrower upon satisfaction of the
payment obligations.167  Likewise, the practice of appointing an agent to take over
the possession of the borrower’s business for purposes of trademark mortgages
became impractical and unnecessary.168  Under modern UCC-9 law, the borrower
or debtor continues to own and use the intellectual or other personal property for
the business operation.169  In doing so, the debtor would be able to make
payments to the secured party.170  There was no need for the secured party to have
assignment either directly or via an agent.171  UCC-9 law protects the secured
party’s interest without the antiquated, cumbersome practices.172
During a period of major change in state commercial law across the nation,
Congress overhauled trademark law in 1946, patent law in 1952, and copyright
law in 1976.173  These historic milestones brought intellectual property law to
modern time, recognizing the significant role of intellectual property in the
economy. 
Soon, modern UCC-9 law intersected with modern intellectual property law,
raising new questions that required courts to address intellectual property issues

of state law, questions arose related to the manner to perfect the security interests
in patents, copyrights and trademarks as collateral.175  Specifically, the question
arose as to whether federal or state recording regimes would be applicable to
govern security interests in intellectual property.176  These questions have direct
impact on the secured party’s rights against other secured parties, lenders, and
third parties.177  How courts addressed these questions would either encourage or
hinder access to credit for businesses and individuals with intellectual property
as collateral. 
A.  A New Approach to Perfection of Patents Collateral
In Waterman v. Mackenzie, the United States Supreme Court enunciated that
patent conditional assignments or mortgages recorded with the Patent Office have
the equivalent of possession of the patents.178  The practice to protect security
interests  in  patents  at  that  time  was  to  file  the  conditional  assignment  or
mortgages with the Patent Office.179  Financing practices, however, have changed
substantially in modern time.
In modern time, the grant of a security interest in personal property, including
patents, is understood as not an outright transfer of ownership in the property.180 
Secured  financing  no  longer  requires  title  or  ownership  of  the  collateral
property.181  Indeed, Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code comment to
section 9-101 provides:
This article does not determine whether “title” to the collateral is in the
secured party or in the debtor and adopts neither a “title theory” nor a
“lien theory” of security interests.  Rights, obligations and remedies
under the Article do not depend on a location of title.182
Several courts, which understood that the functional approach to modern
financing law was that the grant of a security interest would not effectuate a
transfer of present ownership in the patent, held that such a grant is not required
to be recorded with the Patent Office.183  The Patent Office’s filing system is for
to use a patent or trademark to secure a loan.  The extent to which each body of law is applicable
and the interaction between the two systems was left unclear by the drafters of Article 9 and has
not been clarified by Congress.  The radical differences between the state and federal systems, both
conceptually and as implemented, further complicate the uncertainty in the law.”).

assignments or transfer of titles.184
For example, in City Bank & Trust Co. v. Otto Fabric, Inc., the bank
provided loans to Otto Fabric and received a security interest in “all contract
rights, receivables and general intangibles” in 1983.185  The bank immediately
filed a financing statement with the Secretary of State in Kansas.186  Two years
later Otto Fabric and the bank signed a new security agreement wherein the
debtor provided to the bank security interest in several assets, including three
patents.187  As part of the secured transaction, the debtor promised to assign the
patents for collateral purposes.188  The bank recorded the financing statement with
the Secretary of State in Kansas in early January 1985 and filed the patent
assignments with the Patent Office a few days later.189  In April 1985, the debtor
filed for bankruptcy, and the trustee sought to set aside the bank’s security
interest in the patents because the assignment was filed outside the ninety day
preference period.190  The bankruptcy court granted the bank relief on the other
assets, except the three patents serving as collateral, because the bank timely
perfected the security interest in the other assets within the ninety day preference
period.191  The bank appealed.192
The district court reversed the bankruptcy court’s decision.193  The court
noted that the relevant federal patent statutory provision does not completely
preempt the recording of a security interest in patents.194  Specifically, the statute
does not expressly require the filing of an assignment with the Patent and
Trademark Office in order to perfect a security interest in patents.195  Also, the
court observed Congress has amended patent law numerous times “since the
advent of modern commercial law” but chose not to completely preempt the field
of filing.196 
Most importantly, the Court observed that if the filing requirement with the
Patent Office exists, “which is considered an absolute assignment,” it would

reduce the financing with patents as collateral.197    For example, the court
provided, “a patentee or his assigns could not grant a license after using the patent
as collateral for a loan if the secured lender filed the security agreement with the
Patent Office.”198  The only way for the patentee to be able to license to others is
to request permission from the lender.199  Also, without the rights to the patent
after the assignment, the only way the patentee could bring a lawsuit is to join the
lender as an indispensable party.200  In summary, the court asserted that the desire
to impose a rule for a federal, central filing system of patent collateral will not be
rational, convenient, or consistent with modern financing and Article 9 of the
Uniform Commercial Code.201  That means the single, federal system will
diminish financing with patents as collateral.202  Therefore, City Bank & Trust
Co. indeed had perfected its security interest in the patents within the ninety days
preference, like the other collateral in the transaction.203
B.  New Approaches to Copyright Collateral
The growth in the entertainment and software industries spurred financing for
the creation and distribution of new content.204  A number of court cases focused
on the perfection of security interests in copyrights of films in these industries,
forcing a close examination of whether federal law or state law governs when the
secured creditors file the security interest in copyrights.205  The filing question is
significantly important.206  Filing in the wrong office renders the security interest

unperfected, losing priority to other creditors.207  In other words, the secured
creditor without proper perfection cannot recover on the money loaned to the
borrower; other creditors would get paid first from the pool that is already small
due to the borrower’s dire financial condition.208
A line of court decisions on perfection of copyright collateral began with the
controversial decision In re Peregrine Entertainment, Ltd.209  In that case,
National Peregrine, Inc. (“NPI”) filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 11 in 1989.210 
Prior to the bankruptcy filing, NPI was in the entertainment industry, developing
and distributing television programs.211  NPI’s principal assets consisted primarily
of copyrights, distribution rights and licenses of films, and account receivables
arising from the licensing of the films.212   To obtain financing for its business,
NPI’s predecessor by merger entered into a credit line agreement with Capitol
Federal Savings and Loan Association of Denver (“Cap Fed”) for $6,000,000 in
June 1985.213  The credit was secured by NPI’s assets, including “[a]ll inventory
consisting of films and all accounts, contract rights, chattel paper, general
intangibles, instruments, equipment, and documents related to such inventory,
now owned or hereafter acquired by the Debtor.”214 
Cap Fed filed its UCC-1 financing statement in California, Colorado, and
Utah to perfect its security interest in NPI’s assets.215  It did not file with the
United States Copyright Office with respect to the copyrights.216 
As debtor-in-possession under Chapter 11, NPI filed a complaint against Cap
Fed, asserting that the bank failed to file its security interest in the copyrights and
the account receivables generated by the licensing and distribution of the films
with the Copyright Office.217  Due to the bank’s lack of perfection of the security
interest, NPI claimed that it enjoyed a judicial lien on the copyrights and account
receivables thereunder.218  The bankruptcy court held for Cap Fed, and NPI
appealed to the district court.219  Kozinski, Circuit Judge, sitting by designation,
reversed.220  The judge cited to the federal copyright policy for a central, uniform
system of recording security interests in copyrights and held that Cap Fed’s filing

in the states’ offices failed to provide notice to third parties.221  Accordingly, NPI,
as debtor-in-possession, avoided Cap Fed’s unperfected security interest.222 
The National Peregrine decision was controversial because the security
interest in that case included intangibles related to copyrights, which both
commentators and courts called into doubt.223  Subsequent decisions, however,
narrowed and modified the National Peregrine holding.224
The court in National Peregrine did not distinguish between registered
copyrights and unregistered copyrights.225  The majority of copyrights are not
registered with the United States Copyright Office.226  That does not mean that the
unregistered  copyrights  are  not  protected  under  federal  copyright  law.227 
Copyright  protections  begin  at  the  time  of  completion,  regardless  of
registration,228 and it is not practical to require authors to register all works of
authorship.229  Consequently, copyright owners do not feel the need to register
their copyrights, as they are still able to exploit their copyrights and use them as
collateral in secured transactions.230

Bank and signed a security agreement to secure the loan.231  The security
agreement  granted  the  bank  a  security  interest  in  copyrights  embodied  in
drawings, blueprints, and computer software.232  The debtors did not register their
copyrights with the Copyright Office.233  The bank then filed a UCC-1 financing
statement with the Secretary of State of California where the debtors were
located.234  Thereafter, the debtors filed for bankruptcy, and the bankruptcy court
approved the trustee’s sale of the bankruptcy estate’s assets, including the
copyrights  and  the  trustee’s  avoidance  power  to  Aerocon  Engineering.235 
Aerocon brought an action against the bank, seeking to avoid the security interest
of the bank in the copyrights.236  The bankruptcy court ruled for the bank.237 
Aerocon appealed to the Ninth Circuit.238
The Ninth Circuit distinguished National Peregrine239 and rejected two other
lower court’s decisions that had extended National Peregrine’s holding to
perfection of security interest in unregistered copyrights240 for several reasons.241 
National Peregrine and subsequent decisions concerned only the manner of
perfection of security interest in copyrights; they did not address unregistered
copyrights.242  Also, the Copyright Office’s recordation system is only for
registered copyrights; none is available for unregistered copyrights.243  Moreover,
the Copyright Act contains no express provision prohibiting a secured party from
perfecting its security interest in unregistered copyrights under the state law
system.244  Therefore, the court held that there was no federal preemption of
perfection of security interests in unregistered copyrights.245  
Consequently, if a copyright is registered, the recording of a security interest
in the registered copyright is with the Copyright Office.246  If the copyright is
unregistered, UCC-9 filing system applies.247  Most importantly, the court warned

copyrights, “no lender would lend against unregistered copyrights if they couldn’t
perfect  their  security  interest.”248    Unregistered  copyrights  “have  value  as
collateral,” but without a system to perfect their security interest “they would
have no value at all.”249 
The Ninth Circuit also noted that the boom in the software industry means
that more copyrights in software will be used as collateral and after-acquired
collateral in secured transactions.250  Imposing the burden of registration for
copyrights before they can be used as collateral in financing would cause a heavy
burden on software developers:
If software developers had to register copyrights in their software before
using it as collateral, the last half hour of the day for a software company
would be spent preparing and mailing utterly pointless forms to the
Copyright Office to register and record security interests.  Our reading
of the law “promote[s] the Progress of Science and useful Arts” by
preserving the collateral value of unregistered copyrights, which is to
say, the vast majority of copyrights.251
Accordingly, the court affirmed the lower court’s decision in favor of Silicon
Valley Bank.252
In summary, the cases discussed above allow both registered and unregistered
copyrights to serve as collateral in financing.253  The courts recognized the growth
in a new medium of copyrights, particularly software copyrights, and refined its
approaches to ensure the ease of financing for both existing and new creative
content industries.254
C.  A New Approach to Trademarks Collateral
Modern commercial law, especially Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial

structure for secured transactions in order to encourage secured financing across
the United States, has an impact on the use of trademarks as collateral in
financing.255  Also, as courts adopted modern trends in permitting the assignments
of trademarks without the underlying business, trademarks can be transferred
separately.256  These new developments opened the door for trademarks to be

used as collateral in financing.257  Soon, cases involving security interests in
trademarks reached the court.258
The first case that addressed the perfection of trademark collateral was In re
Roman Cleanser Co.259  The Roman Cleanser Company, a Michigan corporation,
was in the business of manufacturing, packaging and marketing household
cleaning products under the trademark “Roman” and other marks.260  All of the
marks were federally registered.261  Roman then filed for bankruptcy.262  The
bankruptcy  trustee  sold  the  federally  registered  trademarks,  formulas,  and
customer lists to Michlin Chemical Corporation for $180,000.263  After the sale,
National  Acceptance  Company  of  America  (“NAC”)  sought  to  intervene,
claiming that it had senior, perfected security interest in the trademarks.264  The
facts revealed that a few years before bankruptcy, Roman granted NAC a security
interest “in and to all of Roman Cleanser’s then owned and thereafter acquired
goods, equipment, and general intangibles and the proceeds thereof as collateral
for the payment of all indebtedness and liabilities then existing or thereafter
arising of Roman Cleanser to NAC.”265  This grant was part of a loan and security
agreement.266    NAC  timely  filed  a  financing  statement  with  the  Michigan
Secretary of State.267  The trustee opposed on the ground that NAC did not file a
conditional assignment of the federally registered trademark with the United
States  Patent  and  Trademark  Office  and  that  NAC’s  security  interest  was
therefore unperfected.268
The  bankruptcy  court  held  for  NAC.269    The  court  distinguished  an
assignment from a security interest of a trademark.270  On the one hand, an
assignment means absolute transfer of all right, title and interest to the trademark,
whereas a security interest is not.271  Indeed, on the other hand, a security interest
is “merely what the term suggests—a device to secure an indebtedness . . . [i]t is
a  mere  agreement  to  assign  in  the  event  of  a  default  by  the  debtor.”272

Consequently, a promise to assign a trademark is not an absolute transfer of the
trademark covered by the federal trademark law.273  Federal trademark law
governs the transfers of trademarks and requires filing such transfers.274  State
law, not federal trademark law, governs the manner of perfecting a security
interest in trademarks.275  
In the original bankruptcy proceedings, the court also noted that if Congress
intended to provide “a means for recording security interests in trademarks in
addition to assignments, it would have been simple to so state.”276  Moreover, the
court reasoned that a federal, central filing for all security interests in trademarks
would  not  further  Congress’  concern  in  passing  the  federal  Lanham  Act
trademark law for protecting the public from the deceptive use of trademarks
because a secured creditor with only a security interest in the trademark collateral
does not have the right to use the trademark absent debtor default on the loan.277 
The Sixth Circuit subsequently affirmed the lower court’s decision.278 
Subsequent cases have adopted both “the logic and holding” of the Roman
Cleanser court.279  Some courts offered strong public policy reasons for how a
federal filing system under the Lanham Act for security interests in trademarks
would not encourage financing.280
III.  U.S. SMALL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION AND IP MORTGAGES
Following the Waterman v. Mackenzie281 decision, intellectual property
mortgages began to flourish, which was evidenced by the fact that not only
private creditors, but the United States Small Business Administration (“SBA”)
provided loans secured by intellectual property.282  In 1953, Congress passed the
Small Business Act to create SBA whose function was to “aid, counsel, assist and
protect, insofar as is possible, the interest of small business concerns.”283   SBA

provides loans, loan guarantees, and counseling to small businesses across the
countries.284  Railex Corp. v. Joseph Guss & Sons, Inc. is an illustrative example
of lending to small businesses and taking intellectual property assets, including
patent applications, as security.285  
On November 21, 1961, Railex borrowed money from SBA and signed a
document wherein it transferred title of the patent applications to the SBA.286  The
document provided that the assignment would be null and void if Railex fulfilled
its payment obligations pursuant to the promissory note.287  The note was due to
mature on November 21, 1971.288  Railex, however, repaid the loan in full on July
31, 1964.289  On August 21, 1964, Railex brought a patent infringement suit
against Joseph Guss & Sons, Inc.290  The defendants sought to dismiss the suit,
arguing that SBA was the indispensable party to the suit.291 
The court observed that the conditional assignment of the patent applications
for security of the note was a mortgage transaction similar to the patent mortgage
transaction in the Waterman v. Mackenzie case.292  The court recognized that
under Waterman, the mortgagee holding a patent enjoys the entire title, both
equitable title and legal title, to the patent collateral and can bring an infringement
suit against others.293  The court, however, distinguished its facts from Waterman,
noting that the mortgagor in Waterman did not repay the loan at the time it filed
the patent infringement suit, whereas the mortgagor in the present case, Railex,
had paid the loan in full prior to filing the patent infringement law suit.294  
Consequently, Railex reacquired equitable title to the mortgaged patents on

July 31, 1964, when the loan from the SBA was repaid in full.295  SBA continued
to hold the bare legal title in the mortgaged patents until April 26, 1965.296   SBA
held the bare legal title after Railex paid off the loan and before the total release
of the “assignment” pursuant to the instrument, “as constructive trustee for the
benefit of plaintiff-mortgagor, but no longer as security for the SBA loan, which
had been repaid in full on July 31, 1964.”297   Therefore, Railex had standing to
bring the infringement suit against the defendants and SBA, “as holder of bare
legal title to the patents in suit” as of the complaint filing date, “is neither an
indispensable nor a necessary party in the present” patent infringement suit “in
the nature of a suit in equity.”298
This case is important on several fronts.  It shows that small businesses are
in need of financing.299  Access to credit is crucial to the survival of the
business.300  It demonstrates that small businesses do not have the real estate
property for security of loans.301  What small businesses do have is intellectual
property.302  When making loans to small businesses, SBA and private lending
institutions recognize this reality and take intellectual property, including patent
applications, as security for loans.303  In addition, this case follows Waterman v.
Mackenzie to vest the intellectual property mortgagee with the entire title in the
mortgaged intellectual property during the time the intellectual property serves

as security for the outstanding loan.304  In other words, the ruling in this case
encourages financing secured by intellectual property assets.305
IV.  SECURED PARTY OF IP COLLATERAL AS OWNER BY OPERATION OF LAW
Modern secured transactions law specifies what the secured party’s rights are
in the event the debtor fails to fulfill payment obligation or is in default.306  The
secured party can foreclose on the collateral and dispose of the collateral for
purposes of recovering as much as it can on the loan.307  With tangible collateral,
the secured party can enter the debtor’s premise and seize the collateral as long
as the repossession is conducted without breaching the peace.308  Alternatively,
the secured party can obtain a judicial order to repossess the collateral, but this
process is both costly and inefficient.309  Upon having the possession of the
collateral, the secured party can conduct either a public or private sale of the
collateral.310    With  intellectual  property  collateral,  foreclosure  has  its  own
challenges.311  Repossession with the self-help method for tangible property
cannot be applied to intellectual property as they are intangible in nature.312  The
question, then, is must the secured party request that the debtor execute an
assignment of the foreclosed intellectual property to the secured party and record
the assignment with the Patent Office before the secured party can transfer the
intellectual property to a purchaser?  What should the law be in addressing the
above challenge in order to encourage financing with intellectual property as
collateral?

development  of  the  intellectual  property  secured  financing  law.313    In Sky
Technologies, Ozro, Inc. owned a portfolio of patents and sought financing from
Silicon Valley Bank (“SVB”).314  On April 1, 2001, Ozro executed an Intellectual
Property Security Agreement with SVB, granting the bank a “security interest in
all of Grantor’s right, title, and interest, whether presently existing or hereafter
acquired in, to and under all of the Collateral.”315  The collateral included the
patent portfolio, and SVB filed the agreement with the United States Patent and
Trademark Office on the same day.316  
On the next day, Ozro signed a similar security agreement with Cross
Atlantic Capital Partners, Inc. (“XACP”).317  The security agreement contained
identical provisions as the agreement between Ozro and SVB.318  In both
agreements, Ozro used the patent portfolio as collateral to secure the loans.319  In
the event of default by Ozro on the loans, both SVB and XACP have “the right
to exercise all the remedies of a secured party upon such default under the
Massachusetts UCC,” including the right to repossess and dispose the intellectual
property collateral.320  In addition, Ozro was required to “assemble the Intellectual
Property Collateral and any tangible property in which [SVB or XACP] has a
security interest and to make it available to [SVB or XACP].”321 
A year and a half later, in December 2002, SVB assigned its security interest
under  the  SVB  Agreement  with  Ozro  to  XACP  through  a  non-recourse
assignment, giving XACP all of the “right, title, and interest” formerly held by
SVB.322  XACP recorded the assignment with the United States Patent and
Trademark Office.323  XACP still held its own existing security interest in Ozro’s
patent portfolio collateral.324
A few months later, Ozro defaulted on the loan, and XACP foreclosed on the
assets, including the patents.325  On July 14, 2003, upon foreclosure and after
notifying all parties with interest in the patents, XACP sold the patents at public

the patents.327   During the foreclosure and disposition process, Ozro never
executed a written agreement assigning all of its rights, title or interests in the
assets, including the patents to XACP.328  Subsequently, XACP assigned the
patents to Sky Technologies.329  Three years later, in 2006, Sky Technologies
brought a patent infringement suit against SAP who then moved to dismiss the
suit, asserting that Sky Technologies had no standing because Ozro had never
assigned its rights in the patents to XACP.330  
The district court held for Sky Technologies and granted SAP’s Motion for
Certification of Question for Interlocutory Appeal to the Federal Circuit based on
a finding that “substantial grounds for difference of opinion exist regarding the
question of whether a transfer of title through operation of law without a written
assignment may apply in situations that do not involve heirs or probate law.”331
The Federal Circuit emphasized that the central question was whether XACP
had right, title, and interest in the patents to transfer all of those rights to Sky
Technologies.332  The court looked to Massachusetts UCC Article 9 to determine
XACP’s  ownership  in  the  patents.333    The  court  determined  that  under
Massachusetts UCC section 9-610, XACP, as a secured party, had the right to
dispose of the collateral in a commercially reasonable manner after the debtor,
Ozro, was in default.334  XACP was allowed under Article 9 to purchase the
collateral at a public disposition.335  Further, under UCC section 9-617, upon
acquiring the collateral at the disposition, the transferee for value takes all of the
debtor’s rights in the collateral.336  Accordingly, “[b]ecause XACP foreclosed on
the patents-in-suit in conformity with these provisions, XACP obtained title to the
patents on July 14, 2003.”337  XACP became the new owner of the patents as
“[n]othing in the language of [Article 9] evinces the requirement that a writing
must exist to transfer patent rights through operation of law,” and it properly
transferred its ownership to Sky Technologies.338  The Federal Circuit affirmed
the district court’s decision that Sky Technologies had indeed become the new
owner of the patents through operation of law.339

patent ownership through operation of law (i.e., foreclosure, disposition, and
purchase  of  patents  under  UCC  Article  9)  without  the  parties  having  to
memorialize the transaction in writing.340  Notably, the writing requirement would
negatively impact existing secured financing with patents as collateral, hinder
future financing with patent collateral, and impose burden on transactions:
First, if foreclosure on security interests secured by patent collateral
could not transfer ownership to the secured creditor, a large number of
patent titles presently subject to security interests may be invalidated. 
Any secured creditor who maintained an interest in patent collateral
would be in danger of losing its rights in such collateral.  Second, by
restricting transfer of patent ownership only to assignments, the value of
patents could significantly diminish because patent owners would be
limited in their ability to use patents as collateral or pledged security. 
Lastly, it would be impractical to require secured parties to seek out
written assignments following foreclosure from businesses that may have
ceased to exist.341
The Federal Circuit’s legal and public policy explanations mark an important
development in the law relating to financing with the use of intellectual property
as collateral.342  With certainty, a secured party now can expect that in the event
the debtor is in default, the secured party can become the owner of the intellectual
property collateral by operation of law as long as the secured party properly
disposes and purchases the collateral in accordance with Article 9 of the Uniform
Commercial Code.343  The secured party’s ownership of the intellectual property
by operation of law reduces unnecessary costs in searching and demanding for the
debtor’s signature.344  The recognition also enhances the value of the intellectual
property because the purchaser can trust that the chain of title of the intellectual
property has not been broken.345  The purchaser is the new owner, as it has bought
from the secured party with ownership of the intellectual property by operation
of law.346  In summary, Sky Technologies v. SAP recognizes the importance of
secured transactions today with intellectual property collateral and adheres to the
purposes of UCC Article 9 in encouraging secured financing.347

V.  SECURED PARTY’S RISKS RELATED TO IP COLLATERAL
Providing financing to businesses involving intellectual property assets does
present some risks to secured creditors.348  As intellectual property assets have
become increasingly valuable corporate assets, many companies aggressively
assert infringement against third parties.349  The cost of infringement litigation is
high and a disruptive threat to the operation of the business.350  From the secured
creditor’s perspective, in addition to the risk of nonperforming loans and the
difficulty of obtaining an accurate valuation of intellectual property assets, there
are at least two additional types of risks:  (1) whether a grant of a security interest
in some circumstances can be deemed a fraudulent transfer; and (2) whether the
secured creditor is liable for infringement.351
A.  Fraudulent Transfers
Aptix Corp. v. Quickturn Design Systems, Inc. is a cautionary tale for all
investors who pour their own financial resources to finance their own startups and
take a security interest in the startup’s intellectual property.352  Dr. Amr Mohsen
developed hardware-logic-emulation technology and was the inventor of certain
patents.353  Dr. Mohsen founded the company, Aptix, and was the majority
shareholder, chief executive officer, and chairman of the company.354  Like many
other startups, the company was in financial trouble due to unsuccessful attempts
to borrow money, raise equity financing from outside investors, and merge with
another company.355  Dr. Mohsen used his own financial resources to make at
least $2 million in loans to the company.356  These loans were unsecured; they did
‘441 patent were included in the foreclosure sale”).

September 2003 to the company.358  These loans were secured by the company’s

sought to levy against the company’s assets that had already been encumbered to
Dr. Mohsen’s security interest.362
However, the Federal Circuit’s majority panel held that “the making of a
secured loan instead of an unsecured loan in anticipation of an adverse judgment
establishes deliberate wrongful conduct” and concluded that Dr. Mohsen’s
security interest in the patents was a fraudulent transfer by the company.363  The
majority panel affirmed the district court’s decision to void Dr. Mohsen’s security
interest in the patents.364  
Whether one agrees with the panel’s majority is not material here. What is
important is accessing potential risks to the secured party.  As seen in this case,
routine business financing can be disregarded and labeled as a fraudulent transfer
to the detriment of the lenders.365  In providing financial resources to a startup, an
investor-as-secured-creditor must be aware of how courts view the investor’s
conduct in determining whether the financing with intellectual property used as
collateral is legitimate.366
B.  Infringement Liability
Another type of risk is infringement liability.367  This risk occurs if the
secured lender extends credit to a borrower, takes a security interest in the
borrower’s property and assets, and then forecloses on collateral, which includes
products that are the subject of a patent infringement suit asserted by the patentee

against others, including the borrower.368  The question arises whether the secured
creditor  is  liable  for  infringement,  either  under  the  direct  infringement  or
contributory infringement theory.369  
Van Well Nursery, Inc. v. Mony Life Insurance Co. illustrates a secured
creditor’s potential patent infringement liability risk.370  Van Well owned a
particular patent for a new apple tree variety and sold the patented trees to the
public.371  On July, 9, 2004, Van Well brought a patent infringement action
against A/B Hop Farm and Mony Life Insurance (“Mony Life”).372  Mony Life
had periodically made large loans to A/B Hop Farm from 1991 to 1996.373  In
February, 1996, Mony Life loaned $2.5 million to A/B Hop Farm for the
purchase of Wallula Orchard Properties and the loan was secured by the Wallula
Orchard Properties.374  The parties signed the mortgage agreement.375  Thereafter,
A/B Hop Farms defaulted on the loan and Mony Life foreclosed on all property
collateral, including Wallula Orchard Properties.376
Van Well asserted that because Wallula Orchard Properties had planted apple
trees that infringed on the patent at issue, Mony Life was liable based on the
mortgage document between A/B Hop Farm and Mony Life.377  Van Well relied
on certain provisions in the mortgage document to advance its infringement
theory against Mony Life.378  Specifically, the mortgage agreement provided that
the mortgagor, in order to secure the payment of the $2.5 million dollar loan,
“mortgages, assigns and warrants” to the mortgage lender, Mony Life, the
Wallula land 
together  with  numerous  other  interests  including  for  example  the
buildings, improvements, fixtures, permanent plantings, crops and other
farm products, rents, profits, income and proceeds therefrom, contract
rights, water rights, all judgments, awards of damages, settlements and
payments made for any taking of the property or damage to the property,
and a security interest in all irrigation, frost control and orchard cooling
facilities.379
The mortgage agreement also stated that the conveyances would be null and void,
but only if the mortgagor made all payment obligations and performed all

covenants in the agreement.380  In the event that the mortgage was in default, the
mortgage agreement provided Mony Life with recourse to protect its security
interests in the property.381  Mony Life countered that these provisions were
“standard” in agricultural secured lending business.382
The court analyzed the direct infringement claim after it quickly disposed the
contributory infringement claim for lack of evidence.383  The court first noted that
Van Well raised an issue of first impression of a mortgage lender’s liability for
patent infringement.384  This issue required an examination of whether the
mortgage lender’s conduct falls within “use” of the patent.385 
The inquiry on “use” of the patent is a factual inquiry on case-by-case
basis.386  Van Well advanced a theory of direct infringement on the part of the
mortgage lender by urging the district court to interpret the term “use” broadly
and accept the theory of “constructive use” that Mony Life “should be held liable
because it had an ability to act with respect to the infringing trees and it possessed
sufficient rights that it ‘could [have affected] the infringing activity if it so
chose.’”387  Van Well cited to a number of cases to support its argument, but the
district court rejected them because their facts were distinguishable from the case
at bar.388  Crucially, the cited cases involved actual conduct involving the
infringing  product,  actual  control  over,  and  possession  of  the  infringing
product.389  Here, the district court noted that Mony Life “did not have, nor could
have had” the infringing apple trees.390  Therefore, Mony Life could not “use” the
patent because “how could one use an item it does not have?”391   More
specifically, Mony Life could, as a secured creditor to secure the loans it made
to the borrower, “demand rights and performance of obligations in order to assure
the collateral pledged is maintained.”392  The district court observed that “[i]f
having these rights, without their actual exercise, was considered ‘use’ of the
property itself then no secure creditor would ever be protected.”393  
The court emphasized that holding a lending institution liable for direct
infringement under the facts in this case would threaten the foundation of a
dynamic, competitive, and stable economy and other threats:

[A]t  a  minimum  it  would  create  tremendous  apprehension  and
uncertainty  in  lending,  instill  additional  disincentives  to  lend  and
discourage  productive  enterprises,  and  perhaps  threaten  the  very
foundation of the agricultural lending industry and the economy it serves. 
The costs associated with defending against an intellectual property
infringement suit and any liability associated therewith could easily
exceed the amount originally at stake in the underlying transaction.394
Congress, not courts, was the appropriate body for Van Well to seek the
extension of its patent protection against mortgage lenders.395  Accordingly, Mony
Life’s authority to control Wallula Orchard property pursuant to the mortgage
agreement failed to support Van Well’s claim of direct infringement against
Mony Life.396
The court clarified that its decision was not dictated by Mony Life’s argument
that the provisions in the mortgage agreement were merely “standard” in the
agricultural secured lending business.397  The court warned that “standard” lender
behavior is “a mutable concept, and it will respond to the liability rules the Courts
and Congress put into place.”398  However, “[i]n this context, while lenders may
offer deep-pocket appeal to the patent holder, lender liability has not been met
with widespread judicial acceptance in most tort-liability scenarios.”399  
Moreover, the court rejected Van Well’s request for a declaration that Mony
Life’s security interest in any of the allegedly infringing trees in Wallula Orchard
be voided and the infringing trees ordered destroyed.400  The court denied the
request for lack of support in patent law.401  
In summary, there are two identifiable risks that a secured creditor may face
in  financing  innovation.402    First,  a  grant  of  security  interest  in  some
circumstances could be deemed as a fraudulent transfer.403  This risk can be
minimized in self-financing cases by routinely taking a security interest when the
self-financier provides a loan to his or her company.  This consistent behavior
will reduce the inference of fraudulent conveyance stemming from selective
granting and receiving security interests.  Second, the secured creditor is liable
for infringement.404  This risk is very rare in financing innovation by the private

VI. SOME IMPLICATIONS FROM HISTORICAL FINANCING INNOVATIONS
Technological advancements in the United States have profoundly changed
every sector of the economy since the United States Supreme Court decided
Waterman v. McKenzie, recognizing the use of intellectual property assets as
security in business financing.406  The loan secured by two patents in 1891
represents the quintessential American system of supporting small businesses, as
patents are major contributors to innovation and job creation.407
Along with technical advancements, not surprisingly, there are new means for
businesses today to obtain financing.408  Equity financing and crowdfunding are
two examples.409  In broad terms, in equity financing, investors will acquire
shares or equity in the business in exchange for the investment provided by the
investors to the business.410  Equity financing allows businesses to have access to
capital on a small and large scale.411  Equity financing has its shortcomings;
founders of businesses in equity financing are generally concerned about their
loss of control or direction of the company.412  Crowdfunding leverages the ease

of mobile online communication to enable businesses to present their nascent
ideas for funding from the crowd or supportive online users.413 
Despite these new methods to obtain financing, small businesses in the
United Sates have been struggling to gain access to credit.414  The recent financial
crisis and its aftermath continue to limit the ability of businesses to obtain
credit.415  Banks are still not eager to lend to small businesses, as the numbers
show a twenty percent decline in small business lending since the financial
crisis.416  Most troubling, access to credit for small businesses was already in
steady decline prior to the financial crisis.417  
A few online lenders have begun to enter the small business lending sector
and utilize technological sophistication to ration their loans to small businesses.418 
They use innovative software and data metrics from social media interactions and
Yelp comments to analyze a potential borrower’s application for a loan.419  Their
analytic system, however, ignores the borrower’s intellectual property assets.420
The lessons learned from the history of legal development for financing
innovation suggests that there is a need for both traditional and online lenders to
appreciate  the  intellectual  property  assets  held  by  small  businesses.    The
intellectual property assets should be included in the analytics in assessing the
overall health of a business seeking a loan or a line of credit.  Lenders should take
comfort in decisional laws that have consistently encouraged financing when
intellectual property assets serve as collateral.421  The long history of courts

accepting  different  types  of  intellectual  property  as  security  in  financing,
recognizing perfection of security interests in intellectual property, and elevating

CONCLUSION
Global competition is fierce.  Access to financing for small businesses and
recognition of intellectual property must be at the center of discussion of how the
United States can maintain its innovative edge.  Looking across the Pacific
Ocean, China has embraced a comprehensive strategy to increase innovation by
providing financing based on the intellectual property assets of businesses.422

Article and will be discussed in a separate article.  The central issue remains: 
how will the United States fuel its small businesses in need of financing for
innovation?
