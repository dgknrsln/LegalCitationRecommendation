I.  INTRODUCTION
NTELLECTUAL property law serves  a variety of societal goals, in-
cluding fostering  innovation  and  promoting  economic  and  cultural
development.  While vital, however,  intellectual property law  alone
cannot optimally achieve these widely shared goals.  An important issue
deserving scholarly attention concerns the proper role of the federal tax
system  in  achieving  intellectual  property  law's  innovation  objectives.
Most tax theorists would argue that an ideal tax system should seek to
minimize the social costs of taxation and avoid unnecessarily shaping eco-
nomic behavior.  But it might be decided that the tax system should de-
part from these tax principles to further innovation.  Of course, tax rules
that deliberately attempt to reward creative process and further innova-
tion must provide certainty, clarity, and dependability necessary for com-
pliance with, and sound administration of, the law.  To do that, the rules
must necessarily recognize changes in innovation and reflect the realities
of today's economy.
The Income Tax of 1913, which was adopted shortly after the ratifica-
tion of the Sixteenth Amendment, encompassed  only fourteen pages of20111 The History of Intellectual Property Taxation
statutes.1  It did not specifically  address intellectual  property and scant
administrative guidance existed on the application of traditional tax prin-
ciples to intellectual property transactions.  This was of no particular con-
sequence  at a  time  when  tangible,  physical  property  was  the  driving
engine  of commerce.
As intellectual property's role in the world economy increased so, too,
did the controversies between taxpayers and the government over the tax
implications of intellectual property transactions  (e.g.,  development, ac-
quisitions,  sales,  and licenses).  Equipped  only  with  general  tax rules,
which had theretofore  been applied only to tangible assets, courts were
increasingly  faced  with important, new questions.  For example, should
research and development costs be currently deductible under general tax
principles even though the research may not result in the development of
a  patent or  other identifiable  asset?  Should a copyright assignment  be
treated as a "sale" under general tax principles, even though payment is
in the form  of royalties?  Should  litigation costs in patent infringement
suits be treated the same for tax purposes as litigation costs in trademark
infringement  suits?  There was considerable  diversity of opinion among
the courts dealing  with  these and  other significant  tax  issues involving
intellectual property.  Sound federal tax legislation was necessary to im-
prove the clarity and consistency of tax results.
Congress did not begin enacting specific intellectual property tax rules
until the mid-twentieth century,  even though intellectual  property laws
relating to protection and enforcement had been developing since the in-
ception of the nation.  As a result of tax legislation over the past six de-
cades,  the Internal  Revenue  Code  (the Code)  contains several  specific
rules governing major transactions involving various forms of intellectual
property.  Some  of the  present  rules  are  exclusive,  governing  specific
forms  of intellectual property; others are equally applicable  to all forms
of intellectual property.  While some of the rules were designed to sup-
port intellectual property goals (i.e.,  to incentivize desirable  intellectual
property activity and promote economic growth), the vast majority of the
specific tax rules were enacted on an ad hoc basis with particular tax goals
in mind.  This Article traces the historic development of the specific tax
rules governing  intellectual property,  identifies  present areas  of policy
dissonance  in the intersection of intellectual property and taxation, and

calls for an appropriate legal framework  for future intellectual property
tax legislation.
Part II of the Article describes  how early  courts struggled to under-
stand the unique  attributes  of intellectual property  and their relevance
under general  tax  principles in resolving  intellectual property  disputes.
Because  some of  the earliest  disputes  involved  the  taxation  of patent
transactions, Part II provides several examples of early tax uncertainties
in the life cycle of a patent.
Part III identifies underlying causes of early procedural dissonance be-
tween intellectual  property and  taxation  that resulted when traditional
principles of taxation applicable  to tangible property were applied to in-
tellectual property transactions.  Specifically, Part III argues that this pro-
cedural dissonance  resulted  primarily  from three sources:  (1) difficulty
identifying when intangible intellectual property rights constituted sepa-
rable property  for tax  purposes  when competing  concepts  of  property
could yield differing tax results; (2) difficulty reconciling the substantive
similarities  and differences  among  the forms of intellectual property in
determining proper tax results and developing frameworks for future gui-
dance;  and (3) difficulty establishing, for tax purposes, the relevance  of
tangible media embodying intellectual property vis-A-vis the intangible le-
gal attributes of intellectual property.  Part III highlights the need for a
rational  set of special tax  rules to resolve uncertainties  and difficulties
that  arose  upon  the  early  intersection  of  intellectual  property  and
taxation.
Part IV  of the Article  examines  legislative responses  to early  disso-
nance between  the intellectual property regime  and historic tax princi-
ples.  In  analyzing  intellectual  property  tax  rules,  it  is  helpful  to
understand as much as possible about why they exist and how they fit into
or conflict  with the intellectual  property scheme.  To that end, Part IV
analyzes tax rules specific to intellectual property in terms of their legisla-
tive purpose and seeks to identify common goals behind special intellec-
tual  property  tax  rules.  Part  V  observes  that,  although  a  few  tax
provisions were designed to achieve important intellectualp roperty goals,
the vast majority were designed with specific tax goals in mind: to remove
tax inequities or to enhance administrative  efficiency.
The  addition  of  specific  tax  rules  governing  intellectual  property
achieved  necessary  procedural  harmonization  between  the  intellectual
property and taxation schemes.  Part V, however, shows that the resulting
tax regime may not be adequately relevant in reflecting the evolution of
technology and the reality of today's economy, such as the current inte-
gration and bundling of different types  of intellectual property in prac-
tice.  These,  and  perhaps  other,  areas  of  existing  dissonance  in  the
intersection of intellectual property and taxation need to be addressed if
the tax system is to foster the intellectual property system's  innovation2011] The History of Intellectual Property Taxation

II.  HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE: APPLYING NORMATIVE TAX
PRINCIPLES TO INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
The  term  "intellectual  property"  was  first  mentioned  in  Davoll v.
Brown, a  Massachusetts  case  decided  in  1845.3  The term  "intellectual
property"  generally  refers to patents, copyrights,  trademarks,  and trade
secrets.4  Though the term "intellectual  property" came into existence in
the nineteenth century, different types of intellectual property have been
in existence for a much longer time.5  Some have been around for several
hundred years6 and others for several thousand years.7
Early federal income tax laws did not deal specifically with intellectual
property assets even though protections for these rights had long existed.8
At the beginning of our nation, Congress had the enumerated power to
lay and collect tax.9  Early on Congress levied numerous tariffs on items

property and notes the need for harmonization between the intellectual property and taxa-
tion schemes.  For a critique of the broader intellectual  property tax regime (which in-

U.S. tax system:
To pay the debts of the Revolutionary War, Congress levied excise taxes on
distilled spirits, tobacco and snuff, refined sugar, carriages, property sold at
auctions, and various legal documents....
During the confrontation with France in the late 1790's, the Federal Govern-
ment imposed the first direct taxes on the owners of houses, land, slaves, and
estates....  When the Civil War erupted, the Congress passed the Revenue
Act of 1861, which restored earlier excises taxes and imposed a tax on per-
sonal incomes....
On July 1, 1862 the Congress passed new excise taxes on such items as play-
ing cards, gunpowder, feathers, telegrams, iron, leather, pianos, yachts, bil-
liard tables, drugs, patent medicines, and whiskey.  Many legal documents
were also taxed and license fees were collected for almost all professions and
trades....  The need for Federal revenue declined sharply after the war and
most taxes were repealed.  By 1868, the main source of Government revenue
derived from liquor  and tobacco taxes.  The income  tax was abolished in
1872.  From 1868 to 1913, almost 90 percent of allre venue was collected from
the remaining excises.

The History of Intellectual Property Taxation
These early income tax laws were void of tax rules specific to intellec-
tual property.15  This was  of no particular  consequence  at a time when
tangible, physical property was the driving engine of modern commerce.
As intellectual property  became  the dominant source  of wealth in the
world, however, the tax implications of intellectual property transactions
became more important.  Courts were  called upon to resolve numerous
controversies between taxpayers and the government over the tax conse-
quences  of intellectual property development,  acquisitions, and disposi-
tions.  Because the existing tax regime  did not specifically address these
matters, courts were forced to rely upon general tax principles in resolv-
ing tax  disputes.  Outcomes  were  diverse  as  courts struggled  to under-
stand the unique, intangible characteristics of intellectual property and to
determine their relevance under general tax rules  applicable to tangible
property.
Some of the earliest tax debates involved patent transactions. To frame
some of the issues with which courts struggled, the following example is
provided.  It highlights  tax uncertainties in the life cycle  of a patent-
development, acquisition, and disposition.  As is demonstrated, the intan-
gible nature of patent rights challenged  many early notions of tax law.
A.  APPLYING  GENERAL ASSET CAPITALIZATION  TO
RESEARCH COSTS
Since inception of the modern federal income tax, the Code has per-
mitted  a  current  deduction  for  ordinary  and  necessary  business  ex-
penses.16  The Code has precluded, however, a current deduction for so-
called "capital expenditures,"  historically viewed as any expenditure  that
produces  an asset lasting beyond the current tax period.17  Applying the
asset capitalization rule to tangible property presents few problems.  If a
business spends money  to construct  a widget-making  machine, a classic
capital asset  (i.e.,  a separate  and distinct asset lasting beyond the con-
15.  There has been a tremendous amount of tax legislation since 1913. It was not until
1950, however, that Congress enacted a tax provision specific to intellectual property.  See
infra Part V.
16.  Revenue Act of 1913, ch. 16, § II(B), 38 Stat. 114, 167 ("[I]n computing net income
for the purpose of the normal tax there shall be allowed as deductions:  First, the necessary
expenses actually paid in carrying on any business ....  ). For the current business expense
allowance provision, see I.R.C. § 162 (2010).
17.  Revenue Act of 1913, ch. 16, § II(B), 38 Stat. 114, 167 (providing "[t]hat no deduc-
tion shall be allowed for any amount paid out for new buildings, permanent improvements,
or betterments, made to increase the value of any property"). For the current disallowance
provisions, see I.R.C. §§ 263, 263A (2010).  The reason capital expenditures  are not cur-
rently deductible  is  that the  property created or acquired  is  not consumed or used up
within the year but rather continues to contribute to income over a period of years.  If the
costs incurred in the creation or acquisition of such property were deductible in full in the
current year, there would be a mismatching  of income and expenses that produced that
income; income would be understated in the year of creation or acquisition and overstated
in later years.  By prohibiting the immediate deduction of capital expenditures, this prob-
lem is avoided.SMU LAW REVIEW [Vol. 64
struction year), the construction costs are not currently deductible.18  In
contrast, applying the asset capitalization  rule to research and develop-
ment costs can be challenging for a number of reasons.  It is often difficult
to determine when research activities result in an identifiable  asset, the
costs of which must be capitalized.  Further, because research may span
several years with varying degrees of success, it is often difficult to appor-
tion costs if a particular project partly succeeds  and partly fails or when
different  and simultaneous  research  activities  contribute  in varying de-
grees to the development of an asset or assets.19
Perhaps it was for these reasons that the Treasury adopted  a liberal
approach in its initial treatment of research costs.  In 1919, it promulgated
a regulation that gave taxpayers the option of either deducting or capital-
izing  expenses  "for  designs, drawings,  patterns,  models, or work of an
experimental nature [if] calculated to result in improvement[s] of [taxpay-
ers'] facilities or [taxpayers']  product[s].''20  Shortly thereafter, however,
the Treasury deleted the regulation21  because it found that certain  tax-
payers were  enjoying double  tax benefits from their research-i.e.,  de-
ducting research  expenses  when paid, but also capitalizing  them in the
basis of developed patents thereby reducing gain on later sales.22  Even
though the Treasury eliminated the deduction option, the Internal Reve-
nue Service (the Service)  continued to allow certain taxpayers to deduct
research expenditures-namely  those  taxpayers who engaged in regular
and continual research activities and who had established practices of ac-
counting  for research  costs.23  Courts did  not necessarily find  the  Ser-

models, or work of an experimental nature calculated to result in improvement of his facili-

taxable year in which they are incurred or treat such articles as a capital asset to the extent
of the amount so expended.").

(1925); Goodell-Pratt Co. v. Comm'r, 3 B.T.A. 30, 33-34 (1925).  In these cases, the gov-
ernment argued capitalization was not appropriate since the taxpayer had elected earlier to
deduct research costs.  The court found, however, that capitalization was proper since re-
search costs resulted in creation of a patent.  Gilliam Mfg. Co., 1 B.T.A. at 970; Goodell-

vice's  administrative policy binding.24  Indeed, if the Service challenged
the  deduction  of  research  costs  incurred  in  the  development  of  new
processes, formulae, or patents, courts generally adhered to the asset-cap-
italization principle.25
But without a framework for resolving tax disputes, courts struggled to
apply the asset-capitalization rule to research costs.  Should capitalization
depend on the taxpayer's subjective intent or purpose of research activi-
ties, or should capitalization depend on the success of research activities?
In other words, should capitalization be required if the taxpayer intends
to improve  an existing product or develop  a new process  or patent, or
should capitalization be required only if the taxpayer develops a capital
asset having a useful life beyond the year?  Moreover, should a distinc-
tion be drawn between  expenditures  incurred  for general  scientific re-
search  and expenditures  to develop  patents  on a particular  process  or
formula?  And when should capitalization apply to payments for techni-
cal assistance and know-how of services?  There was lack of uniformity in
addressing these and other important questions.26
Requiring  capitalization  of  research  expenditures  seemed  somewhat
harsh,  especially  if  research  efforts  ultimately  proved  unsuccessful.  In
such cases, tax law  did permit an abandonment  loss  deduction  for the
year in which abandonment occurred.27 But a loss deduction upon subse-
quent failure of research efforts was hardly viewed as an adequate  eco-
nomic incentive for taxpayers to engage in desirable research activities.28

material using biological processes; however nothing of commercial value or of patentable
nature was developed, so the biological research was dropped.  Id. at 154-55.  The court
held that the research expenditures were not currently deductible since they were calcu-

thing of a commercial and permanent value to petitioner."  Id. at 156.

tax deductions. Current deductions reduce the taxpayer's current tax liability thereby leav-
ing the taxpayer with  the use of his or her money for longer.  Because  money makes
money, the use of money has value.  This is commonly referred to as "the time value of
money."  See generally PAMELA PETERSON DRAKE & FRANK J. FABOZZI, FOUNDATIONS

This highlights a fundamental problem with the general asset-capitaliza-
tion rule: not only was it highly difficult to apply to research and develop-
ment,  but  more  significantly,  it  also  served  to  actually  discourage
important research and experimentation.29
B.  APPLYING HISTORIC DEPRECIATION  RULES TO PATENT
ACQUISITION  COSTS
In an economic sense, depreciation is the decline in value of an asset
due to wear and tear and obsolescence.30  From the tax perspective, de-
preciation is a deduction from income, permitting the taxpayer to recover
the capitalized cost of that asset.31  Depreciation methods are sometimes
called cost recovery systems.32  So, for example, if an asset used in busi-
ness for  five years  cost  a  taxpayer $20,000,  the taxpayer  might  take  a
$4,000 deduction each year on her taxes for five years to reflect the de-
cline in value of that asset and to reflect its contribution to the production
of taxable income.  The entire cost of the asset is not deducted all at once
because the asset helped produce income over five years.33 To match the
taxpayer's  expenses against the revenues  they helped produce,  the tax-
payer must spread out the deduction over the useful life of the asset.34
This is, of course, a basic application of the principle discussed above-
that the costs of assets must be capitalized.
An early Treasury regulation adopted a seemingly simple rule for the
depreciation of intangible assets.  If an acquired intangible asset could be
shown to have a limited useful life, then the capitalized acquisition costs
were recoverable (deductible) over that asset's lifetime.35 As a corollary,
the capitalized cost of an intangible asset that had no definite useful life
was  not recoverable  through  depreciation but could  only be recovered
upon abandonment or disposition of the asset.36  Under this legal frame-
work, patents  and copyrights  were eligible  for depreciation  due  to the
fact that they have limited useful lives (statutory legal lives of 20 years in
the case of patents, and 70, 95, or 120 years in the case of certain copy-

34.  At the end of the asset's useful life, the acquisition costs will have been fully recov-
ered, and the asset's basis will be zero, reflecting that all capitalized costs have been recov-
ered fully.  See I.R.C. § 1016(a)(2)  (2010) (providing that the asset's basis is reduced each

rights).37  In contrast, other traditional intellectual property rights (trade
secrets, trademarks, trade names) were not eligible for depreciation be-
cause they do not have limited lives.38  The same was true for goodwill;
the  costs  of  acquiring  goodwill  were  not  eligible  for  amortization  al-
lowances, as goodwill does not have an ascertainable limited life.39 These
early depreciation rules for recovering the capitalized costs of intangibles
created several problems.
One problem  with the  historic depreciation  rule  for intangibles  was
that it caused much litigation concerning the identification  and valuation
of intangible assets.40  No deduction for depreciation was allowable with
respect  to goodwill,  so  taxpayers  tried to  distinguish  intangible  assets
from goodwill; the Service often challenged those determinations.41 The
touching point was  that goodwill  was viewed  by the government  as an
umbrella covering all intangible  assets of a business.  This historical con-
cept of goodwill led to considerable controversy between taxpayers  and
the Service.  While taxpayers  attempted to argue  that a wide variety of
intangible assets were  independent assets severable  from goodwill (and
eligible for depreciation provided they had a limited useful life), the Ser-
vice strongly held to the position that these intangible assets were indis-
tinguishable  or  inseparable  from  goodwill  (and  not  eligible  for
depreciation).42  Clear guidance was needed for taxpayers who, for exam-
37.  A patent confers the right to exclude others from making, using, selling, offering
for sale, or importing the claimed invention for a certain term of years (currently twenty
years from the  date of application).  35 U.S.C. § 154(a)(2), (d)  (2001).  Ownership of a
valid copyright confers five exclusive rights for a limited time. Id. The Copyright Act, over
the years, has lengthened the term of copyright protection.  Currently, a work of author-
ship enjoys a term of the life of the author and seventy years thereafter.  17 U.S.C. § 302(a)
(2005).  For works created under the doctrine of "works made for hire," the term is ninety-
five years after first publication or 120 years after creation.  Id. § 302(c).
38.  There is no specific term of protection for trade secrets; the protection is available
as long as confidential proprietary information is kept in secrecy, which could be indefinite.
See UNIF. TRADE SECRETS Acr § 1 (amended  1985), 14 U.L.A. 537-38 (1990).  Likewise,
there is no specific term of protection for trademarks and trade names; the protection is
available as long as the trademark or trade name is used in commerce and has not been
abandoned.  See 15 U.S.C. § 1127 (2009)  (providing presumption of abandonment if non-
use of a trademark extends for three years).

42.  The controversy over whether to characterize  intangible assets as goodwill  was
eventually settled with the Supreme Court's decision in Newark Morning Ledger Co. v.
United States. 507 U.S. 546, 570 (1993).  The Supreme Court held that amortization of an
intangible asset depends on whether the asset is capable of being valued and whether theSMU LAW REVIEW [Vol. 64
ple,  purchased  patents  along  with  certain  associated  trademarks  and
other intangibles.
Even if patents and other intangible assets were capable of being sepa-
rately identified  and valued, controversies  existed over the appropriate
cost recovery methods and recovery periods for such assets.  A common
method  for  depreciating  patent  costs  was  the  so-called  "straight-line
method,"  under which capitalized acquisition costs  are deducted ratably
over the asset's estimated useful life.43  Application of this seemingly sim-
ple method raised a number of questions.  For example,  was the useful
life of a patent the statutory legal life of the patent, or instead, the period
over which the patent was reasonably  expected to be useful to the tax-
payer in his or her business or in the production of income?  If the latter
approach was appropriate, should the taxpayer establish useful life based
upon some general  industry  standard, or should the  taxpayer establish
useful life of a patent based upon his or her own experiences with similar
property?  If useful life was based on taxpayer experiences, what was the
appropriate  standard in forecasting the asset's  useful life?  In  1969, the
Service  authorized a five-year  amortization period for software  acquisi-
tion costs rendering these questions moot for software.44
The usefulness  of some patents is not adequately  measurable  by the
passage of time alone but is more accurately  measurable by the income
the patent produces.  As a result of distortions caused by the straight-line
method, the Service eventually permitted patents to be depreciated under
the so-called "income forecast method," under which costs are recovered
as income is earned from exploitation of the patent.45  The depreciation
allowance in any given year is computed by multiplying the original capi-
talized  acquisition  cost  of the  patent  by  a  fraction,  the numerator  of
which is income from the patent for the taxable year, and the denomina-
tor of which is the forecasted or estimated total income to be earned in
connection with the patent during its useful life.46 While the income fore-
cast  method  is  perhaps  more  accurate  in  reflecting  income  than  the
straight-line method, its application is complex.  It is often difficult to de-
termine yearly and forecasted income for purposes of the above formula;
revised  computations  are  required  if estimates  are  substantially  over-
stated or underestimated  as a result of circumstances  that arise in later

payer must also prove that the intangible is separate and distinct from goodwill.  Id.

46.  The  following simple example illustrates the computation:  In Year 1, Taxpayer
purchases a patent for $100 and estimates that forecasted total income from the patent will
be $200.  In Year 1, the patent generates income of $80.  The depreciation allowance for
Year 1 is $40, computed by multiplying the capitalized acquisition cost of $100 by the frac-
tion obtained by dividing current year income of $80 by forecasted total income of $200.
Under this approach, 40% of forecasted income was earned in Year 1, so 40%  of the total
purchase cost was deducted in Year 1. See Treas. Reg. § 1.167(n)-4(e),  Ex. 1.2011] The History of Intellectual Property Taxation
years,47 and a complex set of "look back" rules may require a taxpayer to
pay interest to the government if deductions were accelerated due to un-
derestimation of expected income.48
Another  problem  with  the  historical  depreciation  scheme  stemmed
from the fact that the rules for depreciating intangible intellectual prop-
erty assets differed  dramatically from the corresponding set of rules for
depreciating  tangible assets.  Over time, Congress enacted  a detailed  set
of arbitrary depreciation rules for all tangible assets.  These Code provi-
sions provided arbitrary conventions  and methods for depreciating costs
of tangible  assets and, more importantly, provided artificially low recov-
ery periods (e.g.,  three,  five, and seven years) for many tangible  assets
that arguably  have longer  useful lives.49  This  disparate  treatment  be-
tween intellectual property assets and tangible assets created distortions
that were  unfair  to taxpayers.50  For  example,  taxpayers  who  acquired
businesses  with mostly tangible  assets  fared  better than taxpayers  who
acquired  businesses  with mostly intellectual  property assets, a  problem
that worsened as more and more valuable business assets took the form
of intellectual  property  assets.5'  Seeking  to mitigate  these distortions,
many saw the need to reconcile the treatment of acquired  intangible as-
sets with the treatment of acquired  tangible assets.52
C.  APPLYING  GENERAL SALE  PRINCIPLES TO PATENT  DISPOSITIONS
A transfer of property for consideration is treated for tax purposes as
either a sale or a  license-with significant  tax differences depending  on
how the transfer is characterized.  If a property transfer is considered  a
sale for tax purposes, then the transferor is permitted to recover tax-free
any remaining basis in the property transferred,53 and the resulting gain
may be  taxed  at preferential  capital  gain  rates rather  than the  much
higher ordinary income rates.54  If, however,  the transfer is characterized

tween similarly situated taxpayers resulted in noncompliance and much litigation, which
unnecessarily burdened the administration of tax law).

54.  Individual taxpayers generally prefer gains to be classified as capital gains rather
than ordinary income because certain capital gains are afforded preferential tax treatment.
Presently,  the maximum  rate at which  most long-term capital  gains are taxed is  15%,
whereas the highest rate at which other types of income (ordinary income and short-term
capital gains) are taxed is 35%-a significant rate differential for high earners. See I.R.C.
§ 1(a)-(d), (i)(1)-(2).  Under general tax principles, preferential capital gain treatment re-SMU LAW REVIEW [Vol. 64
as a license for tax purposes,  the transferor is not permitted  to recover
any basis in the property, and the full amounts received must be reported
and taxed as ordinary income  rather than capital gain.  Characterizing  a
transfer of tangible property as either a sale or license for tax purposes is
relatively straightforward in most cases.  If a property owner has fee sim-
ple title to a  piece of land  (i.e.,  owns the  whole  "bundle  of sticks"  or
"attributes of ownership") and transfers title in fee simple to a buyer for
consideration, a "sale" has occurred.  Characterizing the transfer of intan-
gible  intellectual property rights  under  general tax  principles  is  not as
easy.
Determining whether a patent transfer was a sale or license under gen-
eral tax principles was the subject of many early court decisions.  In con-
trast to most land transactions,  wherein sellers transfer all attributes of
ownership  for a lump sum, patent transfers  typically  include numerous
limitations and restrictions and often involve contingent payments resem-
bling royalties.  And so numerous courts were called upon to tackle hard
questions: What are the substantial attributes of patent ownership?  Must
the entire  bundle of rights (sticks) be given away for sale treatment, or
may certain rights be retained?  Should the existence of contingent pay-
ments  preclude  sale  treatment  even  if  all  ownership  rights  were
transferred?
In establishing the basic criteria of a sale under general tax rules, courts
held that a patent owner must transfer the exclusive right to make, use,
and sell the patented article; anything short of that was not a sale but a
license.55  An "exclusive license" to manufacture, use, and sell for the life
quires a "sale or exchange" of a "capital asset."  I.R.C. §§ 1221, 1222 (2010).  See JOHN A.
MILLER & JEFFREY A. MAINE, THE FUNDAMENTALS  OF FEDERAL TAXATION 219 (2d ed.
2010) (giving several policy reasons for the tax rate preference accorded to capital gains).
55.  A large number of tax cases followed Waterman, one of the leading authorities
dealing with the transfer of patents.  Waterman v. Mackenzie, 138 U.S. 252 (1891).  In that
case, the Supreme Court said:
Whether a transfer of a particular right or interest under a patent is an as-
signment or a license does not depend upon the name by which it calls itself,
but upon the legal effect of its provisions.  For instance, a grant of an exclu-
sive right to make, use, and vend two patented  machines within  a certain
district is an assignment, and gives the grantee the right to sue in his own
name for an infringement within the district, because the right, although lim-
ited to making, using, and vending two machines, excludes all other persons,
even the patentee, from making, using, or vending like machines within the
district.  On the other hand, the grant of an exclusive right under the patent
within a certain district, which does not include the right to make, and the
right to use, and the right to sell, is not a grant of a title in the whole patent-
right within the district, and is therefore only a license.  Such, for instance, is
a grant of 'the full and  exclusive right to make and vend'  within a certain
district, reserving to the grantor the right to make within the district, to be
sold outside of it.  So is a grant of 'the exclusive right to make and use,' but
not to sell, patented machines within a certain district.  So is an instrument
granting 'the sole right and privilege of manufacturing and selling' patented
articles, and not expressly authorizing their use, because, though this might
carry by implication the right to use articles made under the patent by the
licensee, it certainly would not authorize him to use such articles made by
others.2011] The History of Intellectual Property Taxation
of a patent would be considered a sale because, in substantive effect, all
right, title, and interest in the property was transferred irrespective of the
location of legal title  or other formalities  of language  contained  in the
license  agreement.56  In  contrast,  a  "nonexclusive  license"-a  transfer
that granted the transferee  only segregated or limited rights-would be
considered a license rather than a sale.57  For example, transfers with du-
ration limitations,58  transfers  that divided the manufacturing  of patents
between  the transferor  and transferee,59 and transfers  that granted the
right to make and sell but not the right to "use"60 were generally treated
as licenses rather than sales for tax purposes.
Under this broad framework, much litigation centered on determining
what restrictions or limitations in particular patent agreements precluded
a finding  of a  sale for tax  purposes.  Many  patent  assignments  contain
geographical limitations  or field-of-use restrictions.  Should the grant of
an exclusive right to make, use, and sell a  patent to only a certain geo-
graphical  area be considered  a  sale for  tax purposes,  even though  the
transferor retained those rights with respect to all other geographical ar-
eas?61  Similarly, should the grant of the exclusive right to make, use, and
sell a patent  to only  a  particular industry be considered  a sale for tax
purposes even though the transferor retained those rights with respect to
all other industries? 62  Many patent  agreements also contain certain  re-
strictions that serve to protect the transferor, raising additional questions:
Should a patent transfer be deemed a sale for tax purposes even though
Id. at 255-56 (holding that an agreement by which a patent owner granted "the sole and
exclusive right and  license to manufacture and sell"  the patented  article throughout the
United States was not an assignment, but a license) (internal citations omitted).  Waterman
involved the question of who were the indispensable parties in an infringement suit.  As a
result, not all courts followed the Court's view as to what constitutes a patent assignment
for tax purposes.  See, e.g., Bloch v. United States, 200 F.2d 63 (2d Cir. 1952) ("Different
considerations were obviously involved, and the court's statement as to what constitutes an
assignment of title to a patent is not necessarily controlling in the field of taxation.").

the transferor reserves the right to terminate in the event of transferee's
insolvency, bankruptcy, or failure to make payments?63  Should a patent
transfer be deemed a sale despite a restriction that the transferee  cannot
grant a sublicense  without the written  consent of the transferor, if the
purchase price is paid in installments and the restriction served to protect
the parties?64  Similarly, should the transferor's retention of the right to
sue for infringement necessarily preclude a finding of a sale if the restric-
tion is viewed  as a security device?65
In addition to struggling with these important questions, the govern-
ment and  courts also struggled with the impact,  if any,  that contingent
payments should have on the "license versus sale" determination.  In con-
trast to real property transactions, which often involve lump sum or in-
stallment  payments,  patent  agreements  typically  involve  payments
measured by the production, sale, or use by the transferee, or payments
payable over a period generally coterminous with the transferee's use of
the patent.  And so the question  arose:  should  a patent  assignment  be
denied sale treatment solely because the purchase price took the form of
contingent payments?  Early cases were  split on the issue.  Some courts
held that the receipt  of contingent payments  did not prevent  a transfer
from being considered a sale,66 while others held that the receipt of con-
tingent payments did preclude sale treatment.67  The Service itself strug-
gled with the issue.  In a 1950 administrative pronouncement,  the Service
ruled that an assignment  of a patent  (or the exclusive  license to make,
use, and sell a patented article) would nevertheless be treated as a license
for tax purposes (and, hence, payments  received  by inventors would be
taxed as ordinary income) where the transferor received interests resem-
bling royalties.68 Five years later, the Service issued another ruling reiter-
63.  For early cases holding that transfers were sales despite cancellation rights, see

position and  ruled that patent  transferors could  enjoy  "sale"  treatment
(and, hence, capital gain treatment) even though consideration received
is measured by production, use, or sale of the patented article.70
Without specific rules governing patent transfers, courts struggled with
the  attributes  of  patent  ownership  when  examining  individual  patent
agreements  in  their  factual  context.  A  framework  slowly  evolved-a
framework  that clearly  challenged  normative  notions  of what  was  and
what was not a sale for tax purposes.  Indeed, it was possible for a court
to conclude that a  patent  agreement was  a sale for tax purposes, even
though  the  agreement  was  titled  "License  Agreement,"  the  parties
therein were designated "Licensor" and "Licensee,"  the agreement con-
tained  geographical  limitations  and  field-of-use  and  other  restrictions,
and the agreement called for "royalty" payments contingent on the use or
exploitation of the patent  by  the transferee.71  In  light of the inherent
factual nature of the "sale versus license"  distinction, in general, and the
unique characteristics of patent ownership, in particular, there was a need
for a set of predictable tax rules.
III.  SOURCES OF EARLY DISSONANCE BETWEEN THE
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND TAXATION REGIMES
A.  ACCEPTING INTELLECTUAL  PROPERTY As PROPERTY
Different types of intellectual property rights were treated as property
by courts in the late nineteenth century.  For example, in 1868, the court
in Peabody v.  Norfolk recognized  that a trade secret is property.72  And
later  the  U.S.  Supreme  Court  held  that  a  regulation  requiring
the  disclosure  of  a  trade  secret  was  a  taking  of property  in violation
of the Fifth Amendment.73  Courts have long recognized patents as prop-
with the transferee's  use of the patent, such agreement, for income tax purposes, is to be
regarded as providing for the payment of royalties taxable as ordinary income.").

permitted transfers of trademarks together with the associated goodwill, without the need

marks were valuable to the owners because they signified the quality of
the goods or services  and assured the public  that the goods or services
offered were the genuine product of the manufacturers and owners.79
Although it was well-established  that intellectual property was prop-
erty, many early tax cases  struggled to identify when intangible intellec-
tual property rights constituted separable property for tax purposes.  Such
a determination is critical in numerous tax contexts.  For example, appli-
cation  of the  asset-capitalization  rule  to  intellectual property  develop-
ment  costs  hinged  on  whether  the  research  activity  resulted  in  an
identifiable  asset.  Application of early tax depreciation rules to intellec-
tual property acquisition  costs  centered on whether  an intangible  asset
existed and whether, in a business acquisition, the value of the intangible
was reasonably determinable.  The "property"  question is central  to de-
termining  the property  tax treatment  of any disposition.  For instance,
preferential capital gain treatment requires a sale of a capital asset.80  If
one could not first conclude  that the object of a transfer was property,
then how could there be a sale-much less a sale of a capital asset-for
tax purposes?
As described  in this Part, the government and courts often struggled
with  the competing concepts  of property  that could  yield  different tax
results.  In some  cases,  courts and  tax  authorities cleverly  avoided  the
property issue when resolving a particular tax question, which did nothing
to guide future  decisions.  In some transactional contexts, the approach
adopted was to declare attributes of intellectual property ownership irrel-
evant and to instead focus on the tangible medium embodying the intel-
lectual property.
In  the  marketplace,  copyrights  could  be  divided  and  the  exclusive
rights to copyrighted works in one medium of publication could be sold
separately.81  Likewise,  trademarks  could  be  divided  into  separately
1375 (Fed. Cir. 1982) ("A valid transfer of a mark, however, does not require the transfer
of any physical or tangible assets.  All  that is necessary is the transfer of the goodwill to
which the mark pertains.").  For another early decision mentioning trademarks as property,
see Mfg.  Co. v. Trainer, 101 U.S. 51,  66-67 (1879)  ("Trade-marks  usually  exhibit some
peculiar device, vignette, or symbol, in addition to the name of the party, which the propri-
etor had a perfect  right to appropriate, and which, as well as the name, is intended as a
declaration to the public that the article is his property.").
79.  See Manhattan Med. Co. v. Wood, 108 U.S. 218, 222-23 (1883) ("Any one has as
unquestionable right to affix to articles manufactured by him a mark or device not previ-
ously appropriated, to distinguish them from articles of the same general character manu-
factured or sold by others.  He may thus notify the public of the origin of the article, and
secure to himself the benefits of any particular excellence it may possess from the manner
or materials of its manufacture.  His trade-mark is both a sign of the quality of the article
and an assurance to the public that it is the genuine product of his manufacture.  It thus
often becomes of great value to him, and in its exclusive use the court will protect him
against attempts of others to pass off their products upon the public as his. This protection
is afforded  not only  as a matter of justice to him, but to prevent  imposition  upon the
public.")  (citing Trainer, 101 U.S. at 54).

81.  The Copyright Act of 1976 lists important rights of copyright ownership and pro-
vides  that  these  rights  may  be  subdivided.  See  17  U.S.C.  § 106  (2006);  see also id.
§ 201(d)(2)  (providing that "[a]ny of the exclusive rights comprised in a copyright, includ-SMU LAW REVIEW [Vol. 64
transferable fractions according to the usage of the market in which the
trademarked  goods  move.82  For tax  purposes,  however,  should  these
marketplace concepts  of property  (the splitting up of bundles of rights)
be accepted, or should traditional property concepts  (the law relating to
the passage of title) be adopted?  In determining the appropriate tax re-
sult of a particular intellectual property transfer, the competing concepts
of property could lead to different results.  While there was much initial
uncertainty  and litigation over the divisibility  of copyrights, trademarks,
and  trade  names  for  tax purposes,  most  courts  eventually  focused  on
ownership of beneficial interests as opposed to legal title.
In the case of copyrights, the Service and some courts initially adopted
the view that a copyright was not divisible into separable properties and
that a grant of less than all the rights conferred by a copyright was not a
sale for tax purposes but rather a license.83  In one case involving an as-
signment of the exclusive motion picture rights to a play that the taxpayer
had created, the Second Circuit adhered to traditional property concepts,
stating:
When ... the assignee acquires less than the sum of all the rights
which together make up the copyright which as a whole is property
and may be conveyed as such,..  .the so-called assignment amounts
only to a license....  Unless the assignment conveys to the assigned
the title to the copyright, no sale of property is made.84
Some courts later accepted market concepts and held that a copyright
was divisible for tax purposes.85  And the Service later conceded, ruling
that a grant (for a lump sum payment) of the exclusive right to exploit a
ing any subdivision of any of the rights specified  by section 106, may be transferred  as
provided by clause (1) and owned separately.  The owner of any particular exclusive right
is entitled, to the extent of that right, to all of the protection and remedies accorded to the
copyright owner by this title").  Under substantive copyright law, "[c]opyright  protection
subsists ...  in original works of authorship fixed in any tangible medium of expression"
including "(1)  literary works; (2)  musical works, including any accompanying words; (3)
dramatic  works, including any accompanying  music; (4) pantomimes and choreographic
works; (5) pictorial, graphic, and sculptural works; (6) motion pictures and other audiovi-
sual works; (7) sound recordings; and (8)  architectural works."  Id. § 102(a).
82.  See New York & Rosendale Cement Co. v. Coplay Cement Co., 45 F. 212, 212-13
(C.C.E.D.  Pa. 1891) ("In  holding that it is  necessary to the validity of a trade-mark  or

jointly or severally.  Copartners, upon a dissolution of partnership may stipulate that each
of them may use the trade-marks of the firm, and there may be many other cases of joint
and several ownership; but such co-owners will together be entitled to the exclusive use of

copyrighted work "in a medium of publication throughout the life of the

In the case of trademarks and trade names, a similar debate occurred
over divisibility and appropriate  concepts of property.  The monopoly a
trademark or trade name owner is granted by the government is a prop-
erty right.  Such right may be assigned  or transferred, for example, in a
limited territory.  Should such a grant, which does not dispose of the en-
tire property of the grantor, be treated as a sale or a license for tax pur-
poses?  Courts addressing  this particular issue  generally  concluded  that
sale treatment was proper, even though the grantor retained naked, legal
87
title.
In some  difficult  cases,  courts  avoided  the  property  question  when
resolving  a particular tax conflict  involving intellectual property.  Con-
sider the issue  of whether the assignment  of an abstract idea should be
entitled to preferential capital gain treatment.  The Code defines a "capi-
tal gain" as gain from the "sale or exchange"  of a "capital asset."88  Since
1950,  the Code  has  specifically  excluded  from the definition  of capital
asset "a  copyright, a literary, musical, or artistic composition, . . . or simi-
lar property,  held  by  a  taxpayer whose  personal  efforts  created  such
property."89
In Regenstein v. Commissioner,t he taxpayer, an insurance agent, devel-
oped an idea or plan for selling  group life insurance  to federal  govern-
ment employees.90  He sold his plan to an insurance company for $10,000.
The issue before the court was whether that amount was taxable as ordi-
nary  income  (the government's  argument)  or as  capital  gain  (the tax-
payer's argument).91 The court concluded that the amount was taxable as
ordinary income  because the payment was for services rendered  by the
taxpayer to the life insurance companies.92  Although the court expressed
doubt as to whether the taxpayer's  idea could be considered property, it
specifically  left the issue undecided and instead focused on whether the
transfer to a film corporation constituted a sale of all the plaintiff's motion pictures rights
in the novel).

Service's ruling applied only if the consideration received was not contingent (i.e., "mea-

.payment was for services rendered by the taxpayer.93
In a similar case, Cranford v. United States, the taxpayer conceived and
invented a format or structure for a radio program.94  The taxpayer, who
was unable to obtain a copyright on either the radio program or the es-
sential feature of the proposed program, subsequently assigned and con-
veyed all  of his  title  and interest in the radio  program,  conceived and
invented by him, to an unrelated company  in return for a percentage  of
payments received by the company in connection with the licensing of the
use of the program.  The tax issue before  the court was whether  these
payments were taxable as ordinary income (the government's argument)
or as capital gains (the taxpayer's argument).95  Despite the government's
contention that the taxpayer's format or idea was not property, the court
instead focused at length on whether the radio format was a capital asset;
specifically, the court addressed whether the radio format was "similar"
to literary, musical, or artistic compositions and, as such, within the capi-
tal  asset exclusion.96  The  taxpayer  argued that  his  "format"  was  not
copyrightable  and was not one of the specifically named items, and thus,
the format was not excluded from the definition of a capital asset.97  The
court rejected the taxpayer's argument and held that the format was not a
capital asset.98
The courts in Regenstein and Cranford found a way to resolve the tax
disputes at issue but provided an inappropriate framework for similar fu-
ture  cases.  A preliminary issue in each case  should have been whether
the ideas constituted property.  If they were incapable of being property
held by the taxpayer, then how could there have been a sale-much less a
sale of a capital  asset?
The Service avoided the property  issue in determining  the tax conse-
quences  of using intellectual property in corporate  capitalizations.  The
transfer of intellectual property to a corporation in exchange for stock in
that corporation is potentially a taxable event.99  But a special Code pro-
vision, section 351, provides that no gain or loss shall be recognized upon
the transfer by one or more persons of property to a corporation solely in
exchange for stock in such corporation if, after the exchange, such person
93.  See id. ("While there exists grave doubt here whether petitioner's plan or idea was
one that could be considered to be property, and, further, if it were considered property,
whether it would not come within the exclusion of property similar to a copyright, literary,
musical, or artistic composition, we need not decide these questions, since in our view the
facts taken as a whole support respondent's contention that the payment was for services
rendered ...  to Metropolitan and its associated companies.")  (citations omitted).

In Revenue  Ruling 64-56, the Service took the position that the trans-
fer of "all substantial rights" in technical know-how would be treated as a
transfer of property for purposes  of section 351  of the Code.02  Soon
after announcing its position, the Service was asked to address whether a
nonexclusive license of a patent was property under section 351.  In Rev-
enue Ruling 69-156, the taxpayer granted certain patent rights in a chemi-
cal compound to its foreign subsidiary corporation in exchange for stock
in the subsidiary, retaining for itself the substantial rights to import, use,
and sell the chemical  compound  in the country in which  the subsidiary
operated.103 The Service concluded that the transferee subsidiary did not
have all substantial rights in the patent, and, therefore, the grant of the
patent rights did not constitute a transfer of property within the meaning
of section 351.104
In  these rulings, the  Service skirted the issue  of whether  intangibles
were  property under  section  351  and  instead  focused  on whether  the
grant of intangibles would constitute a sale rather than a license for capi-
tal  gain  purposes  (i.e.,  whether  the  grant  consisted  of  all  substantial
rights).  In the Service's view, if a transaction did not qualify as a sale for
capital  gain purposes, it could not be a transfer of property for section
351 purposes.  One court was quick to eschew this approach.  In E. L Du
Pont de Nemours & Co. v.  United States, the  United  States Court  of
Claims held that a nonexclusive license of patents was property covered
by section 351.105  Determining that section 351 was an autonomous pro-
vision, the court declared capital gain concepts (in particular, the sale ver-
sus  license  distinction)  irrelevant.'06  In  holding  that the nonexclusive
license was property, the court stated: "Both patents themselves and the
exclusive licensing of patents have long been considered 'property'  under
351.  It is not a far step to include  a non-exclusive  license of substantial
value-commonly thought of in the commercial world as a positive busi-
ness asset. '107  A few years after Du Pont, the Service changed its posi-
tion, stating that it no longer believed that "all substantial rights in 'know-
how' or a patent  held by the transferor must be transferred in order to
constitute the transfer of property for purposes of [section] 351.1108

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTIES
The four traditional forms of intellectual property share some common
characteristics.109 They are all intangible personal property; they have no
physical form.""  One cannot really touch them and feel them as one can
touch land and feel the texture of the soil."'  They generally depend on
physical forms for their creative existence." 2 For a modern example, the
trademark  Coca-Cola written  on this page has only slight  meaning, but
when it appears on a red beverage can it becomes a powerful symbol of a
globally recognized product.1 3  Likewise, the copyright for Dan Brown's
The Da Vinci Code requires either a book, CD, or other tangible medium
embodying the words of the novel." 4  The patent for Viagra needs the
actual pills to carry out the potent effects claimed by the pharmaceutical
company. 15 The trade secret in the soft drink Coca-Cola is embodied in
the brown liquid  flowing from the tin can or  bottle into our bodies to

These four types of intellectual property, though we cannot see them,
touch them, or feel them, are everywhere.117  They exist  wherever the

The four types of intellectual property, though their physical embodi-
ments are everywhere, share some similarities with respect to exclusivity
rights.125 That means, if one person, group, or company has the right, no
others can have it.126  For example,  the owner of a trademark  has the
right to exclude others from using an identical or similar trademark for
the same or similar products or services if the use is likely to cause con-
sumer confusion.127  The owner of a patent can exclude others from us-
ing, making, selling, or exporting the patented products.128 The owner of
a copyright has the exclusive rights  to make  copies, prepare  derivative
works, distribute the copyrighted work, publicly perform  the work, and
publicly  display  the work.129  The owner of a  trade secret  can bring  a
misappropriations  case  against  others for unauthorized  use  of its trade
secret.130
Despite their similarities, there are many differences among these four
types of intellectual property.  Patents and copyrights are unique.  Both
patents and copyrights are specific grants dictated by the U.S. Constitu-
U.S.C. § 106 and provided that each "may be transferred ...  and owned separately"); see
also Fox Film Corp. v. Doyal, 286 U.S. 123, 127 (1932)  ("The owner of the copyright, if he
pleases, may refrain from vending or licensing and content himself with simply exercising
the right to exclude others from using his property.").

used in commerce to identify  a particular  source and to distinguish the
trademarked  products.139 That means the life of a trademark can be one

statute akin to the federal  trademark statute;146 each state has its own
trade  secret laws  to regulate.147  Most states  adopt all or parts of  the
model trade secret statute to recognize trade secrets and define what con-

secrets are deemed to have more traditional characteristics  of property
than the other types of intellectual property.149
In developing various tests for analyzing intellectual property transac-
tions, courts had to reconcile the substantive similarities  and differences
among the different types of intellectual property.  In some contexts, tax
cases  emphasized  the  substantive  similarities  among  the  forms  (e.g.,
grants of monopolies) and applied the case law that developed relating to
one type of intellectual property to other types.150  For example, as de-
scribed above, early case law established that in order for a transfer of a
patent to constitute a sale for tax purposes, all substantial rights had to be
transferred, and that sale treatment could result even though the consid-
eration received by the transferor  was measured by production, use, or
sale of the patented article.'5'  Several courts later used this framework in
determining  whether  or  not  the  transfer  of  a  copyright,  trade  secret,
trademark, or trade name constituted a sale for tax purposes.152
When confronted with whether a copyright assignment could be denied
sale treatment solely because the purchase price took the form of contin-
gent payments, the Service relied on its previous position with respect to
contingent payments in patent assignments:  "Since the property rights of
patents and copyrights  are similar in substance, it is concluded  that the

Service should adopt, in the case of copyrights, the position that is being
taken in the case of patents."1' 53
In analyzing whether or not the transfer of a trade secret meets the sale
requirement, a number of courts applied the tests that had been used in
analyzing patent assignments based on the valid and important similari-
ties between  a patent and a trade  secret.154  While a patent is different
from a trade secret (an essential element of the latter is the right in the
discoverer to prevent unauthorized disclosure),  an important similarity is
that "[tihe  value  in both lies in the rights  they give to their owners for
monopolistic exploitation. '155  A patent transfer meets the sale require-
ment only if the transferor transfers all substantial rights (e.g., the right to
prevent  others  from  operating  under  the  patent).156  By  analogy,  the
transfer of a trade secret constitutes a sale only if the transferor conveys
his or her most important rights-"the right to prevent unauthorized dis-
closure  and the  right to prevent further use  of the trade  secret  by all
57
others."1
In analyzing  the  tax treatment  of transfers  of trademarks  and  trade
names, some courts relied on the tax law that had developed on patent
transfers,  although such analogies were a bit less helpful.158  If a patent
transfer was considered a sale only if the transferor relinquished all sub-
stantial rights, then it would make sense that a trademark transfer should
be considered a sale only if the transferor did not retain significant rights
or  continuing  interests  with respect to the transferred  trademark.  But
what sorts  of retained  continuing interests  should preclude  sale  treat-
ment?  In a typical trademark or trade name transfer, it is not uncommon
for a variety of conditions to be included in the transfer agreement.  The

transferor may retain, for example, certain powers, rights, or continuing
interests in order to maintain some operational control of the trademark
or trade name (e.g., continuing to participate in employee training or con-
ducting advertising promotions).  Without any clear rules, and with only
general analogies to patent cases, early disputes  arose between the Ser-
vice and transferors of trademarks and trade names over the tax implica-
tions of such retained powers,  rights, or continuing  interests; numerous
courts  were  called upon to ascertain when varying  conditions in trade-
mark  and  trade name  agreements  were  significant  enough to preclude
sale treatment.  Some of the early cases dealing with the problem of dif-
ferentiating  a sale from a  license involved the transfer of Dairy Queen
franchises by territorial franchisors to individual subfranchisees.159 It was
not uncommon for courts to reach different results on virtually identical
facts. 160
At issue in many of the trademark and trade name cases was the effect,
if any, of the contingent payment arrangement.  As with patent and copy-
right transfers,  transfers  of trademarks  and trade  names  frequently in-
volve payments made by the transferee that are payable over a period of
time and  are contingent on production.  The question was  whether the
contingent payment arrangement was inconsistent with the characteristics
of a sale.  As noted earlier in this Article, the Service was quick to resolve
the issue in patent and copyright cases-the form of payment should not
influence  the decision as to whether a patent or copyright  assignment is
treated as a sale or license for tax purposes.161  The Service did not em-
ploy the same position in trademark  and trade name cases, viewing the
receipt  of contingent payments as a continuing economic interest similar
to the receipt of royalty  income.  There was much diversity of opinion
among  courts over  the  issue.  The form  of  payment  influenced  some
courts to treat the transaction as if it were a license, with the result that
the payments were taxable as ordinary income.162  Some other courts did
not regard  the form of payment  to be controlling, with  the result that

because  of the  rights, powers, and continuing interests retained  by the transferor.  See

payments received capital gain treatment.163  Courts struggled with such
questions  as the following:  Should contingent payment arrangements be
analyzed apart from the other conditions in the agreement?  Does it mat-
ter whether or not the payments were the only form of monetary consid-
eration?  Does it matter whether the transfer agreement was perpetual or
not?  Analogies in trademark  and trade name cases to patent cases pro-
vided little guidance, highlighting the need for specific tax rules governing
trademarks and trade name assets.
Courts did not always find all types of intellectual property sufficiently
similar to one another to warrant providing them similar treatment under
the tax laws.  In considering the deductibility of attorney's fees and other
litigation costs incurred in the pursuit and settlement of intellectual prop-
erty infringement actions,  courts focused on the substantive  differences
among the intellectual property forms in creating tax distinctions.  Under
general tax principles,  legal fees incurred  in a business or profit-seeking
context (e.g., those related to the production or collection of taxable in-
come) are deductible unless they are considered capital expenditures. 164
Regulations provide examples  of nondeductible capital  expenditures in-
cluding the cost of acquiring property with a "useful life substantially be-
yond the taxable year" and "[t]he  cost of defending or perfecting title to
property. '165  Accordingly,  attorney's fees in a suit to quiet title to land
are not deductible, but attorney's fees in a suit to collect accrued rents on
the land are deductible.166  To determine whether litigation costs-even if
incurred in a business or profit-seeking activity-are nondeductible capi-
tal  expenditures,  courts focus  on the claim's  origin and  character  with
respect to which the litigation  costs are incurred.167  The "origin of the
claim" test is not a purely mechanical test; it requires more than focusing
merely on the taxpayer's  intent in filing the suit.168  One must also con-
sider "the issues involved, the nature and objectives of the litigation, the
defenses asserted, the purpose for which the claimed deductions were ex-
pended,  the background of the litigation, and all facts pertaining to the
163.  See, e.g., Moberg, 310 F.2d at 784; Dairy Queen of Okla., Inc., 250 F.2d at 506.

expenses paid or incurred during the year in carrying on any trade or business); id. § 212

for the production or collection of income and for the management, conversation, or main-

167.  The "origin of the  claim"  test was  originally created by the Supreme Court in
United States v. Gilmore, 372 U.S. 39, 49 (1963), and was used to determine whether litiga-
tion costs were incurred in a business or profit-seeking context or whether the costs were
personal.  The origin of the claim standard has also been used to determine whether litiga-
tion costs-even if incurred  in a business or profit-seeking  activity-are nondeductible
capital expenditures.  Woodward v. Comm'r, 397 U.S. 572, 578-79 (1970) (holding that the
origin of the claim that gave rise to the legal fees was the acquisition of stock, and thus, the
fees should be capitalized).

controversy." 69
Using this framework to determine the deductibility or capitalization of
intellectual  property  litigation  costs  was  not  an  easy  task  for  courts.
Should all intellectual property litigation (e.g., patent infringement, copy-
right infringement,  and  trademark  infringement actions)  be viewed  the
same for tax purposes?  If the issues involved, the objectives of the litiga-
tion, and the defenses asserted in each are similar, then a standard based
on the origin of the claim litigated would dictate similar tax treatment of
legal costs incurred therein.  "While...  viewing all such intellectual prop-
erty litigation generically"  has "the unarguable appeal of expediency,"  it
"also ignores the actual inherent differences and purposes of the various
rights and remedies involved.' 170  Over time, tax courts struggled to iden-
tify and  reconcile the distinguishing  characteristics  of intellectual prop-
erty when determining the proper tax treatment of intellectual property
litigation costs.  In infringement cases, courts generally concluded that le-
gal fees incurred in patent  infringement actions  were  deductible.171  In
contrast, legal fees incurred in trademark infringement  actions were not
deductible but had to be capitalized.172 The apparent distinction was that
in patent and copyright infringement cases, litigation costs are incurred to
recover lost profits and damages and not to remove cloud of title or de-
fend ownership  of property.173  In trademark and trade  name infringe-
ment cases, litigation costs "resemble  the cost of perfecting or preserving
title to property, a cost well established as capital expenditures.' ' 74
C.  ESTABLISHING  SIGNIFICANCE  OF TANGIBLE  MEDIUM EMBODYING
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
As  described  earlier,  the traditional forms of intellectual  property-
patents, copyrights, trademarks,  and trade secrets-generally depend on
tangible forms for their creative existence.175  For example, the patent for
a drug needs the actual pills to carry out the potent effects claimed by the
patent owner, and the copyright  for an author's  novel requires  either a
book, CD, or other tangible medium embodying the words of the novel.
169.  Id.  The origin of the claim test has been used in a number of lower court cases.
See, e.g.,  Madden v. Comm'r,  514 F.2d  1149,  1151-52  (9th  Cir.  1975);  Fleischman  v.

Comm'r, 21 T.C.M. (CCH) 1038 (1962)  (holding costs of unsuccessful trademark infringe-
ment currently deductible).

fense of invalidity of patent claims is normally raised and disposed of first.  See Urquhart,

was to increase the value of taxpayer's  registered trademark  and to make more secure

competitive use of this confusingly similar mark.").
175.  See supra notes 112-16 and accompanying text.SMU LAW  REVIEW [Vol. 64
Though we cannot see, touch, or feel patents, copyrights, trademarks, and
trade secrets, they are everywhere and exist wherever the tangible or dig-
ital forms embodying them are transported and in existence.  They can be
easily duplicated,  multiplied, and distributed worldwide.
Because intellectual property depends on tangible forms for its creative
existence, an important tax issue is whether tangible medium embodying
intellectual  property should be significant in  determining  the tax treat-
ment of intellectual  property.  The government  has not always  taken a
consistent approach.
In  determining  the tax consequences  of certain  intellectual property
transactions,  the government  has largely ignored  the legal attributes  of
intellectual  property,  instead  deeming  significant  the  tangible  medium
embodying the intellectual property.  An example in which the tax treat-
ment of a transaction depends on the tangible medium embodying intel-
lectual  property  involves  the  exchange  of  intellectual  property.  As  a
general rule, the exchange of one type of intellectual property for a dif-
ferent type of intellectual property is a realization event potentially sub-
ject to taxation with the amount of gain equal to the difference between
the value of the intellectual property received and the adjusted basis of
the intellectual property  given  in the exchange.176  However,  a  special
nonrecognition  rules  applies  to  "like  kind"  exchanges  of  property.177
Specifically, no gain need be recognized if business or investment  prop-
erty is exchanged solely for property of a like kind to be held for use in
business or investment.178 Under the approach adopted by the Treasury,
whether intellectual property is of a like kind to other intellectual prop-
erty depends  not only  on  "the  nature or character  of  the [intangible]
rights involved (e.g., a patent or a copyright),  [but] also on the nature or
character  of the  underlying [tangible asset] to  which the [intellectual]
property relates."'179 Accordingly, if a taxpayer "exchanges a copyright on
a novel for a copyright on a different novel,"  then "[t]he  properties ex-
changed  are of a  like  kind."'180  On the  other hand, if  a taxpayer  ex-
changes a copyright  on a novel for a copyright  on a song,"  then "[tihe
properties exchanged  are not of a like kind."' 81
A second example is the tax treatment of software development costs.
One approach to software development costs would be to prescribe dif-
ferent tax treatments  depending  on the protection sought  (e.g.,  patent,
copyright, trade secret).  In other words, if developed software were pro-
tected as a patent, then the development costs would be treated the same
as costs of developing any patentable invention.  If, on the other hand,
the software  were protected  only as  a copyright, then the development

realized over the adjusted basis of the property transferred).

costs  would be treated  the same  as  costs  of developing  any  copyright
(e.g.,  copyrighted novel, copyrighted song).  Without clear rules, the Ser-
vice adopted a different approach-one that ignores the form of intangi-
ble intellectual protection sought and  instead focuses on the subject  of
protection.182  Under a longstanding  administrative ruling, software de-
velopment costs are treated the same  (i.e., currently deductible) regard-
less of whether  the software  is  patented, copyrighted,  or  protected by
trade secret.183
A third example  is the tax treatment of advertising expenditures that
produce  intellectual property rights of a long-term nature (e.g.,  graphic
designs, package designs).  As a general rule, the government allows tax-
payers to currently deduct advertising costs notwithstanding the fact that
advertising often produces benefits that continue well beyond the current
taxable year.184  "Only in the unusual  circumstance where advertising is
directed towards obtaining future benefits significantly beyond those tra-
ditionally  associated  with  ordinary  [product,  institutional,]  or goodwill
advertising, must the costs ...  be capitalized.''185  Advertising expendi-
tures  often create  intellectual  property rights  in  trademarks  and  trade
dress (the total image and overall appearance of a product), as such rights
are based on use in commerce and often encompass the costs of creating
copyrightable  advertising materials.  An interesting question is whether
these long-term intangible benefits should serve as the basis for requiring
capitalization  of  advertising  campaign  expenditures.  Or,  should  such
costs be deductible because they resulted from advertising activities?
In one case,186 a tax court allowed trade dress and copyright develop-
ment costs to be deducted even though  such costs in a non-advertising
context would most likely have to be capitalized.  The taxpayer incurred
substantial  costs  in  developing  an  advertising  campaign-namely  ex-
penses relating to the creation of graphic designs and package designs for
the packaging of its cigarette products-and  sought to deduct such cam-
paign expenditures.' 87  The  taxpayer  also sought to deduct  the costs  of
executing the campaign.188 Although the government  conceded that the

tion of the package."  Id. at 73.
188.  Advertising execution expenditures were defined by the Service as costs of execut-
ing the advertising campaign (e.g., costs of production of television commercials).  Id.SMU LAW REVIEW [Vol. 64
advertising execution expenses were deductible, it argued that the adver-
tising  campaign  expenditures  should be capitalized.  The government's
argument was that the campaign expenditures provided long-term bene-
fits that were not traditionally associated with ordinary business advertis-
ing.  The graphic design and package  design costs provided legal rights
and economic interests of a long-term nature-the legal rights being the
statutory rights and  common-law trademark  rights that attach to trade
dress and the economic interest being the associated brand equity.189  In
addition,  the  taxpayer  received  long-term  copyright  protection  for its
copyrightable  advertising  materials.190  The  court rejected  the  govern-
ment's argument and held that graphic and package design costs incurred
by the taxpayer were not required to be capitalized but were deductible
as ordinary product advertising.'91
In the vast  majority of cases,  the nature of the developed intangible
benefits and the length of legal protections are significant in determining
tax  results.  However,  such  legal  attributes  have  been rendered  com-
pletely irrelevant in certain contexts.  As demonstrated here, a company
must  generally  capitalize copyright  development  costs,  but it does  not
have to capitalize costs if the subject of the copyright is software or if the
copyright is the product  of advertising activities.  Relying on intellectual
property attributes in some contexts and disregarding them in others cre-
ates incoherent distinctions in tax law.
IV.  THREE GOALS OF SPECIFIC TAX RULES GOVERNING
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
Congress  began  enacting intellectual  property tax rules in the  1950s.
As a result of tax legislation over the past five decades,  the Code now
contains  several special rules that govern different  types of intellectual
property.  A few of the special provisions apply equally to a large group
of intellectual property assets.' 92  Most, however, are mutually exclusive,
governing  specific  forms  of intellectual  property. 93  In  applying  these

rules, it is helpful to understand as much as possible about why they exist
and how they fit into or conflict  with sound policy.  Here, each  of the
special rules is described in terms of its stated policy objectives.  While a
few  of the  provisions  were  designed  to  encourage  certain  intellectual
property activities, the vast majority of the special rules were enacted on
an ad hoc basis with particular tax goals in mind:  (1) to close tax loop-
holes and remove tax inequities, or (2) to simplify rules and eliminate tax
uncertainties that existed under general tax principles.
A.  SUPPORTING  INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY DEVELOPMENT  AND
ECONOMIC  GROWTH
1.  Tax Incentives for Patent Development Activities
In a few cases, special legislation was designed to support intellectual
property  growth  and incentivize  desirable  intellectual property activity.
In 1954, Congress enacted two provisions primarily to encourage research
activity  and  to stimulate  economic  growth  and  technological  develop-
ment.194  Section 174  of the Code permits taxpayers  to deduct immedi-
ately  certain  research  and  development  expenditures  that  might
otherwise have to be capitalized.195  Section 1235 provides statutory as-
surance to certain individual inventors that the sale of their patents will
qualify  for reduced  capital  gain  rates.196  More  specifically,  the special
rule guarantees capital gain rates, as opposed to higher ordinary income
tax rates, for any transfer of all substantial rights to a patent by certain
holders to unrelated parties.197 Working together, these two rules permit
an inventor to deduct research costs when incurred and then enjoy a low
194.  Id. § 174(a) (1954) (allowing taxpayers to treat research or experimental expendi-
tures as expenses not chargeable to capital account as long as those expenditures are paid
or incurred in connection with the taxpayer's trade or business); id. § 263(a)(1)(B) (provid-
ing that the capitalization rules under section 263(a) do not apply to research or experi-
mental expenditures deductible under section 174(a)).

capital gains tax on the later sale of the resulting invention.198
To encourage  firms  to actually  increase  their research  expenditures
over  time,  Congress  enacted  a  special  credit.199  The  credit  currently
found in section 41  of the Code is  incremental  in that it is equal  to a
certain percentage of qualified  research spending above a base amount,
which can be thought of as a firm's normal level of research and develop-
ment investment.2°°  The credit is temporary and has been extended more
than a dozen times since its enactment in 1981.
These three tax provisions, sections 41, 174, and 1235, clearly reflect a
policy decision to incentivize  the development of patents and patent-like
property.  Trade secrets and know-how that have potential for patentabil-
ity should fall within the scope of these incentives.  Section 174 regula-
tions define deductible  research and  experimental  expenditures broadly
to  include  all costs  incident  to  product  development  or improvement,
which includes  "any pilot model, process, formula, invention, technique,
patent, or similar property.''201  Section 1235 regulations provide that no
patent or  patent application need be currently  in  existence,  suggesting
that an inventor can receive capital gain treatment for patentable, or pat-
202
ent-like, property.
198.  A related incentive  for inventors is the exemption from the general "recapture"
rules of section 1245.  I.R.C. § 1245  (2006).  Under section 1245, any gain recognized on
the disposition of intangible personal property must be reported as ordinary income-not
capital gain-to the extent of any deductions (e.g., depreciation and amortization)  taken
with respect to the property. Id. § 1245(a)(1).  In other words, any part of the gain that is
attributable  to depreciation  or  amortization  deductions  previously  attributable  to the
transferred property must be recaptured as ordinary income and taxed at ordinary rates,
whereas any part of the gain that is attributable to economic appreciation may be taxed at
capital gains rates.  See id. Although intangible personal property is generally subject to
recapture, Newton Insert Co. v. Commissioner, 61 T.C. 570, 587 (1974), affd, 545 F.2d 1259
(9th Cir. 1976), the government has clarified in an administrative pronouncement that in-
ventions, the creation costs of which were expensed under section 174, are not subject to
section 1245 recapture,  Rev. Rul. 85-186,  1985-2  C.B. 84 (providing  that section 174(a)
deductions  need not be recaptured  as ordinary  income on later sale).  Thus, the entire
amount of gain recognized by an inventor on a later sale-gain attributable to research and
experimental costs expensed  under section 174, as well as gain attributable to true eco-
nomic appreciation in value of the invention-may receive preferential capital gains treat-
ment under section 1235.

that is a "fixed-base  percentage"  of the taxpayer's  average annual gross receipts for the
four preceding tax years.  For established firms,  the fixed-base  percentage  is generally
based on a ratio of the taxpayer's qualified research expenses to its gross receipts for years
1984 to 1988, capped at 16%.  For start-up firms, the fixed-base percentage is set at 3%
during the firm's first five tax years with spending on qualified research and gross receipts.
In no event shall the base amount be less than 50%  of the qualified research expenses for
the credit year.

2.  Tax Rules Applicable to Other Intellectual Property Development
Activities
The three tax incentives  for patents and patent-like  property do not
apply  to  other  forms  of intellectual  property, such  as  copyrights  and
trademarks. 203  While costs of developing these types of intellectual prop-
erty must generally be capitalized,204 several exceptions have been carved
out.
One exception from the capitalization requirement can be found in sec-
tion 263A(h).  That special  provision, enacted in  1988,  permits certain
freelance writers, photographers, and artists to deduct "qualified  creative
expenses" that would otherwise have to be capitalized.205 The stated pur-
pose of the exception was not to promote freelance activities but rather
to relieve writers, photographers, and artists from the burden of the capi-
talization rules, especially when their activities may not generate income
206
for years.
A second exception from capitalization pertains to advertising expendi-
tures that result in trademark  and copyright  protections.  As discussed
earlier, such costs  are currently  deductible  as  general advertising  even
though such costs provide benefits of a long-term nature.207
A  third  exception  from  the  capitalization  requirement  pertains  to
software development  costs.  Also discussed earlier, such costs  are cur-
rently deductible regardless of the type of intellectual property protection
on the software.208  It should be noted that although  these  exceptions
permit certain taxpayers to deduct actual creation and development costs
(e.g., costs of writing a book, costs of developing a package design, costs
of developing software), taxpayers are required to capitalize fees paid to
any government agency to obtain trademark and copyright protections on
the developed product.209

B.  ELIMINATING  LOOPHOLES  AND REMOVING  TAX INEQUITIES
1.  Tax Rules Governing Copyright Sales
On several  occasions,  Congress has enacted provisions to close loop-
holes or remove tax inequities that existed under general tax rules.  In the
earliest  example,  in  1950,  Congress  enacted  section  1221(a)(3)  of the
Code to close a loophole with respect to capital gain treatment on certain
copyright sales.210  Prior to the enactment of section  1221(a)(3),  the tax
treatment of a sale of a copyright depended on the professional status of
the writer, author, or photographer.  For example, if the author of a book
was a professional writer, the sale of the copyright for the book resulted
in ordinary income because inventory is not considered a "capital asset,"
a requirement  for capital gain treatment.211 If the author was an ama-
teur, however, the book was considered a capital asset, and the sale re-
sulted  in capital  gain.  To  remove  the  loophole  and  provide  uniform
ordinary income treatment for the sale of self-created property, Congress
added section  1221(a)(3)  to exclude  from the capital asset definition  a
copyright, a literary, musical, or artistic composition, or similar property
held by the creator.212  This  exclusion  created  a level  playing  field for
professional and amateur copyright creators alike.  It was also consistent
with the idea of taxing wages  and salaries as ordinary income.
Ironically, the 1950 law, which was designed to treat all copyright cre-
ators the same, was later viewed  by some-particularly members of the
country-music industry-as quite harsh to songwriters.  Because the aver-
age annual income of songwriters was quite low and often came in spurts,
some thought the taxing of gains realized from song sales should differ
from the taxing of compensation earned by wage earners.213 In response,
in 2006, Congress amended the 1950 law, creating an exception for sales
of musical compositions and copyrights in musical works.214  Under sec-
210.  See Revenue Act of 1950, Pub. L. No. 81-814, § 210, 64 Stat. 906, 933 (codified as
amended in I.R.C. § 1221(a)(3) (2006)).

such as corporations whose employees or independent contractors created the copyrights.

songs.215 Although this exception was  pushed to remove  perceived  tax
inequity  facing songwriters, it could more accurately  be viewed as a re-
sponse to assiduous lobbying efforts by the music industry.
2.  Tax Rules for Trademark and Trade Name Expenditures
To eliminate inequities facing small businesses that owned trademarks
and trade names,  Congress enacted  section 177  in  1956.216  Before  the
enactment  of section  177, expenditures  paid  in connection  with trade-
marks  and trade names, such  as legal fees, were not currently  deducti-
ble217  and  were  not  recoverable  under  early  tax  depreciation  rules
because trademarks and trade names have indeterminable useful lives.218
Certain large corporations, which had in-house legal staff handling trade-
mark  and trade  name  matters,  were  avoiding  this result  by deducting
compensation  with respect  to  these  matters because  of  difficulties  of
identification.  Smaller  companies,  which could  not  afford  to maintain
their own legal staff, had to pay outside counsel or consultants to perform
functions  related to trademarks  and trade names and  were required  to
capitalize such expenses.  Section 177 was enacted as an attempt to elimi-
nate the existing hardship and inequities facing small corporations.219  It
allowed a taxpayer to elect to depreciate over sixty months certain costs
incurred  in connection with the acquisition, protection, expansion, regis-
tration, or defense of a trademark.220
Section 177  was repealed  in 1986.221  The tax rule for trademark and
trade name  expenditures  was viewed  as inappropriate  for a number of
reasons: the possibility that large companies were finding a way to deduct
otherwise capital expenditures did not justify an amortization election for
all; a five-year amortization  only partially alleviated any unfairness;  and
there was no basis for a presumption that investment in trademarks and
trade  names  produced  social  benefits  that  market  forces  might  ade-
quately reflect.222
215.  Specifically, I.R.C. § 1221(b)(3) (2006) provides that, at the election of a taxpayer,
the section 1221(a)(1) and (a)(3) exclusions from capital asset status do "not apply to musi-
cal compositions or copyrights in musical works sold or exchanged by a taxpayer described
in [section 1221(a)(3)]".

3.  Tax Rules for Charitable Contributions of Intellectual Property
In its most dramatic effort to alleviate unfairness and close a tax loop-
hole, Congress amended on two occasions the charitable deduction rules
for  intellectual property donations.223  Since  1917,  the  government  has
provided a financial incentive for taxpayers to transfer property to chari-
ties  by  giving  taxpayers  an  immediate  tax  deduction  for  their  dona-
tions.224   Historically,  the  amount  of  the  taxpayer's  charitable
contribution deduction was the fair market value of the property contrib-
uted.225  By granting an immediate  deduction  equal  to  the fair  market
value of the donated property, the charitable deduction provided an im-
portant economic incentive for patentees, authors, and artists to donate
their patents and creative works to further the work of charitable organi-
zations.226  The deduction  served as  an important  incentive for writers,
artists, and photographers to make in-kind donations to museums, librar-
ies, universities, and other charitable organizations.227  Similarly, it was a
vital  tool for  the transfer of technology  from  research  corporations  to
research universities  and other nonprofit donees where the technologies
could be exploited properly.228
The government defined "fair market value" as "the price at which the
property would change hands between a willing buyer and a willing seller,
neither being under any compulsion to buy or sell and both having rea-
sonable  knowledge  of  relevant  facts. '229  The  government,  however,
never  fully articulated  or formalized  a  standard or approach  for deter-
mining the fair market value of donated  intellectual  property.230  As a
consequence, valuation conflicts between donors and the government in-

230.  I.R.C. § 170(c)(2)(b) (2006).20111 The History of Intellectual Property Taxation
creasingly occurred as intellectual property grew in value and the practice
of intellectual property donations also grew.231
In its first  major  attack on intellectual property donations,  Congress
took significant measures to curtail the availability of immediate tax ben-
efits for contributions of copyrights by creators.232  Section 170(e), added
by the Tax Reform  Act of 1969,  reduced the amount of the charitable
deduction  from  fair  market  value  to  the  creator's  basis  in  the  copy-
right.233 Because copyright creators typically have a zero basis, or a very
low basis,  in  their copyrighted  works, the  amendment  effectively  pre-
cluded  artists, musicians,  photographers,  and  other  copyright  creators
from enjoying any tax benefit from their charitable donations.234
The  1969 amendment impacted only copyright creators.235  It had no
effect on copyright purchasers who later donated their intellectual prop-
erty.  Similarly, the amendment had no effect on other forms of intellec-
tual property, such as  patents, trademarks,  trade names,  and computer
software.236  This created questionable distinctions in the tax system. Art
collectors and investors were entitled to deduct the fair market value of
their tangible property donations, but artists were entitled to deduct only
their basis in their donated self-created works.237 Likewise, patent devel-
opers were entitled to deduct the fair market value of their donated pat-
ents, but copyright creators were entitled to deduct only the basis in their
donated  copyrights.238  These  distinctions  remained  in  the  Code  for
thirty-five  years  until  Congress's  second  major  attack  on  intellectual
property donations in 2004.239
As patents  became increasingly  valuable  assets and patent  donations

erty, reducing the  initial  amount a  donor may  deduct.241  As with  the
1969  legislation  impacting  self-created  copyrights,  the  2004  legislation
limited the initial charitable deduction of any type of intellectual property
to the property's tax basis.242  Often the donor's tax basis in intellectual
property is very small; in many cases, the donor's basis is zero because
development  costs  are often deducted  when incurred.243 To encourage
charitable giving of intellectual property, Congress deemed it appropriate
to  grant  donors  of  intellectual  property  future  charitable  deductions
based on the income received  by the donee charity.244  Specifically, the
donor can take a deduction for up to ten years for gifts of royalty-produc-
ing intellectual property to public charities.245 The amount of the charita-

donee.246  The percentage  declines over time.247

taxpayers  and the  government arose  over  the proper  tax  treatment  of
intellectual  property development  and  acquisition costs  as well as  over
the proper tax treatment of intellectual property disposition proceeds.249
There  also  existed considerable  diversity  of opinion  among  the courts
over how to apply general tax principles to increasingly valuable intellec-
tual property assets.250  On several occasions,  Congress  enacted federal
legislation to improve clarity of tax result.251

1.  Tax Rules for Patent Development and Assignments
In the  earliest  example,  Congress  enacted in  1954  sections  174  and
1235, which helped to eliminate uncertainties over the proper tax treat-
ment of patent development costs and patent assignments.252 Section 174
allows taxpayers  to elect  to immediately  deduct  qualified research  ex-
penditures that would otherwise be capitalized.253 While the primary jus-
tification  for the special  deduction was  to encourage  new research  and
development  activity and stimulate  economic growth  and technological
development,254 another justification was to reduce uncertainties caused
by applying  the asset  capitalization  rules to  research  and development
255
activities.
Section  1235  provides  some bright-line  rules  for determining  when a
patent  transfer will qualify for reduced capital gain rates as  opposed to
ordinary  income  tax rates.256  While  it was  intended  to  encourage  re-
search and development that potentially leads to patentable inventions, it
was also an attempt to reduce uncertainty and minimize disputes over the
application of general tax principles to patent transfers.257 When applica-
ble, section 1235 provides statutory assurance that a patent transfer will
not be deemed  a license merely because of the existence  of contingent
payments.258 It eliminates uncertainty over whether a patent transferor is
an amateur, who is eligible for capital gain treatment under general tax
principles, or a professional inventor, who is not eligible for capital gain
treatment under general tax principles.259  And, it eliminates the need to
ascertain the holding period of an invention for purposes of meeting the
requisite  one-year holding period under  the general capital gain provi-

disposition of the property transferred); see also S. REP. No. 83-1622, at 422 (1954),  re-
printed in 1954 U.S.C.C.A.N. 4621, 5082 (stating that section 1235 was intended "to give
statutory assurance to certain patent holders that the sale of a patent (whether as an 'as-

that section 1235 can provide capital gains treatment to all inventors, whether amateur or
professional, regardless how often they sell their patents).SMU LAW REVIEW [Vol. 64
sions.260  If the safe harbor provision is satisfied (there exists a transfer of
"all substantial rights" by a "holder" to an unrelated party, as those terms
are defined), then a patent transferor is assured capital gain treatment.261
Determinations of what constitutes a sale under general sale or exchange
principles  and  determinations  of what  constitutes  a  capital  asset  are
therefore unnecessary.
2.  Tax Rules for Trademark and Trade Name Dispositions
Another area of the law in desperate  need of clarification  concerned
the proper tax consequences of trademark and trade name dispositions.
As discussed earlier, there was considerable  diversity of opinion among
courts over what sorts of interests retained by transferors should preclude
capital gain treatment, and there was uncertainty over the impact of con-
tingent payments in trademark and trade name transfers.262 Congress ad-
ded section 1253 in 1969 to bring clarity to this area of the law.263
First, section  1253  mandates  ordinary income  treatment  for all  pay-
ments that  are  contingent on  the productivity,  use,  or  disposition of a
trademark or trade name.264  Contingent amounts received or accrued for
the transfer of a  trademark  or  trade  name  constitute  ordinary income
regardless  of whether the transfer is in substance a  sale or a license.265
Second, section 1253 imposes ordinary income  treatment on noncontin-
gent payments  (whether up-front or installment payments) received for
the transfer  of a trademark  or trade name if the transferor retains any
significant power, right, or continuing interest with respect to the subject
matter of the mark or name.266  The Code sets forth six potentially signifi-
cant powers, any  one of which, if retained, would  require  ordinary in-
come treatment.267 This list of retained powers is not exhaustive; rather,
260.  See I.R.C. § 1222(3) (2006).  The tax treatment of a capital gain depends generally
on the property's holding period. See id. Under general characterization rules, only long-
term capital gains are accorded preferential  tax treatment.  See id. A long-term capital
gain requires a holding period of more than one year.  See id. Under the special characteri-
zation provision of section  1235, however, the actual holding period becomes  irrelevant.
See id.

264.  I.R.C. § 1253(c) (2006).
265.  A question left open by Congress is whether all payments received in a sale should
be treated as ordinary income with no basis recovery or whether the transferor should be
permitted to recover his or her basis. In other words, does section 1253 transform a trans-
action, which in form and substance is a sale, into a license?  See James 0. Tomerlin Trust
v. Comm'r, 87 T.C. 876, 892 (1986)  (holding characterization  of payments under section
1253 was inconclusive in determining whether payments were royalties for purposes of the
personal holding company tax because section 1253 does not determine whether a sale has
occurred).
266.  I.R.C. § 1253(a) (2006).
267.  Significant retained powers, rights, and interests include: the right to disapprove an
assignment; the power to terminate the transfer at will; the right to prescribe standards of
quality for the transferee using the trademark; the right to require the transferee to enter2011]

consideration is given  to all  the facts  and circumstances  existing  at the
time of a transfer to determine whether an unenumerated  power consti-
tutes a significant power.  For example, the duration of the relevant re-
striction  is  important  in  determining  whether  the  restriction  is
268
significant.
While clarifying the tax consequences to transferors of trademarks  and
trade names, Congress also, in 1969, provided a new set of tax rules for
transferees of such property.269  Section  1253 clarified  that a transferee
could deduct as  a business expense  contingent payments, i.e., payments
contingent  on the productivity,  use, or disposition of the trademark  or
trade name transferred.270  In the case of a  lump sum payment, section
1253  provided that the transferee  could amortize  the payment over the
lesser of the term of the trademark  agreement  if the agreement  had a
limited term or ten years.271  In  1989,  Congress  amended section  1253.
First, it provided that a transferee's contingent payments were deductible
only if the contingent amounts were paid as part of a series of payments
that were payable  at least annually throughout the term of the transfer
agreement, and the payments were substantially equal in amount or paya-
ble under a fixed formula.272  Second, it limited the ten-year amortization
rule for lump sum amounts to transactions in which the lump sum amount
paid for a trademark or trade name did not exceed $100,000; it also pro-
vided a new twenty-five year amortization period for fixed sum amounts
exceeding $100,000.273  In 1993, the ten-year and twenty-five-year amorti-
zation rules in section 1253 were eliminated with the enactment of section
197, which provided a fifteen-year amortization rule for capitalized trade-
an exclusive sales agreement with the transferor; the right to require that the transferee
purchase substantially all supplies and equipment from the  transferor;  and the  right to
payments contingent upon the productivity, use, or disposition of the trademark or trade
name  were such  payments are  a  substantial  element  of  the  transfer  agreement.  Id.

mark and trade name acquisition costs.274  As discussed below, the pur-
pose of section 197 and the corresponding changes to section 1253 was to
simplify  the law  and minimize  disputes  regarding  the  depreciation  of
275
intangibles.
3.  Tax Rules for Depreciating Intellectual Property Acquisition Costs
Without  doubt,  Congress's  greatest  effort  at  rule  simplification  oc-
curred in  1993  when  Congress  attempted  to  simplify  tax  depreciation
rules for intangible  property.  Under historic tax depreciation rules, the
capitalized  costs  of  acquiring  intellectual  property  could  be recovered
only if the  intellectual property  had a  limited  useful life that could  be
determined with reasonable accuracy.276 As explained earlier, there were
many problems with applying these traditional tax depreciation rules to
intellectual property.277  To address these problems and simplify the tax
treatment of intangibles, Congress enacted, in 1993, section  197.278  Sec-
tion 197 provides  a  single  depreciation  method  (straight-line  deprecia-
tion) and a single recovery period (fifteen years) for the capitalized costs
of acquiring many forms of intellectual property.279  The fifteen-year re-
covery period was not based  on any measure  of actual usefulness of in-
tangibles in a business but was chosen because it was the shortest period
that would not have a negative revenue impact.280
Section 197 provides a list of intangible property that is subject to rata-
ble, fifteen-year  depreciation.281  Specifically  mentioned is  "any  patent,
copyright, formula, process, design, pattern, know-how, format, package

279.  Specifically, section 197 provides a fifteen-year depreciation deduction for the cap-
italized costs of an "amortizable section 197 intangible," and prohibits any other deprecia-
tion or amortization deduction with respect to that property.  I.R.C. § 197(a)-(b) (2006).
Section 197 defines an "amortizable section 197 intangible" as any "section 197 intangible"
acquired after August 10, 1993, and held in connection with a trade or business or an activ-
ity conducted for profit. Id. § 197(c)(1).  Section 197 provides a list of intangible assets that
fall within the definition of "section 197 intangible"  and are subject to fifteen-year amorti-
zation.  Id. § 197(d).  Section 197 also specifically excludes certain intangible  assets,  Id.
§ 197(e).

design, computer software..,  or interest in a film, sound recording, video
tape, book,  or  other similar  property,' 282 as  well as any  trademark  or
trade name.283  Section 197  intangible  property also  includes  goodwill,
going concern value, customer lists, covenants not to compete, and a few
284
other intangibles.
Although  the  definition  of  section  197  intangibles  appears  broad
enough to encompass  nearly all forms  of intellectual property, there are
several important exceptions.  Section 197 does not apply to off-the-shelf
software.285 More importantly, though, section 197 does not apply to any
interest in a patent, patent application, copyright, or computer software
that is not acquired as part of a purchase of a trade or business.286 Trade
secrets, know-how, trademarks, and trade names are not included within
the exception for separately acquired assets.287  Thus, these forms of in-
tellectual property are subject to fifteen-year amortization under section
197 regardless of whether they were acquired as part of a trade or busi-
ness or separately.288
Interestingly,  Congress has chosen  different tax depreciation rules for
intellectual property  excluded from section  197's scope-separately  ac-
quired  patents,  separately  acquired  copyrights,  separately  acquired
software,  and off-the-shelf software.289
For patents and copyrights acquired outside the context of a business
acquisition, tax depreciation rules applicable prior to 1993 generally con-
tinue to apply.290  Thus, the capitalized costs of separately acquired pat-
ents and copyrights are recovered under one of two approaches:  (1) over
their  useful  lives  under  the  straight-line  method  or  (2)  as  income  is
earned under the income forecast method.291  In 1997, Congress codified
the income forecast method of depreciation in section 167(g) of the Code,
providing a maximum recovery period  of eleven years for income fore-
cast property.292  In 2004, Congress  amended section 167(g), limiting the

types of property for which the income forecast method may be used.293
In 2005, Congress again amended section 167(g) to provide a special rule
for applicable musical property.294  Although now expired, the provision
permitted a taxpayer to elect to ratably deduct the costs of acquiring any
musical composition or any copyright with respect to musical composition
property  over  a five-year  period  instead  of using  the  income  forecast

method.
For off-the-shelf software and software acquired outside the context of
a business acquisition, Congress created new cost recovery rules.  Under
section 167(f), which was added to the Code in 1993  along with section
197, such software is to be depreciated over 36 months using the straight-
line method.296 The justification for carving out a short three-year recov-
ery period for readily available software and separately acquired software
was that computer software differs  significantly from other forms of in-
tangibles in that its value  is ascertainable and it has a measurable useful
life.297  A lengthy fifteen-year amortization period would bear no resem-
blance to the actual useful life of software298 and would exact a penalty

§ 167(g)(6).  The income forecast method  is appropriate for these types of property be-
cause they possess unique income earning characteristics.  For instance, the income poten-
tial  of a purchased film  varies as  a direct  result of the  film's popularity;  its economic
usefulness cannot be measured adequately by the property's physical condition or by the
passage of time. See Guidance Cost Recovery Under the Income Forecast Method, 67 Fed.

section 1 .300  As a result, the cost of purchasing off-the-shelf software

can be immediately deducted rather than capitalized and amortized over
three years.301
With these enactments,  Congress dramatically  changed  the deprecia-
tion rules for acquired intellectual property.  Congress provided an arbi-
trary fifteen-year recovery period for intellectual property acquired in the
context of a business acquisition, regardless of the intellectual property's
legal life.302  And it carved out a special three-year rule for certain com-
puter  software-off-the-shelf  software  and  separately  acquired
software.303  Although Congress left the law as it was  for several other
forms  of intangible  assets,  permitting them  to be recovered  over their
useful lives under the straight-line method or over a maximum of eleven
years under the income forecast method (e.g., separately acquired patents
and separately acquired copyrights), these legislative enactments reflect a
bold attempt to provide a uniform predictable set of tax rules for depreci-
ating costs of intellectual property.304
V.  THE CURRENT TAX CODE AND  INTELLECTUAL
PROPERTY: A HARMONIOUS  EXISTENCE?
The United States has witnessed profound technological changes from
the  Industrial  Revolution  period  to  the  Digital  Age.  The  Industrial
Revolution arrived in the United States and gave birth to subsequent eras
wherein electricity switched nights to days,305 machines replaced manual
299.  The fifteen-year amortization period under section 197 would impede the ability of
United States information technologies to compete in world markets because it would ef-
fectively raise the cost of acquiring computer software by ten to fifteen percent.  Id. at 36.
Many of the competing computer software  nations already had  tax policies  in place al-
lowing for computer software to be amortized over either a three or five year period.  Id. at
36-37.  Ultimately, a fifteen year amortization period would discourage software invest-

immediately the cost of purchasing section 179 property.  Section 179 property is generally
tangible, depreciable personal property-as opposed to real property-that is acquired for
use in the active conduct of a trade or business.  I.R.C. § 179(d)(1).  Off-the-shelf software
was added to the list of qualifying property by the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief and Recon-

Traditional analogue equipment is able only to project reels of film on to
the big screen.  But digital projectors open up a range of new possibilities.
For instance, they allow exhibitors to provide video games or broadcast live
events, such as football matches or pop concerts.  They could even be used by
companies for sales demonstrations or lectures.
They also allow cinemas to become more flexible with the films they show.
A piece of celluloid for an analogue projector is heavy, unwieldy and expen-
sive to produce.  Digital films are much easier, like changing a cartridge on a
video-games [sic] console, and a fraction of the cost to produce.  For a chain
such as Cineworld, which prides itself on screening films tailored to its local
customer base, such as showing Bollywood movies in areas with large Indian
populations, it will make life much easier.

to serve as an important asset to corporate competition and growth.  For
example,  Texas  Instruments  and  IBM  changed  their  core  businesses,
moved  away  from  manufacturing  products,  and  embraced  a  licensing
model that allowed them to capitalize on their strengths based on power-
ful patent portfolios.320  Apple  changed its image of a desktop company
to  become  an  ultra-chic  company with sleek  products  and  accessories
ranging  from  computing  to  telecommunications  to  entertainment.321
Anchoring Apple are the brand name, the trade secrets, the patents, the
copyrights, and the software; they constitute the driving force for the cre-

In  another example, Microsoft  is no longer  the global  company  with

IBM set the standard for patent licensing in the early '90s.  While Big Blue
was in a steep decline, veteran employee and lawyer Marshall Phelps got the
company to raise the fees it charged others for piggybacking on its ubiquitous
technology. Phelps recalls that incoming CEO Lou Gerstner was skeptical of
the program; at RJR Nabisco, he had been involved in a patent dispute with
Procter  &  Gamble  over  soft  chocolate-chip  cookies.  Phelps  changed
Gerstner's mind by cracking open an IBM PC and showing him all the com-
ponents that came from other companies.  In other words: hardware compa-
nies were  interdependent,  and as the biggest fish  in the sea, IBM should
exploit that fact.  A few years []  later[,] IBM was raking in $2 billion a year
of almost pure profit from licensing revenue.

What is Google's cloud? It's a network made of hundreds of thousands, or by
some estimates 1 million, cheap servers, each not much more powerful than
the PCs we have in our homes.  It stores staggering amounts of data, includ-
ing numerous copies of the World Wide Web. This makes search faster, help-
ing ferret out answers to billions of queries in a fraction of a second. Unlike
many traditional supercomputers, Google's system never ages.  When its in-
dividual pieces die, usually after about three years, engineers pluck them out
and replace them with new, faster boxes. This means the cloud regenerates as
it grows, almost like a living thing.  A move towards clouds signals a funda-
mental shift in how we handle information.  At the most basic level, it's the
computing equivalent of the evolution in electricity a century ago when farms
and businesses shut down their own generators and bought power instead
from efficient industrial utilities.

While the body of intellectual property laws developed rapidly begin-
ning at the inception of the nation, income tax laws governing intellectual
property were slow to evolve.334  Indeed, until the mid-twentieth century,
the resolution of tax issues regarding intellectual property involved  the
use of existing, traditional principles of taxation equally applicable to tan-
gible property.  Specific tax rules governing intellectual property transac-
tions  developed  slowly and separately from  the body of law  governing
intellectual property rights.335 These tax rules were designed primarily to
resolve the procedural  dissonance that occurred when general principles
of  taxation  were  used  to  resolve  early  intellectual  property  tax  dis-
putes.336  Much of that dissonance in the intersection of intellectual prop-
erty  and  taxation  has  been  detected  and  addressed.  But the  ad  hoc
development of special tax rules created primarily with tax goals in mind
resulted  in  a  tax  system that does  not ideally  support  the intellectual
property system and modern trends, such as the current business practice
of integration and bundling of different types of intellectual property.
A. 
SUPPORTING  INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY'S  INNOVATION  GOALS
The policy goals of intellectual property law often emphasize two main
principles:  innovation and efficiency.  Patent and copyright laws, in gen-
eral, motivate innovation and creative activities of inventors and authors
and induce the "release  to the public of the products of [their]  creative
genius. '337  Innovation is the cornerstone anchoring the growth  and ad-
vancement of the United States.338  Trade secret protection embodies the
policy goal of innovation in addition to achieving efficiency  through re-

tion.339  Trademark  law centers  on  the facilitation  of  efficiency  in  the
marketplace for both consumers and producers of trademarked products
340
or services.
The current tax regime governing intellectual property does not ideally
support desirable intellectual property  incentives and efficiencies.  Sev-
eral current tax rules reflect a policy decision to incentivize developments
of patents and patent-like property.341 But these tax benefits are circum-
scribed in ways that undermine their utility.  For example, the section 174
deduction  for research  and  development  expenditures applies  to those
inventors  who  use or  intend to use  their research  results in a  trade  or
business.342  The deduction arguably does not apply to an inventor who
merely intends to license the results of her inventive activities for taxable
income, although a few courts have found a trade or business of inventing
and thus permitted current deductions.343
This requirement fails to recognize that, in today's innovation mar-
ketplace,  very  few  individual  inventors,  startup  companies,  and
young research entities develop  their innovations  into end products
or services  for commercial exploitation  in a  trade or business,  but
rather intend to sell or license their innovations to larger companies
looking to acquire innovations to supplement  their own research or
build promising intellectual property portfolios.344
339.  The Supreme Court has long recognized that with respect to innovations not eligi-
ble for patent protection: "Trade secret law will encourage invention in areas where patent
law does not reach, and will prompt the independent innovator to proceed with the discov-
ery and exploitation of his invention.  Competition is fostered and the public is not de-
prived of the use of valuable, if not quite patentable,  invention."  Kewanee  Oil  Co. v.

344.  See id. at 29.2011] The History of Intellectual Property Taxation
Like  the section  174  deduction  (enacted  in  1954),  the section 41  re-
search credit (enacted in 1981)  was designed to encourage  additional re-
search and development.345  As structured,  however,  the credit fails to
achieve  optimal technology  outcomes.  First, the credit's  reformulation
over the years has limited the types of research for which the credit  is
available.346  Second, the incremental  nature of the credit means many
businesses cannot make use of any of the credit, placing U.S. businesses
at a competitive disadvantage as compared to international firms entitled
to  greater  tax  incentives  in  their  countries  for  research  spending.347
Third, the temporary nature  of the credit makes  it difficult  for firms  to
plan research  activities.
The current tax incentives for patents and patent-like property do not
apply to other forms of valuable intellectual property, such as copyright-
able property and trademarks.34  As a general rule, copyright and trade-
mark development costs must be capitalized.349 Limited exceptions have
been carved  out but arguably  do not go far enough to achieve  optimal
copyright and trademark goals.353
With respect  to copyright  activities,  a special exception  in  the Code
permits freelance writers, photographers,  and authors to deduct "quali-
fied creative  expenses"  that would otherwise  have to be capitalized.351
But the exception is overly restrictive.  First, the exception is not so broad
as to include all individuals engaged in any creative activity.  Rather it is
limited to only certain individuals-writers, photographers, and artists-
as those terms are defined in the Code.352 Tax benefits for patent inven-
tors are not so restrictive;  both  individual  and  corporate inventors  are
eligible  to deduct costs  of developing or improving a product, which is
broadly defined.353  Second, the exception for freelance writers, photog-
345.  See supra notes 199-200 and accompanying text.
346.  Not  all expenditures  that qualify  for the research deduction  under  section 174
qualify for the research credit under section 41 due to special regulatory requirements and
exceptions.
347.  The credit  applies only  to qualified  research  expenditures in  excess of a base
amount that is a "fixed-base percentage" of the taxpayer's average annual gross receipts
for the four preceding tax years.  I.R.C. § 41(a), (c)(1).  For established firms, the fixed-
base percentage is generally based on a ratio of the taxpayer's qualified research expenses
to its gross receipts for years 1984 to 1988, capped at 16%.  Id. § 41(c)(3)(A).  Calculating
today's credit based on research spending relative to receipts in the years 1984-1988 does
not reflect the realities of today's economic and technological world and could penalize a
company that had high research spending levels during the 1984-1988 base period.

raphers, and authors is limited only to individuals whose activities rise to
the level of a trade or business within the meaning of the Code.354  For
example, an author may currently deduct the costs of writing a book but
only if the author has already established himself in the trade or business
of writing.  This is not a requirement for patent inventors; they only need
to show that they have the intent and capability to enter a business with
the resulting technology.355  Further, although an author may deduct the
costs of writing a book, the author cannot immediately deduct the attor-
ney's fees or fees paid to any government agency to obtain copyright pro-
tections  on the developed  product.356  Again, these rules  for attorney's
and government fees do not apply to patent inventors; the tax law is very
clear that all costs incident to the development of a patent are deductible,
including attorney's fees in the prosecution of a patent application.357
Tax rules with  respect to trademarks  are  quite  unfavorable  as  com-
pared to tax rules governing patents and arguably are in disharmony with
trademark goals in general.358  Although the advertising costs of building
up the goodwill value in trademarks are currently deductible even though
such costs provide benefits of a long-term nature, most other trademark
costs are not and must be capitalized.359  For example, the fees paid to a
government  agency  to  obtain  trademark  protections  must  be capital-
ized.360  In addition, legal fees incurred in trademark infringement actions
generally must be capitalized.361
B.  SUPPORTING  INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY  CHANGES
Special tax rules  applicable  to intellectual property reference and de-
fine specific types of intellectual property.362  For example, section 1235
of the Code applies only to "patents" as defined in the Treasury Regula-
tions  under  section  1235,363  section  1253  applies  to  "trademarks"  and
354.  I.R.C. § 263A(h)(2)(A).
355.  For research and development costs to be deductible under section 174, they must
be incurred "in connection with" the taxpayer's trade or business.  Id. § 174.  Prior to 1974,
the Service  and the courts took the position that in order to qualify for section 174 treat-
ment, a taxpayer must have already engaged in a trade or business.  Snow v. Comm'r, 482
F.2d  1029, 1031-32  (6th Cir. 1973), rev'd, 416 U.S. 500 (1974).  However, the Supreme
Court rejected this narrow approach and held that pre-operational research or experimen-
tal expenditures  could qualify for the section 174 deduction.  416 U.S. 500.  Although a
taxpayer need not be currently conducting a business, the taxpayer must, however, demon-
strate a realistic prospect of entering into a trade or business that will exploit the technol-
ogy under development.  See, e.g., Kantor v. Comm'r, 998 F.2d 1514, 1518 (9th Cir. 1993).
In making this determination, the taxpayer must demonstrate both an objective intent to
enter into the trade or business or the capability to do so.  Id.

363.  Id.2011] The History of Intellectual Property Taxation
"trade names,"  as defined for tax purposes,364 and section 197 applies to
an  enumerated  list  of  intangible  intellectual  property  assets,  each  of
which is defined for tax purposes in the Treasury Regulations.365
One problem with this asset-specific approach is that the resulting tax
regime  governing  intellectual  property  is  not  equipped  to  deal  with
emerging intangible intellectual property rights.  For example, specific tax
rules do not exist for domain names, valuable  assets that emerged  with
the arrival of global electronic commerce transactions on the internet.366
Are  domain names  mere  variations  of traditional  forms  of intellectual
property, to  which the existing tax regime  can be applied?  It could  be
argued that domain names that function as "source identifiers should be
treated under the current tax regime applicable to trademarks" but that
generic domain names  are not dealt with by the existing  tax regime.367
This  is  troublesome  in  light of the valuable  nature of generic  domain
names.  Generic domain names are easy to remember-a generic or de-
scriptive URL of a website.368  The names specify or describe the prod-
ucts or services offered at the website.369 For example, www.loans.com is
a URL for the online lending and banking services; it was purchased by
Bank  of America for $3  million.370  Such names  are generally  not pro-
tected under trademark laws because they are generic.371 Providing these
names protection would render everyone else speechless and perpetuate
364.  These terms were broadly defined in regulations that were proposed in 1971 but
eventually withdrawn  due to a sunset provision.  Prop. Treas. Reg. § 1.1253-1, -3, 36 Fed.
Reg. 13,148 (July 15,  1971), withdrawn by 58 Fed. Reg. 25,587 (Apr. 27, 1993).  The term
"trademark,"  for purposes of section 1253, was defined as "any word, name, symbol, or
device, or any combination thereof, adopted and used by a manufacturer or merchant to
identify his goods and distinguish  them from those manufactured  or sold by others."  Id.

generic names, they are valuable as domain names  or URLs for a web-
site.373  Indeed, in the early e-commerce era, internet companies paid mil-
lions of dollars  for these generic names.374  Amazingly, the intellectual
property tax regime does not specifically address these valuable assets.
Another problem with the intellectual property tax regime's asset-spe-
cific approach is that it is not equipped to tackle the increasing integra-
tion and bundling  of intellectual  property in business  practice.  Today,
many different types of intellectual property are often bundled, as many
forms  of intellectual  property  protection  are  available  for a particular
product or service.375  For example, Coca-Cola is protected by both trade
secret and trademark  laws.376
Software is  a  classic  example  of the  "bundling"  of rights  in  today's
economy.  For instance, Microsoft Windows is a set of complex software
programs and is covered by many copyrights.377 Each time a new version
of the software  is created,  there is a potential new copyright.378  Addi-
tionally, certain functions for Windows software programs are covered by

patents.379  Moreover, there is proprietary  information and know-how in
Windows  protected by trade  secret law.380  The name  "Windows"  is a
known trademark,  identifies the products widely installed in most com-
puters, and is used by millions.381 The four curving, colorful panels of the
Windows logo are also entitled to protection under trademark law.382
Likewise, in the biotech or biopharma industry, drug companies rely on
patents383 and trade secrets for the protection of their research and devel-
opment of certain drugs.384  The drug companies advertise the drugs, and
they rely on copyright, trade dress, and trademark protections  for their
various advertising campaigns.  Also, to market and sell their drugs, the
companies will use trademarks along with pamphlets and instruction.  On
a particular drug, patents, copyrights, trade secrets, and trademark rights
are bundled,  as the  drug companies  aggressively  seek protection in all
four intellectual property doctrines for their products.385
The bundling phenomenon raises the question: how should a particular
transaction  involving integrated  intellectual property  be treated for tax
purposes under  a  tax regime  that maintains  distinct rules  for  different
types of intellectual property?  An appropriate  analytical framework  is
needed  for  revising  and  crafting  tax  legislation  governing  intellectual
property, one that considers  not only intellectual property goals but also
the integrated nature of intellectual property protections in business.
VI.  CONCLUSION
The modem federal tax code does not adequately support contempo-
rary intellectual property policies and the realities of today's economy.  It
does not ideally support the innovation goals of the intellectual property
system.  And it does not adequately  recognize the evolution of intellec-
tual property, the emergence of new intellectual property forms, or mod-
ern intellectual property practices and trends, such as the integration and
bundling of different types of intellectual property in business today.  A

study of the historical  development  of the intellectual property  tax re-
gime reveals causes for the current dissonance between the tax code and
intellectual property.  As this Article establishes, the vast majority of the
specific tax  rules  governing  intellectual  property were  designed  to  en-
hance  tax efficiency  by resolving  procedural  dissonance  that  occurred
when traditional principles of taxation were used to resolve early tax dis-
putes. But the absence of an appropriate legal framework for intellectual
property tax legislation-one  that considers optimal harmonization with
the intellectual property scheme-has resulted in a tax code that is funda-
mentally  flawed.  Moving  forward,  an  appropriate  legal  framework  is
needed for tax rules-one that recognizes that tax law, as well as intellec-
tual property law, is central  to innovation.
