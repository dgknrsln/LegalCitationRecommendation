A STEP TOO FAR: MATTER OF A-B-, “PARTICULAR 
SOCIAL GROUP,” AND CHEVRON 
 
Jaclyn Kelley-Widmera1and Hillary Richa2 
 
ABSTRACT 
 
Every day, thousands of Central American asylum seekers, many fleeing 
persecution from domestic abusers and gangs, attempt to seek refuge in the 
United States. To receive asylum, those escaping such violence typically must 
show that their membership in a “particular social group” is one central 
reason for their persecution. In Matter of A-B-, issued in June 2018, then-
Attorney General Jefferson B. Sessions III restricted case law establishing 
domestic-violence-related particular social groups and attempted to destroy 
the viability of such claims altogether. As we demonstrate in this Article, this 
far-reaching decision should not receive Chevron deference from reviewing 
courts because it contravenes the intent of Congress. 
 
A-B- is concerning both for its potentially calamitous effect on individuals 
fleeing  domestic  and  gang  violence  and  for  the  abrupt,  unwarranted 
departure from established immigration law that it represents. As a result of 
A-B-, individuals, many of them women, are being subjected to both different 
and higher standards for certain aspects of their asylum claims and must “re-
invent the wheel” of establishing that domestic violence can be a basis for 
asylum.  
 
Federal  courts  reviewing  immigration  decisions  normally  apply  the 
Chevron two-step framework to review agency decisions: first, has Congress 
defined  the  term  at  issue,  or  is  it  ambiguous?  Second,  if  the  term  is 
ambiguous, is the agency interpretation of the term reasonable and therefore 
deserving of deference? Both steps of Chevron require a court to begin by 
using statutory interpretation to examine the meaning of the term. 
 
In this Article, we provide a fresh analysis of the term “particular social 
group” through statutory construction, legislative history, and international

context to find that there are some parameters around the term that are not 
ambiguous. Applying these parameters to A-B- at Chevron step one, we argue 
that A-B- is at odds with the meaning of particular social group because it 
incorrectly implies that there is a size limitation to meet the particularity 
requirement of a group, and because the decision raises the standard when 
the source of persecution is a private actor. 
 
Turning to Chevron step two, we argue that A-B- contains fundamentally 
unreasonable  interpretations  of  the  remaining  ambiguous  elements  of 
particular social group. For example, the decision contravenes the mandate 
that “particular social group” be a flexible category that can adapt to 
evolving humanitarian  concerns.  It also renounces consideration of the 
perspective  of  the  persecutor  in  defining  the  group.  In  attempting  to 
unilaterally foreclose an entire type of particular social group as a potential 
basis for asylum, Attorney General Sessions contradicts congressional intent, 
misinterprets precedent, and oversteps the discretionary authority afforded 
to the agency. Therefore, reviewing courts should not give A-B- Chevron 
deference.

Asylum seekers from Central America face innumerable hurdles in 
today’s political and legal environment. Since at least the summer of 2014,2 
such groups have been the focus of copious increasingly-restrictive policies,3

6 The United States Department of State annually publishes country-conditions 
reports for each nation. The reports for El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala—the three 
main Central American countries from which people are fleeing—describe conditions of 
severe human rights abuses and violence against women committed with impunity, in 
addition to other major humanitarian concerns. See generally El Salvador 2018 Human

seekers’ ability to receive7 or even apply for8 protection. These policies have 
increased the risks for a certain group of vulnerable asylum seekers in 
particular: those fleeing domestic violence and targeting by gangs.  
Consider,  for  example,  the  situation  of  Yessica,9  a  20-year-old 
Honduran woman who was forced by a 50-year-old gang member to be his 
“girlfriend” as he held a gun to her head. He carried a machete at all times 
and would attack her while drunk, stating that he was the boss and she had to 
obey him. Another woman, Marta, fled Guatemala after her partner raped her 
12-year-old daughter and tried to choke Marta on multiple occasions. Her 
partner told her that he would kill both Marta and her daughter, and then the 
rest of their family members, “chopping them up like salsa” if she reported 
the abuse.10  
Similar facts appear in Matter of A-B-, the June 2018 decision of then-
Attorney General Jefferson Sessions.11 A-B- is one of the most devastating 
developments in modern United States asylum law, for both its breathtaking 
reversal of protections for domestic violence survivors as well as its racist

undertones and targeted language.12 The respondent in the case, Ms. A.B., 
sought asylum in the United States after fleeing her native El Salvador to 
escape  years  of  brutal  physical,  sexual,  and  emotional  abuse  by  her 
husband.13 He frequently threatened to kill her while brandishing weapons; 
he beat her, raped her, and treated her like a slave.14 She finally fled her 
country  after  her  then  ex-husband  attacked  her  with  a  large  knife  and 
described in detail how he planned to kill her.15 An immigration judge 
initially denied Ms. A.B.’s asylum application based on a negative credibility 
finding,  which  was  overturned  by  the  Board  of  Immigration  Appeals 
(“Board”).16 The Board found that Ms. A.B. had suffered persecution on 
account of her particular social group and directed the judge to grant her 
asylum on the merits.17 During this process, Sessions certified18 the case to

the applicant in A-B- had entered the United States without inspection and chastising her and 
others for this manner of entry while also suggesting that those who enter without inspection 
are only “seeking a better life” rather than fleeing for their lives : “[a]liens seeking an 
improved quality of life should seek legal work authorization and residency status, instead 
of illegally entering the United States and claiming asylum.”).

himself for review.19 His decision ultimately denied asylum,20 overruled 
precedent establishing domestic violence as a basis for a particular social 
group,21 and also contained sweeping language raising the bar for domestic-
violence-  and  gang-based  particular  social  group  claims.22  In  dicta,23 
Sessions attempted to foreclose these claims entirely going forward, stating 
“[g]enerally,  claims  by  aliens  pertaining  to  domestic  violence  or  gang 
violence  perpetrated  by  non-governmental  actors  will  not  qualify  for 
asylum.”24  
In the wake of A-B-, former immigration judges, numerous scholars, 
activists,  politicians,  and  stakeholders  weighed  in  with  resounding 
indictments against the new decision.25 Commentators immediately predicted 
                                                 
cases). This article will not address issues with Attorney General certification with regard to 
the volatile political quagmire of immigration law, but such a discussion may arise in a future 
scholarly project.

29 We consider to be outside the scope of this Article matters of comparative law, 
such as how other countries treat asylum seekers fleeing domestic violence under the 
particular social group category. We also do not address the use of international legal theories 
of interpretation, such as the doctrine of pro homine, in our analysis. Instead, we focus solely 
on the sources we observe courts to use in their written opinions, and reserve such 
discussions for consideration later in our scholarly agenda. 
30 This is the first article to conduct the analysis at this level of detail, providing a 
concrete outline for how advocates or courts can argue for or reach the conclusion that A-B- 
does not warrant deference. Fatma Marouf noted in a recent article that A-B- should be 
reviewed under Chevron and that Attorney General’s interpretation of particular social group 
delineated in the case “may well fail that standard as arbitrary or unreasonable interpretations 
of the INA.” Becoming Unconventional: Constricting the “Particular Social Group” 
Ground for Asylum, 44 N.C. J. INT’L L. 487, 512 (2019) [hereinafter Marouf, Becoming 
Unconventional]. This Article explains why A-B- is in fact unreasonable.  
 
Further, we build on the work of scholars who have analyzed “particular social group” 
and called for solutions to clarifying the term. E.g. Liliya Paraketsova, Why Guidance from 
the Supreme Court is Required in Redefining the Particular Social Group Definition in 
Refugee Law, 51 U. Mich. J. L. Reform 437, 449 (2018) (discussing the general history of 
the term in international and domestic law and calling for the Supreme Court to “provide 
detailed guidance for the BIA to revise the PSG definition to one that removes the 
particularity requirement and changes the social distinction requirement into a flexible 
standard”); Rachel Gonzalez Settlage, Rejecting the Children of Violence: Why U.S. Asylum 
Law Should Return to the Acosta Definition of a “Particular Social Group”, 30 GEO. INT’L 
L. REV. 287, 298 (2016) (arguing that the Board improperly limited the definition of 
particular social group through adding additional factors); Kristen Armstrong, A Deferential 
Crisis: The Board of Immigration’s Chevron Struggle Concerning Refugee Principles, 52 
Suffolk L. Rev. 273 (2019)(arguing that the current definition of particular social group, 
including the factors of particularity and social distinction, does not deserve Chevron 
deference, but not addressing A-B- specifically); Claudia B. Quintero, Ganging Up on 
Immigration Law: Asylum Law and the Particular Social Group Standard – Former Gang 
Members and Their Need for Asylum Protections, 13 U. Mass. L. Rev. 192, 223 (2018) 
(arguing that the Board’s interpretation of particular social group is arbitrary and capricious, 
particularly with respect to gang members’ asylum claims.). 
 
Other scholars have considered A-B- from a variety of angles, including Erin Corcoran, 
The Construction of the Ultimate Other: Nationalism and Manifestations of Misogyny and 
Patriarchy in U.S. Immigration Law and Policy, 20 GEO. J. GENDER & L. 541, 572 (2019)

being denied asylum); Vogel, supra note 25 at 349-50 (critiquing the decision for its failure 
to understand intimate partner violence and suggesting legislative reforms). This Article does 
not address A-B-’s problematic construction of gender and violence. 
 
Additionally, scholars have discussed the lack of a functioning legal schema for 
protecting victims of gender-based violence in the asylum context even before A-B-. E.g.

Social Group” And Its Potential Impact on Asylum Claims Related to Sexual Orientation 10  A STEP TOO FAR  [17-Jul-19

Reviewing courts must determine whether an agency decision should get 
deference under the two-step analysis first introduced in Chevron U.S.A., Inc. 
v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.32 Courts33 and scholars alike34 
generally accept the theory that the Chevron analytical framework applies to 
Board of Immigration Appeals (Board) decisions. The Supreme Court has 
suggested  that  Board  decisions  resolving  statutory  ambiguities  should 
                                                 
and Gender, 27 YALE L.& POL’Y REV. 47, 96-97 (2008) (explaining why most domestic-
violence claims would fail the Board’s social visibility test); Sarah Rogerson, Waiting for

developed inconsistently, and in some instances this has led to the deprivation of much 
needed protection to victims of gender-based harms.”) This issue is not a subject of this 
Article, but we acknowledge that it is a critical problem directly implicated by A-B-. 
31 Congress has delegated the authority to administer immigration law to the 
Attorney General, and Board of Immigration Appeals and Attorney General certification 
cases are not subject to review by a higher administrative tribunal. See Vogel, Critiquing 
supra note 25 349-50 (explaining that the Board of Immigration Appeals is the highest 
administrative body in the immigration court system, and Circuit Courts of Appeal have de 
novo review over questions of law); see also Liliya Paraketsova, Why Guidance from the 
Supreme Court is Required in Redefining the Particular Social Group Definition in Refugee 
Law, 51 U. Mich. J. L. Reform 437, 449 (2018) (“[a]ppeals from the BIA go up to the relevant 
circuit court that the Immigration Judge sits in.”). 
32 467 U.S. 837 (1984). The Supreme Court held that where Congress has left a 
policy question ambiguous, courts should generally defer to the decisions of an executive 
agency charged with administering a statutory scheme.  
33 See, e.g., INS v. Aguirre-Aguirre, 526 U.S. 415, 424 (1999) (“[i]t is clear that the 
principles of Chevron deference are applicable to [the immigration] statutory scheme”); 
Negusie v. Holder, 555 U.S. 511, 517 (2009) (Chevron application to immigration agency

Grace v. Whitaker, 344 F.Supp.3d 96, 121 (D.D.C. 2018) (applying the “familiar Chevron 
framework” to A-B-). 
34 See, e.g., Marouf, Becoming Unconventional, supra note 30 at 512 (assuming 
Board interpretations of the INA should be reviewed under Chevron); Rachel Gonzalez

some scholars argue that it is time to revisit this assumption in light of 
intervening doctrinal development, the nature of Refugee Act cases, and 
international  human  rights  obligations.36  Further,  some  Supreme  Court 
justices  have  signaled  increasing  reluctance  to  agency  interpretations.37 
Building on this opening, we consider anew both the first step of Chevron—
the question of whether Congress has spoken on the matter—to assess the 
term “particular social group.” We then proceed under the framework of 
Chevron’s second step—whether the court should defer to the agency’s 
interpretation—and conclude that A-B- should not be given deference. 
  Part I provides an overview of the international and domestic origins 
of the key term “particular social group” and details precedent interpreting 
that  term,  including  A-B-.  Part  II  explains  the  basics  of  the  Chevron 
framework and conducts a detailed analysis of the meaning of the term 
“particular social group” through the lens of statutory analysis, including the 
textualist  canons  of  construction  and  the  purposivist  considerations  of 
legislative history and statutory context. Part III employs step one of the 
Chevron  framework  to  show  how  A-B-  contravenes  the  unambiguous 
parameters of particular social group and should not receive deference at this 
step. Part IV turns to Chevron step two to argue that Sessions’ interpretation

I.  BACKGROUND 
 
A.  Asylum Law and “Particular Social Group” 
 
We begin with a brief overview of asylum law and the international 
origin  of  the  refugee  definition.  Because  immigration  law  is  extremely 
complex,38 and because many scholars have provided excellent outlines of 
different areas within immigration law,39 we focus our explanation on only 
the  most  relevant  background  for  our  analysis.  Below,  we  discuss 
international and domestic background of the refugee definition, with an 
especial focus on the term at issue in A-B-and the subject of the analysis in 
this Article: particular social group.40 
The United States incorporated the modern refugee definition into 
domestic law following the model of the United Nations 1951 Convention 
                                                 
38 “Immigration law presents special complexities. The sheer size and chaotic layout 
of the principal statute and related sources of law bewilder specialists and nonspecialists 
alike.” Stephen H. Legomsky, Restructuring Immigration Adjudication, 59 DUKE L. J. 1635, 
1637 (2010).

40 Although A-B- at times uses the phrase “membership in a particular social group,” 
for purposes of this paper, we have isolated the term to “particular social group” as a distinct 
analytical matter. A court making an asylum decision typically must first determine whether 
the “particular social group” is cognizable, and then determine whether the applicant in a 
member of that group.  
 
We also note that the 1967 Protocol from which Congress drew the refugee 
definition uses the phrase “membership of a particular social group” (emphasis added).. 17-Jul-19]  A STEP TOO FAR  13 
Relating to the Status of Refugees (Refugee Convention)41 and 1967 Protocol 
relating to the Status of Refugees (1967 Protocol).42 Reeling from the refugee 
crisis in the aftermath of World War II, the United Nations’ Economic and 
Social Council had created the Ad Hoc Committee on Statelessness and 
Related  Problems  to  develop  a  system  to  protect  the  human  rights  of 
displaced populations.43 Composed of government representatives from 13 
states, including the United States, the Committee began crafting the refugee 
definition at its first meeting.44 Ultimately, this definition was incorporated 
into  the  Refugee  Convention’s  Article  1A45  as  the  first  internationally-
recognized  definition  of  a  refugee.46  The  1967  Protocol  adopted  the 
Convention’s refugee definition while removing some of its limitations to 
make the Convention’s provisions applicable to new refugees.47 The refugee 
definition encompassing protections for particular social groups represents a 
near-universal  consensus48  in  international  law,  with  148  state  party 
signatories to either the Refugee Convention or its implementing Protocol, 
including the United States.49

sign the 1967 Protocol. 14  A STEP TOO FAR  [17-Jul-19 
 
Although  the  United  States  first  attempted  to  create  a  robust 
immigration system through the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) of 
1952,50 the U.S. refugee definition, drawn from international law, did not 
appear in its current form until the Refugee Act of 1980.51 To address the 
discriminatory policies52 and procedural shortcomings of the 1952 INA, in 
late 1978, Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Chairman of the Senate Judiciary 
Committee, initiated consultations between congressional committee staff 
and the executive branch to revise the Act.53 The result of these collaborations 
was  ultimately  the  passage  of  the  Refugee  Act  of  1980,  substantially 
amending the INA. The Refugee Act defines a refugee as  
any person who is outside any country of such person’s nationality 
or, in the case of a person having no nationality, is outside any country 
in which such person last habitually resided, and who is unable or 
unwilling to return to, and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or 
herself of the protection of, that country because of persecution or a 
well-founded  fear  of  persecution  on  account  of  race,  religion, 
nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political 
opinion . . .54 
 
The Refugee Act plucked most of this definition directly from the 1951 
Refugee Convention and 1967 Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees,55

events occurring before 1 January 1951 and owing to well-founded fear of being persecuted 
for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political 
opinion, is outside the country of his nationality and is unable or, owing to such fear, is 
unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country; or who, not having a nationality 
and being outside the country of his former habitual residence as a result of such events, is 
unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to return to it. In the case of a person who has 
more than one nationality, the term ‘the country of his nationality’ shall mean each of the 
countries of which he is a national, and a person shall not be deemed to be lacking the 
protection of the country of his nationality if, without any valid reason based on well-founded 
fear, he has not availed himself of the protection of one of the countries of which he is a 
national.”) 17-Jul-19]  A STEP TOO FAR  15 
which explicitly include membership in a particular social group as a ground 
for asylum.56  
Congress’s adoption of the international definition of a refugee was 
widely  applauded  by  both  political  branches.57  For  example,  in  his 
conference report on the Refugee Act, Senator Edward Kennedy noted this 
change would “make our law conform to the United Nations Convention and 
Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees, which we signed in 1969[]”58 
and deemed it a significant accomplishment, described in the report as “one 
of the most important achievements of this Act[.]”59 According to the House 
Committee on the Judiciary, “[a]ll witnesses appearing before the Committee 
strongly endorsed the new definition” for its conformity to international 
standards.60 Likewise, the Department of Justice itself testified before the 
Committee that it “favor[ed] the broadening of the refugee definition” as 
Congress had done.61  
In addition to international law and the domestic law incorporating it, 
the term “particular social group” developed further through guidance from 
the  United  Nations  High  Commissioner  for  Refugees  (UNHCR).62  The 
UNHCR  functions  as  the  “administrative  body  for  the  Refugee 
Convention”63 and publishes guidelines to serve as “legal interpretative 
guidance for governments,” among other actors.64 In addition to reiterating 
                                                 
56 See, e.g., S. REP. NO. 96-212, at 3756 (1980) (comments of Senator Kennedy). 
57 Indeed, even skeptics of the entire Act itself approved of this change to 
conformity with international law. See, e.g., 125 CONG. REC. 37,201 (1979) (Although 
Representative Fascell criticized other parts of the Act, he “applaud[ed] the inclusion of the 
internationally accepted definition of ‘refugee’ in section 201(a).”). 
58 Although it is unclear from Senator Kennedy’s comment, the United States has 
signed the 1967 Protocol, not the 1951 Refugee Convention itself, although becoming a 
signatory to the Protocol effectively incorporates the provisions of the actual Convention.  
59 S. REP. NO. 96-212, at 3,756–57 (1980) (Conf. Rep.) Similarly, speaking on the 
alignment  of  the  U.S.  and  international  refugee  definitions  in  a  hearing  with  the 
Subcommittee on International Operations, Representative Fascell stated “I am not sure that 
this will solve all the problems, but we hope that is will make some progress.” The Refugee

B.  Precedent Interpreting “Particular Social Group” 
 
Initially  an  underused  ground  for  asylum,  asylum  seekers  have 
increasingly presented claims of persecution based on their membership in a 
particular social group.69 But courts have struggled to define its meaning.70 
The particular social group’s ambiguity is arguably a strength; indeed, “one 
major advantage of the social group criterion is seen to lie in its subtle 
character, which allows types of groups which are presently unknown, or not 
yet in existence, to be covered. The social group category is, thus, understood 
to constitute a dynamic category, open to future developments.”71 Yet a 
ground for asylum that is too vague to be administrable loses its utility and 
becomes vulnerable to misinterpretation, as occurred in A-B-. Therefore, it is 
necessary to discern any established or indicated meaning of particular social 
group to properly apply it.  
The Board made its first attempt to define a particular social group in 
Matter of Acosta in 1985, five years after the Refugee Act.72 In this seminal 
case, the Board recognized the phrase’s inherent ambiguity in evaluating the 
claim of a Salvadoran asylum seeker claiming persecution based on his 
                                                 
69 See Matter of M-E-V-G, 26 I&N Dec. 227, 231 (BIA 2014) (“At the time we 
issued Matter of Acosta, only 5 years after enactment of the Refugee Act of 1980, relatively 
few  particular  social  group  claims  had  been  presented  to  the  Board.”);  ANDREAS

70 See, e.g., Matter of Acosta, 19 I&N Dec. 211 (BIA 1985) (holding Salvadoran 
taxi drivers did not constitute a particular social group because occupation as a taxi driver 
was not an immutable characteristic); Matter of Toboso-Alfonso, 20 I&N Dec. 819 (BIA 
1994)  (holding  homosexuals  in  Cuba  constitute  a  particular  social  group  because 
homosexuality is an immutable characteristic); Matter of Kasinga, 21 I&N Dec. 357 (BIA 
1996) (holding “young women of the Tchamba-Kunsuntu Tribe who have not had FGM 
[female genital mutilation], as practiced by that tribe, and who oppose the practice” constitute 
a particular social group because each component of that group’s formulation is fundamental 
and the alien should not be required to change it); Matter of C-A-, 23 I&N Dec. 951 (BIA 
2006) (holding “former noncriminal drug informants working against the Cali drug cartel” 
did not constitute a particular social group because it lacked social visibility); Matter of A-
M-E-, 24 I&N Dec. 69 (BIA 2007) (holding “wealthy Guatemalans” did not constitute a 
particular social group because it lacked social visibility); Matter of L-E-A-, 27 I&N Dec. 
40 (BIA 2017) (holding that, in certain circumstances, members of an immediate family may 
constitute a particular social group because it is sufficiently distinct).

membership in a particular social group of taxi drivers.73 Applying ejusdem 
generis,74 the Board examined the other four enumerated statutory grounds 
and determined that, like those with religious affiliations or political opinions, 
members of a particular social group share “an immutable characteristic: a 
characteristic that either is beyond the power of an individual to change or is 
so fundamental to individual identity or conscience that it ought not be 
required to be changed.”75 
The  Board  in  Acosta  interpreted  the  immutable  characteristic 
expansively, explaining it may “be an innate one such as sex, color, or kinship 
ties, or in some circumstances it might be a shared past experience . . . .”76 
Indeed, the  Board  explicitly declined to  enumerate specific  groups that 
qualify under the statute, but rather emphasized the need for case-by-case 
determinations of asylum claims.77 This concrete yet open framing of a 
particular social group has been widely accepted by scholars, international 
courts, and all U.S. domestic circuit courts.78 
But  subsequent  cases  muddied  the  waters.  While  avowing  its 
continued adherence to Acosta—which was the definitive rule on particular 
social  group  for  over  20  years—the  Board  introduced  the  additional 
requirements of “particularity” and “social visibility” with Matter of C-A- in 
2006.79  In  subsequent  cases  regarding  the  relationship  between  gang 
membership and particular social group, the Board attempted to clarify these 
terms: particularity requires the group to be defined with sufficient distinction 
to be recognized by society “as a discrete class of persons,”80 whereas social 
visibility concerns “the extent to which members of a society perceive those

grounds by Matter of Mogharrabi, 19 I&N Dec. 439 (BIA 1987). Before undertaking this 
analysis, the Board also noted the lack of a clear definition from Congress and that “[a] purely 
linguistic analysis” does not resolve the phrase’s ambiguity, but rather “suggests that it may 
encompass persecution seeking to punish either people in a certain relation, or having a 
certain degree of similarity to one another or people of like class or kindred interests, such 
as shared ethnic, cultural, or linguistic origins, education, family background, or perhaps 
economic activity.” Id. at 223–33.

with the characteristic in question as members of a social group.”81 But 
instead of providing clear, workable guidance for application of the particular 
social group term, these cases garnered further confusion among the circuit 
courts.82  For  example,  the  courts  debated  whether  “social  visibility” 
constituted “a literal, ‘on-sight’ requirement.”83 The First, Second, Fourth, 
Sixth,  Eighth,  Tenth,  and  Eleventh  Circuits  all  adopted  C-A-’s  new 
particularity and social visibility factors applied in conjunction with the 
Acosta immutable characteristics test, whereas the Third and Seventh Circuits 
rejected the two new requirements.84 
The  particular  social  group  analysis  was  further  complicated  by 
Matter of R-A- and its convoluted procedural history.85 In the first Board case 
to tackle domestic violence, the Immigration Judge initially granted the 
applicant asylum based on persecution for her membership in the particular 
social group “Guatemalan women who have been involved intimately with 
Guatemalan male companions, who believe that women are to live under 
male domination.” 86 The Board reversed, reasoning that Guatemalans would 
not perceive such a group in their society and continuing that the applicant 
also failed to demonstrate sufficient nexus.87 Then-Attorney General Janet 
Reno vacated the Board’s decision and remanded pending a final rule on 
persecution.88 When later Attorney General Michael Mukasey ordered the 
Board to reconsider the case, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) 
stipulated  the  applicant’s  eligibility  for  asylum,  and  her  petition  was 
granted.89 As a result, the requisite particular social group analysis remained 
nebulous.   
In 2014, the Board sought to resolve this ambiguity and clarify its

of W-G-R-,91 a pair of companion cases.92 According to the Board in these 
cases, the new requirements of particularity and social distinction were 
consistent with Acosta93 and constituted a “subtle shift” rather than “a radical 
departure” from earlier cases.94 In line with precedent, Acosta’s immutable 
characteristic  test  remains  essential  to  the  analysis.95  The  Board  also 
reiterated that the phrase “particular social group” must be interpreted in

91 Matter of W-G-R-, 26 I&N Dec. 208 (BIA 2014). 
92 We pause to note that many scholars have critiqued M-E-V-G- and W-G-R- for 
their incompatibility with international standards and for placing an additional hurdle on 
asylum seekers attempting to rely on the particular social group ground. For instance, the 
UNHCR itself submitted an amicus brief in Matter of M-E-V-G- criticizing the particularity 
and social distinction requirements as inconsistent with its guidance. Brief for UNHCR as 
Amicus Curiae Supporting Applicant, Matter of M-E-V-G-, 26 I&N Dec. 227 (BIA 2014) at 
7. Moreover, scholars have noted that, after M-E-V-G- and W-G-R-, an asylum seeker 
presenting  particular  social  group  claim  has  “the  additional,  confounding  task  of 
demonstrating that their claimed ground is cognizable under the Immigration and Nationality 
Act . . . .  If she formulates her group broadly, she may run afoul of particularity as a court 
will find that the proposed group does not have clear boundaries or that it is over-inclusive. 
If she formulates it too narrowly, the group may lack distinction, and a court will find that 
she has offered an ad hoc description of people in her particular situation, but not of a group 
recognized in her society.” Bernardo M. Velasco, Who Are the Real Refugees: Labels as 
Evidence of a Particular Social Group, 59 ARIZ. L. REV. 235, 237, 252–53 (2017); see also

298 (2016) (arguing that the Board improperly limited the definition of particular social 
group by adding particularity and social distinction). Regardless, even accepting M-E-V-G- 
and W-G-R- as good law, Matter of A-B- goes beyond the scope of these precedent cases, as 
discussed below. 
93 Matter of M-E-V-G-, 26 I&N Dec. 227, n. 9 (BIA 2014) (“Our decision in this 
case is not a new interpretation, but it further explains the importance of particularity and

Initially, however, the Third Circuit disagreed; this case was the Third Circuit’s second 
remand of Valdiviezo-Galdamez v. U.S. Attorney General, 502 F.3d 285 (3d Cir. 2007). In 
fact, initially, the Third Circuit found the new requirements “inconsistent with prior Board 
decisions,” accused the Board of failing to provide a “principled reason’” for the change, and 
determined the Board’s decision thus was not entitled to Chevron deference. Matter of M-E-
V-G-, 26 I&N Dec. 227, 292 (BIA 2014) (citations removed). However, several circuit courts 
have granted Chevron deference to these classifications. See, e.g., Reyes v. Lynch, 842 F.3d

accordance with the other grounds of asylum, explaining that “the proper 
interpretation of the phrase can only be achieved when it is compared with 
the other enumerated grounds of persecution . . .  and when it is considered 
within the overall framework of refugee protection.”96 Overall, the Board 
confirmed its three criteria for a viable particular social group: a group must 
be  “(1)  composed  of  members  who  share  a  common  immutable 
characteristic, (2) defined with particularity, and (3) socially distinct within 
the society in question.”97 
In these companion cases, the Board also defined the supplemental 
requirements to Acosta. Particularity, the Board explained, sets the “outer 
limits” as a benchmark for who falls into the group, preventing a particular 
social  group  from  becoming  “amorphous,  overbroad,  diffuse,  or 
subjective.”98  Additionally,  the  Board  clarified  that  the  term  “social 
visibility” was not meant to refer to the literal “ocular” ability to observe a 
trait by looking at a person.99 The Board renamed this concept “social 
distinction”  to  capture  the  question  of  “whether  those  with  a  common 
immutable characteristic are set apart, or distinct, from other persons in 
society in some significant way.”100 
  Moreover,  beyond  elaborating  upon  particularity  and  social 
distinction, M-E-V-G- and W-G-R- offered further guidance for evaluating 
future particular social group claims. First, suffering persecution may be a 
factor in analyzing a viable particular social group. Although “a social group 
cannot be defined exclusively” by its members’ experience of persecution, the 
persecution “may be relevant, because it can be indicative of whether society 
views the groups as distinct.”101 Importantly, the fact that a group shares a 
trait of persecution does not invalidate the group, provided its members have 
another immutable characteristic in common.102 Second, under the Board’s 
articulated particular social group standard, particular social group claims 
related to gang activity remain viable. The Board was clear that its precedent 
“should not be read as a blanket rejection of all factual scenarios involving 
gangs.”103 Widespread violence and the prevalence of gang activity does not 
foreclose an otherwise valid claim; accordingly, 
[w]hile persecution on account of a protected ground cannot be 
inferred merely from acts of random violence and the existence of 
civil strife, it is clear that persecution on account  of a protected

on account of a protected ground. 
 
Therefore, M-E-V-G- and W-G-R- effectively added more structure to the 
criteria of Acosta104 while maintaining the requirement of case-by-case basis 
determinations of claims, even in the context of gang-related violence. 
  Six months after M-E-V-G- and W-G-R-, the Board in Matter of A-R-
C-G- granted an applicant asylum based on her membership in the particular 
social group “married women in Guatemala who are unable to leave the 
relationship.”105 Focusing on gender as a common immutable characteristic 
per Acosta, the Board reasoned that the group was particular because each 
term had “commonly accepted definitions within Guatemalan society” and 
was  socially  distinct  because  Guatemalan  society  “makes  meaningful 
distinctions”  based  on  that  immutable  characteristic.106  In  making  this 
determination,  the  Board  relied  on  the  respondent’s  experiences,  State 
Department Country Reports on Guatemala, and news articles.107 Although 
the DHS conceded this particular social group was cognizable and the Board 
agreed, four years later, A-B- would argue otherwise.

On  March  7,  2018,  then-Attorney  General  Sessions  invoked  his

At issue in the case was the narrow question of the viability of the particular 
social group “Salvadoran women who are unable to leave their domestic 
relationships where they have children in common” with their partner.110 
However,  Sessions  expanded  the  scope  of  the  question  relevant  to 
certification far beyond the issue the parties had initially litigated,111 asking 
“whether, and under what circumstances, being a victim of private criminal

Despite  previous  cases’  recognition  of  persecution  by  domestic

perform the necessary analysis and apply the appropriate standards to reach 
that  conclusion.114  To  Sessions’  understanding,  the  Board  in  A-R-C-G- 
recognized private violence as a new category of potential social group 
claims in contravention of precedent.115 In dicta, Sessions opined that victims 
of private violence will rarely be able to demonstrate that the government 
condoned the actions of private individuals or was completely helpless to 
protect victims.116  
Furthermore,  Sessions  reasoned  that  police  in  certain  countries 
struggle to respond to certain crimes, and thus many individuals will fit these 
“new” groups consisting of victims of private violence.117 Because victims 
of gangs and domestic violence may potentially constitute large groups, 
Sessions considered it unlikely that particular social groups based on these 
types of persecution will be sufficiently particular.118 Moreover, Sessions 
emphasized that the experience of persecution is irrelevant to the particular 
social group analysis.119 As such, according to Sessions, victims of private 
violence  “generally”  will  not  qualify  for  asylum.120To  justify  his 
interpretation,  Sessions  cited  Chevron,  claiming  his  “reasonable 
construction” of the membership particular social group was entitled to 
deference.121

Sessions elaborated that the Supreme Court has “also made clear that administrative agencies 
are not bound by prior judicial interpretations of ambiguous statutory interpretations, because 
there is ‘a presumption that Congress, when it left ambiguity in a statute meant for 
implementation by an agency, understood that the ambiguity would be resolved, first and 
foremost, by the agency, and desired the agency (rather than the courts) to possess whatever 
degree of discretion the ambiguity allows.’ Matter of R-A-, 24 I&N Dec. 629, 631 (A.G.

  II.  INTERPRETING PARTICULAR SOCIAL GROUP THROUGH THE TRADITIONAL 
TOOLS OF STATUTORY CONSTRUCTION 
 
In this Part, we provide an overview of the Chevron framework we 
will use to determine whether Matter of A-B- merits Chevron deference from 
a reviewing court, as Sessions claimed. To conduct step one and step two of 
the test, we must first analyze “particular social group,” a phrase that many 
courts and commentators have found to be ambiguous.122 To provide a 
comprehensive analysis of the statutory term at issue, this Part examines both 
the statute’s text and the legislative purpose, drawing upon the many tools of 
statutory construction:123 textualist tools of ordinary meaning and applicable 
interpretive canons, and purposivist tools of legislative history and statutory 
context.124 These tools offer helpful guidance to determine the meaning 
behind particular social group, its consequent application, and the amount of 
ambiguity actually in the statute. We find that, using the traditional tools of 
statutory construction, we can glean certain definitive parameters around the 
term. In addition, we flesh out remaining ambiguities in the term using 
legislative history, international sources, and past agency practice that help 
to shape what Congress meant by this term. 
 
A.  Chevron Framework 
 
                                                 
122  See,  e.g.,  GUY  S.  GOODWIN-GILL  &  JANE  MCADAM,  THE  REFUGEE  IN 
INTERNATIONAL LAW 30 (Oxford Univ. Press, ed., 1983) (recognizing there is limited 
international interpretive jurisprudence); see also Matter of M-E-V-G, 26 I&N Dec. 227, 230 
(BIA 2014) (describing particular social group, which is not defined in the Immigration and 
Nationality Act, the 1951 Refugee Convention, or its 1967 Protocol Relating to the Status of 
Refugees, as “"ambiguous and difficult to define.”) (citations omitted); see also Valdiviezo-
Galdamez v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 663 F.3d 582, 594 (3d Cir. 2011) (labeling particular social 
group as “elusive”); see also Fatin v. INS, 12 F.3d 1233, 1238 (3d Cir. 1993) (“Read in its 
broadest literal sense, the phrase [membership in a particular social group] is almost 
completely open-ended.”); see also supra Part II, Section C, summarizing precedent that 
analyzes this term. 
123 There is Supreme Court precedent for applying the tools of statutory construction 
to asylum law. In INS. v. Cardoza-Fonseca, Justice Stevens’s majority opinion used a 
plethora of statutory construction techniques, examining the text’s history, plain meaning, 
legislative record, and UNHCR policy guidance to inform the Court’s reading of the refugee 
definition.  480  U.S.  421  (1987).  More  broadly,  statutory  construction  is  particularly 
important for the human rights statutes generally as “the critical battleground for most human 
rights issues in the United States.” WILLIAM N. ESKRIDGE, JR., DYNAMIC STATUTORY 
INTERPRETATION 8 (Harv. Univ. Press eds., 1994). 
124  VALERIE  C.  BRANNON,  CONG.  RES.  SERV.,  R45153,  STATUTORY 
INTERPRETATION: THEORIES, TOOLS, AND TRENDS n. 188 (2018). Additionally, judicial 
precedent, another tool of statutory construction, is discussed supra Part II, section C. 17-Jul-19]  A STEP TOO FAR  25 
In A-B-, Sessions invoked Chevron to justify the new restrictions he 
placed on membership in a particular social group.125 To determine whether 
A-B- deserves such deference by a reviewing court, we first describe the 
Chevron principles that courts use to make this determination.126 
Courts frequently use the Chevron framework to assess whether an 
agency’s  interpretation  of  a  statutory  term  is  permissible.127  The 
Administrative  Procedures  Act  incorporated  this  judicial  oversight  role, 
requiring courts to determine whether agencies’ statutory interpretations are 
unlawful or “in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations.”128 
The court should set aside an interpretation that goes beyond the bounds of 
law.129  
In Chevron, the Supreme Court developed a method to discern those 
bounds more precisely. When analyzing the agency’s interpretation, a court 
asks two questions.130 The first question, commonly called “step one,” is “the 
question whether Congress has directly spoken to the precise question at 
issue.”131 If the intent of Congress is clear and unambiguous, the court and 
the agency must follow such intent.132  
The second question, commonly called “step two,” arises only if “the 
court determines Congress has not directly addressed the precise question at 
issue.”133 If the statute is ambiguous, the court should not “impose its own 
construction on the statute.”134 Rather, the court should evaluate the agency’s 
interpretation  of  the  ambiguous  provision  and  determine  whether  that 
                                                 
125 Matter of A-B-, 27 I&N Dec. 316, 326–27 (AG 2018) (citing Chevron and 
stating “The Attorney General’s reasonable construction of an ambiguous term in the Act, 
such as ‘membership in a particular social group,’ is entitled to deference.”). 
126Although this framework indisputably still applies, we note that the Chevron 
doctrine is in a time of possible flux. See supra note 37 (citing Paul Daly).  
127 RICHARD J. PIERCE, ET. AL., ADMINISTRATIVE LAW AND PROCESS 399 (5th ed. 
2009)(“[t]he Court has applied the Chevron two-step in over one hundred cases decided since 
1984, and circuit courts have applied it in thousands of cases.”).

129  VALERIE C. BRANNON  AND JARED P. COLE, CONG. RES. SERV., R44954, 
CHEVRON DEFERENCE: A PRIMER 1 (2017). 
130 In later cases, the Court added a Chevron “step-zero” to determine if Congress 
has delegated to the agency the authority to speak with the force of law. Cass R. Sunstein, 
Chevron Step Zero, 92 VA. L. REV. 187, 191 (2006); see also United States v. Mead Corp., 
533 U.S. 218, 226–27 (2001) (“Chevron deference [applies] when it appears that Congress 
delegated authority to the agency generally to make rules carrying the force of law, and that 
the agency interpretation claiming deference was promulgated in the exercise of that 
authority.”). Because the Attorney General’s ability to make rules with the force of law is 
not a question in this case, we do not undertake apply step zero to our analysis.

134 Id. 26  A STEP TOO FAR  [17-Jul-19 
interpretation is a permissible construction of the statute.135  
Step one. To elaborate, in its first step, the court looks to whether 
Congress has already provided the meaning of the term at issue or restrained 
the agency’s power to regulate.136 To make this determination, Chevron 
requires the court to use “traditional tools of statutory construction.”137  
The tools of statutory construction provide invaluable guidance to 
understanding potentially unclear statutory phrases. Statutory construction 
has been long and widely used138 even before Chevron to ascertain the 
meaning of statutes139 when a straightforward reading of the text proves 
insufficient.140 There are a variety of statutory construction tools at the

137 Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, 467 U.S. 837, n. 9 (1984).   
138 WILLIAM N. ESKRIDGE, JR., DYNAMIC STATUTORY INTERPRETATION 2 (Harv. 
Univ. Press eds., 1994) (claiming  statutory construction is traceable back to at least 
Aristotle). However, despite its long history and wide use, the tools of statutory conception 
are not universally accepted. Many judges and scholars alike reject the purported coherence 
and  consistency  of  the  theory  of  statutory  construction.  See,  e.g.,  Nicholas  Quinn 
Rosenkranz, Federal Rules of Statutory Interpretation, 115 HARV. L. REV. 2085, 2088 
(2002). (“The interpretive status quo is cacophonous. Every judge and scholar has his own 
theory of how best to interpret statutes, and this diversity renders the interpretive project 
unpredictable."); see also Frank H. Easterbrook, The Absence of Method in Statutory 
Interpretation, 84 UNIV. OF CHI. L. REV. 81, 81 (2017) (arguing it is “doubtful” whether there 
are practices in the field of legal interpretation). But the Supreme Court itself remains 
convinced of the utility of the tools of statutory construction. See, e.g., U.S. v. Am. Trucking 
Ass’ns, Inc., 310 U.S. 534, 543–44 (1940) (“When aid to the construction of the meaning of 
words, as used in the statute, is available, there certainly can be no ‘rule of law’ which forbids 
its use, however clear the words may appear on ‘superficial examination.’”). 
139 See 2A Sutherland, Statutes and Statutory Construction, § 45.05 (Norman 
Singer, ed., 4th ed. 1984) (“For the interpretation of statutes, ‘intent of the legislature’ is the 
criterion that is most often cited.”). 
140 See Felix Frankfurter, Some Reflections on the Reading of Statutes, 47 COLUM. 
L. REV. 527, 529 (1947). When applied to an agency’s reading of a statute, a proper statutory 
construction analysis preserves the distinction between the roles of the judiciary, executive, 
and legislature: by methodically deciphering a statute’s meaning, courts conscientiously 
applying the various methods of statutory construction can determine congressional intent 
and employ appropriate executive deference without usurping the legislative function. Some 
Justices, however, disagree that Chevron serves this function and instead argue that Chevron 
deference violates the separation of powers principle and further maintain that Chevron 
usurps judicial function. See, e.g., Michigan v. EPA, 135 S. Ct. 2699, 2712–13 (2015) 
(Thomas, J., concurring) (stating that Chevron circumvents judges’ ability to exercise their 
judgment to make the best reading of an ambiguous statute while giving the executive the 
authority to say what the law is and further alleging “Chevron deference raises serious 
separation-of-powers questions.”); see also Gutierrez-Brizuela v. Lynch, 834 F.3d 1142, 
1149, 1153 (10th Cir. 2016) (Gorsuch, J., concurring) (sharing separation of powers concerns 
and adding that, by applying Chevron, “courts are not fulfilling their duty to interpret the law 
and declare invalid agency actions inconsistent with those interpretations in the cases and 
controversies that come before them.”). However, in regard to statutory construction 17-Jul-19]  A STEP TOO FAR  27 
courts’ disposal, and approaches to statutory construction are by no means 
uniform. When applying Chevron, courts at step one typically rely upon two 
main  theories  of  statutory  construction:  purposivism  and  textualism.141 
Proponents  of  these  theories  “generally  share  the  goal  of  adhering  to 
Congress’s intended meaning, but disagree about how best to achieve that 
goal.”142  Purposivist  judges  concentrate  on  understanding  the  statute’s 
purpose, often by “focus[ing] on the legislative process” and considering the 
precise issue the legislature attempted to resolve through the ambiguous 
statute.143 To purposivists, the legislative history, including the committee 
reports and floor statements, aids the judge in “try[ing] to think his way as 
best he can into the minds of the enacting legislators and imagine how they 
would have wanted the statute applied to the case at bar.”144 In contrast, 
textualist judges largely reject the quest to discover legislative purpose,145 
preferring to prioritize the statute’s text and specific words to decipher its 
meaning.146  However,  despite  the  differences  in  the  theories’  focus,  in 
                                                 
generally, courts have held if Congress uses an ambiguous phrase—such as particular social 
group—“without defining it, then courts must give the phrase content by bringing various 
tools of statutory construction to bear on the ambiguity” because “[d]efining terms that 
Congress did not is an inherent incident of the judicial power.” Nicholas Quinn Rosenkranz, 
Federal Rules of Statutory Interpretation, 115 HARV. L. REV. 2085, 2103–05 (2002); see 
also Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, 467 U.S. 837, 842-43 (1984); 
VALERIE  C.  BRANNON  AND  JARED  P.  COLE,  CONG.  RES.  SERV.,  R44954,  CHEVRON 
DEFERENCE: A PRIMER 1 (2017). Statutory construction, then, allows the judiciary to 
ascertain and evaluate the formulated policy that Congress intended (albeit ambiguously 
expressed) and the executive interpreted rather than impermissibly initiate policy itself. Felix 
Frankfurter, Some Reflections on the Reading of Statutes, 47 COLUM. L. REV. 527, 529

145 Indeed, Judge Posner has criticized the endeavor of statutory construction to 
discover the purpose of the legislature as “imput[ing] omniscience to Congress.” Richard A. 
Posner, Statutory Interpretation—in the Classroom and in the Courtroom, 50 UNIV. OF CHI. 
L. REV. 800, 811 (1983). 
146 In addition, many textualist judges reject the tools of purposivism specifically, 
even when they agree with the end result. For example, despite concurring with the judgment 
of Blanchard v. Bergeron in which the majority relied on legislative history, Justice Scalia 
“decline[d]  to  participate  in  this  process.”  According  to  Scalia,  seeking  guidance  in 
legislative  history  “is  neither  compatible  with  our  judicial  responsibility  of  assuring 
reasoned, consistent, and effective application of the statutes of the United States, nor 
conducive to a genuine effectuation of congressional intent, to give legislative force to each 
snippet of analysis, and even every case citation, in committee reports that are increasingly 
unreliable evidence of what the voting Members of Congress actually had in mind.” 489 U.S. 28  A STEP TOO FAR  [17-Jul-19 
practice,  judges  typically  combine  elements  of  both  purposivism  and 
textualism147 and use many of the same tools to reach their conclusions.148  
Relying  on  the  purposivist  and  textualist  tools  of  statutory 
construction to assess ambiguity and also considering past agency practice,149 
if the court concludes that Congress has directly spoken on the matter, the 
court must straightforwardly apply the congressional edict.150 Conversely, if 
the term remains ambiguous, the court proceeds to Chevron step two.151 
Step two. If the court reaches the second step, there is a presumption 
of gap filling applied to the ambiguous statute: the ambiguity serves as a 
“delegation of authority to the agency to elucidate a specific provision of the 
statute  .  .  .  .”152  In  this  instance,  the  court  cannot  substitute  its  own 
interpretation of that statutory term;153 it must defer to the agency if its 
interpretation  is  reasonable.154  Chevron’s  second  step  is  admittedly 
deferential, but does not grant agencies unfettered discretion: “[f]ederal 
administrative  agencies  are  required  to  engage  in  reasoned 
decisionmaking.”155 Essentially, an agency is required “to operate within the 
bounds of reasonable interpretation,”156 and “the process by which [the 
agency] reaches that result must be logical and rational.”157 Although an 
agency may change its course and alter a previous interpretation,158 the

R45153, STATUTORY INTERPRETATION: THEORIES, TOOLS, AND TRENDS 12–14 (2018). 
147 See, e.g., Church of the Holy Trinity v. United States, 143 U.S. 457, 462–64 
(1892) (engaging in both a plain meaning and legislative history analysis). 
148  For  example,  Judge  Easterbrook,  an  avowed  textualist,  concedes  that 
“[l]egislative history may be invaluable in revealing the setting of the enactment and the 
assumptions its authors entertained about how their words would be understood,” but 
maintains this is distinct from relying on “legislative intent [as] the basis of interpretation . . 
. .” In re Sinclair, 870 F.2d 1340, 1343 (7th Cir. 1989).

advance to the second step of Chevron as a result of courts’ tendency to “blur the line 
between the two steps.” VALERIE C. BRANNON AND JARED P. COLE, CONG. RES. SERV.,

agency’s new construction is still held to the reasonableness requirement.159  
Overlap  with  the  Administrative  Procedures  Act.  The  step  two 
reasonableness  analysis  is  parallel160  to  the  “arbitrary  and  capricious” 
standard set forth in the Administrative Procedures Act (APA).161 Courts 
typically review agency decisions and policy under Section 706(2)(A) of the 
APA to assess the reasonableness of such decisions.162 Although we frame 
our analysis as a Chevron analysis, we note that the step two discussion in 
Part IV would follow the same analysis and outcome if litigated under the 
APA. Evaluating reasonableness in step two or under the APA involves again 
applying the traditional tools of statutory construction, mirroring the step one 
analysis.163 
If a reviewing court declines to defer to an agency decision, either 
under the Chevron reasonableness test or under the APA’s arbitrary and 
capricious standard, it will remand the case to the court below for further 
proceedings consistent with its decision.164 In the immigration context, if a

B.  Statutory Construction of Particular Social Group 
 
Ordinary meaning. Regardless of the theory endorsed, the process of 
statutory construction should always begin with the text.166 This necessary 
first step looks to the statute’s plain meaning167 to read its words as a member 
of  Congress  or  reasonable  person  would  do.168  The  ordinary  meaning 
approach, the “most fundamental semantic rule of interpretation[],”169 rejects 
the discrepancy between ordinary language and “legalese” and “assume[s] 
that [C]ongress uses common words in their popular meaning, as used in the 
common speech of men.”170 Discerning ordinary meaning often requires the 
use  of  dictionaries.171  For  example,  in  an  early  and  straightforward 
application of the ordinary meaning analysis, the Supreme Court perused 
dictionary definitions and considered “the common language of the people” 
to resolve whether tomatoes are vegetables or fruits within the meaning of 
the  Tariff  Act  of  1883  (and  determined,  although  they  may  be  fruits 
“[b]otanically speaking,” a tomato is legally a vegetable).172 
Of course, the challenge with an ordinary meaning approach generally 
is that, as Judge Easterbrook explained, “ordinary readers are dealing with 
newspapers, not statutes.”173 Looking to a word’s ordinary meaning assumes 
the word’s definition and common usage has remained consistent since the 
statute’s  enactment174  and  that  the  author  and  reader  would  share  an 
understanding  of  the  context  and  linguistic  rules  of  legislative  drafting

necessary to reach the same interpretation.175 Ordinary meaning analysis 
loses its utility when the context has changed or the words at issue are 
combined in a manner outside the scope of common usage.176 
Applying  the  ordinary  meaning  strategy  to  tackle  the  phrase 
“particular social  group” exemplifies these problems and the pitfalls of 
relying on assumptions of plain meaning. Attempts to clarify this phrase 
through an ordinary meaning approach typically tend to obfuscate rather than 
illuminate.177 For instance, the Eleventh Circuit in Perez-Zenteno v. U.S 
Attorney General made a valiant effort to delve into the text of particular 
social group by cracking a dictionary,178 the staple of textualism.179 The court 
determined that:   
[w]hile  the  phrase  ‘particular  social  group’  is  not  altogether 
illuminating,  there  are  some  guideposts  to  be  drawn  from  this 
language. A ‘group’ is a number of individuals bound together by a 
community of interest, purpose or function as a class. A ‘class’ means 
a ‘society-wide grouping of people according to social status, political 
or economic similarities, or interests of ways of life in common.’ 
Thus, the phrase ‘social group’ implies a subset of the population 
bound together by some discrete and palpable characteristics. The 
addition of the modifier ‘particular’ suggests some narrowing from 
the breadth otherwise found in the term ‘social group.’ ‘Particular’ 
means ‘of, relating to, or being a single definite person or thing as 
distinguished from some or all others.’ Thus, a particular social group 
denotes some characteristic setting the group off in a definite way 
from  the  vast  majority  of  society;  indeed,  ‘particular’  must 
meaningfully narrow the possibilities or it would be mere surplusage 
and redundant of the word ‘group.’ These limited textual clues, then, 
tell us that a particular social group must be defined more narrowly.180

176  See  VALERIE  C.  BRANNON,  CONG.  RES.  SERV.,  R45153,  STATUTORY 
INTERPRETATION: THEORIES, TOOLS, AND TRENDS 20 (2018). Similarly, one cannot rely on 
an ordinary meaning analysis when “the context indicates they [the common words] bear a 
technical  sense.”  ANTONIN  SCALIA  &  BRYAN  A.  GARNER,  READING  LAW:  THE 
INTERPRETATION OF LEGAL TEXTS 69 (Thomson/West, ed., 2012). 
177 Indeed, even determined textualists do not insist on relying on ordinary meaning 
when the results are confusing or “absurd.” Green v. Bock Laundry Machine Co., 490 U.S.

(emphasis added). 32  A STEP TOO FAR  [17-Jul-19 
Essentially, perusing the dictionary resulted in the borderline tautological 
conclusion that a particular social group is a number of individuals with 
characteristics in common that can be distinguished from society at large.  
Yet, in cobbling together these definitions and nesting the terms 
within one another, the Eleventh Circuit’s reading of a particular social group 
is more restrictive than the dictionary’s implications. The ordinary meaning 
of particular social group based on the cited dictionary definitions indicates 
simply that the group is narrower than society as a whole; the definitions limit 
the group by its “distinguished” and “definite” characteristic, not its size. The 
group, then, cannot be defined so broadly as to subsume the entire population. 
Moreover, “particular” implies the ability to be distinguished from “some,” 
not  necessarily  most  or  “all.”  Consequently,  the  Eleventh  Circuit’s 
extrapolation that a particular social group can be set apart “in a definite way 
from  the  vast  majority  of  society”181  is  internally  contradictory  and 
unsupported  by  the  sources  the  court  references.  Even  this  seemingly 
straightforward tool of statutory construction, then, can be misapplied and 
result in misguided precedent.   
  Furthermore, the Eleventh Circuit failed to appreciate an important 
caveat in the ordinary meaning strategy: the assumption that common words 
have their popular, everyday meaning is overcome when those common 
words are combined in a manner that infuses them with a specialized legal 
meaning.182 “Particular,” “social,” and “group” are common words, yet their 
combination  elevates  the  phrase’s  meaning  from  the  everyday  to  the 
technical.183  In  such  circumstances,  an  ordinary  meaning  analysis  is 
inappropriate.  
Rather than providing a conclusive definition of a particular social 
group, the ordinary meaning analysis is a useful initial step in understanding 
the term.184 The dictionary reveals that a particular social group must be 
distinguishable from society generally through a similarity among group 
members’ “interest,” “purpose,” or “way of life.” The group cannot be

184 In fact, when “the isolated language” of the statute results in a definition 
incompatible with congressional intent, courts have advised moving on to “the legislative 
history and the statutory purpose” to gain a better understanding of the term. Moore v. Harris,

overbroad, but such a fatal flaw would be based on the lack of clarity of its 
defining characteristic, not its proportionate size in society. In light of the 
above pitfalls of a purely textualist analysis, we turn to other tools of statutory 
construction necessary to further define this phrase.185  
Canons of construction. The canons of statutory construction “are a 
familiar staple of statutory interpretation.”186 Another preferred strategy of 
textualists, the canons developed through common law,187 focusing on the 
language of the statute and operating as assumptions for how Congress 
expresses meaning rather than as strict rules.188 Textualists use numerous 
types of statutory canons, ranging from those with proverbial significance,189 
ancient origins, and Latin pedigree to newcomer canons that lack the Latin 
nomenclatures of their predecessors.190  
Ejusdem Generis and Noscitur a Sociis. Two of the most relevant 
canons  for  interpreting  the  refugee  definition  are  ejusdem  generis  (the 
“residual  clause  canon”)  and  noscitur  a  sociis  (the  “associated  words 
canon”).191 The canon ejusdem generis requires a judge to “interpret a general 
                                                 
185 The limitations of an ordinary meaning approach are also apparent in Matter of 
Acosta, where the Board of Immigration Appeals offered a straightforward reading of the 
term, but implicitly conceded the insufficiency of this endeavor by immediately after 
applying the ejusdem generis canon of construction, discussed below. 19 I&N Dec. 211, 
232–33 (BIA 1985) (“A purely linguistic analysis of this ground of persecution suggests that 
it may encompass persecution seeking to punish either people in a certain relation, or having 
a certain degree of similarity, to one another or people of like class or kindred interests, such 
as shared ethnic, cultural, or linguistic origins, education, family background, or perhaps 
economic activity. . . . We find the well-established doctrine of ejusdem generis . . . to be 
most helpful in construing the phrase ‘membership in a particular social group.’”) (citations

188 See U.S. v. Mescall, 215 U.S. 26, 31 (1909) (“[Ejusdem generis] is only a rule 
of construction to aid us in arriving at the real legislative intent. It is not a cast-iron rule, it 
does not override all other rules of construction, and it is never applied to defeat the real 
purpose of the statute, as that purpose may be gathered from the whole instrument.”); see

useful when the language is ambiguous . . . .”). 
189 Noscitur a sociis, for example, is essentially a proverb. Riley’s Dictionary of 
Latin Quotations defines noscitur a sociis by other proverbs such as “[h]e is known from his 
companions[]” and “[b]irds of a feather.” 4 HENRY THOMAS RILEY, DICTIONARY OF LATIN

term to reflect the class of objects reflected in the more specific terms 
accompanying it.”192 When a statute enumerates specific items in a list and 
includes a “general” or “catch-all” term,193 that general term should be 
interpreted similarly to the more specific items that preceded it.194 This canon 
needs at least two specific terms to precede the general term and for the 
general term to occur near the list’s end.195 Ejusdem generis compels the 
judge to resist reading a general term in a list more broadly: Congress meant 
to confine that general term “to covering subjects comparable to the specifics 
it follows.”196 For example, in a statute that applies to an “owner, importer, 
consignee, agent” and “other person,” the Supreme Court read the phrase 
“other person” as “of like class” with the previously enumerated items and 
interpreted it accordingly.197 
Similarly, the canon noscitur a sociis also attempts to extrapolate a 
term’s meaning from its fellow list items.198 This canon states that “the 
meaning of a word may be known from accompanying words,”199 and a judge 
applying  this  “commonsense  canon”  gives  a  vague  term  “more  precise 
content by the neighboring words with which it is associated.”200 For noscitur 
a sociis to apply, “terms must be conjoined in such a way as to indicate that 
they have some quality in common.”201 Essentially, if several items in a list 
share an attribute, the judge interprets other items in that list to share that

198 In fact, the canons are so similar that courts sometimes use ejusdem generis and 
noscitur a sociis interchangeably. See, e.g., Babbitt v. Sweet Home Chapter of Cmtys for a 
Great Oregon, 515 U.S. 687, 720–21 (1995) (O’Connor, J., concurring) (After quoting a case 
that purportedly uses ejusdem generis, Justice O’Connor writes “I would call it noscitur a 
sociis, but the principle is much the same: The fact that ‘several items in a list share an 
attribute counsels in favor of interpreting the other items as possessing that attribute as 
well[.]’” (citing Beecham v. United States, 511 U.S. 368, 371 (1994)) Similarly, in regard to 
particular social group specifically, the Supreme Court in Matter of Acosta stated its analysis 
used ejusdem generis, but arguably applied noscitur a sociis instead. 19 I&N Dec. 211, 233

attribute as well.202 To illustrate, in understanding the verb “take” in the 
context of a statute that prohibits the taking of endangered animals, the 
Supreme Court looked to the related statutory terms (“harass, harm, pursue, 
hunt, shoot, wound, kill, trap, capture, or collect”) to read “take” as consistent 
with those functions.203 
Despite some judicial skepticism of the canons’ utility, legislators 
themselves know of and often rely upon certain canons in their lawmaking. 
Therefore, the canons can inform our understanding of those laws. For 
instance, Judge Richard Posner has criticized statutory construction and the 
use  of  canons  specifically,  claiming  that  “judicial  opinions  continue  to 
pretend far more often than they should that the interpretation of statutes is 
the mechanical application of well understood interpretive principles—the 
canons—to  legislative  materials.”204  But  although  judges’  proper 
understanding of the canons is a subjective inquiry, empirical studies of 
agency  officials  involved  in  rulemaking205  and  congressional  counsels 
responsible for legislative drafting concluded that the majority of respondents 
“were not only aware of some of the interpretive rules that courts employ . . 
. but told [researchers] that these legal rules affect how they draft . . .”206 
Specifically, ejusdem generis and noscitur a sociis were both demonstrably 
well-known  among  lawmakers  and  the  most  commonly  used  of  the 
approximation canons.207 This agency and congressional reliance on the 
canons bolsters their use by the judiciary and further justifies their application 
here to assess ambiguity.  
                                                 
202 See Beecham v. U.S., 511 U.S. 368, 371 (1994). However, the Supreme Court 
has also repeatedly emphasized that examining the associated words provides helpful 
guidance but does not justify reading the term at issue more narrowly than Congress 
intended. See, e.g., U.S. v. Powell, 423 U.S. 87, 90 (1975); see also Gustafson v. Alloyd Co.,

Turning to particular social group, applying these linguistic inference 
canons to determine the group’s characteristics requires examining the other 
items in the refugee definition list: race, religion, nationality, and political 
opinion.208 As fellow grounds of asylum, their inclusion in the same list 
implies they have sufficient qualities in common to justify the application of 
ejusdem generis and noscitur a sociis. However, there is an immediate 
challenge to defining the general term “particular social group” by the more 
specific terms in the list: it presupposes the other items in the list are in fact 
more  specific.  Examining  the  other  grounds  of  asylum  reveals  the 
nebulousness inherent in each seemingly straightforward list item.209  
Race. The first ground of asylum, race, is a problematic term that 
“should be understood broadly to include all kinds of ethnic groups[.]”210 In 
fact, because science has debunked the belief that races are biologically 
distinct,211 courts frequently prefer the term “ethnicity” to race.212 Race, then, 
is not a “scientific concept, but rather a social phenomenon of stigmatization 
leading  to  a  subjective  position  where  collective  identities  are  social 
constructs dependent upon variable perceptions.”213 This view of race uses 
discrimination as a definitional component, effectively defining race partly 
                                                 
208 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(42)(A). 
209 This endeavor requires recourse to judicial precedent, arguably another tool of 
statutory construction. See infra Part II, which turns to judicial precedent regarding particular 
social group specifically.

by persecution.214 Recognizing the social component of race also necessitates 
deference to racial delineations in an asylum seeker’s country of origin rather 
than  in  the  United  States.215  Race  may  overlap  with  nationality216  and 
religion.217 Importantly, courts do not find a group’s relative size in society 
relevant to determining if that group constitutes a race; for example, in Singh 
v.  INS,  the  Ninth  Circuit  held  an  Indo-Fijian  experienced  race-based 
persecution in Fiji by Fijian civilians even though there were similar numbers 
of ethnic Fijians and Indo-Fijians.218 This example also evidences courts’ 
consistent holding that a private actor may be the agent of persecution for 
race-and  ethnicity-based  asylum  claims.  Often,  the  asylum  applicant  is 
targeted for his or her race by a nongovernmental actor whom the government 
is unable or unwilling to control; these claims are cognizable when the 
applicant meets the other requirements for asylum.219 
Religion. Courts also define religion broadly and are reluctant to place 
high hurdles on demonstrating membership in a religion. 220 Instead, courts 
are clearer in defining what a religion is not:221 Adherence to a religion does 
not require comprehensive knowledge of doctrine or custom,222 consistently

both beliefs and practices.”). 
221 Moreover, courts often conflate what constitutes a religion with how to define a 
religion  itself;  consequently,  these  takeaways  from  these  analyses  are  discussed 
interchangeably here. 
222 See, e.g., Rizal v. Gonzales, 442 F.3d 84, 90 (2d Cir. 2006) (“To the extent that 
the IJ's conclusion stemmed from the rationale that a certain level of doctrinal knowledge is 
necessary in order to be eligible for asylum on grounds of religious persecution, we expressly 
reject this approach.”); Yong Ting Yan v. Gonzales, 438 F.3d 1249, 1255 (10th Cir. 2006) 
(“We agree with the Eighth Circuit that a detailed knowledge of Christian doctrine may be 
irrelevant to the sincerity of an applicant's belief . . . .”); Zhen Li Iao v. Gonzales, 400 F.3d 
530,  533  (7th  Cir.  2005)  (noting  with  concern  the  “disturbing  feature[]”  of  courts’ 38  A STEP TOO FAR  [17-Jul-19 
attending  church  or  religious  meetings,223  or  participating  in  a  strict 
hierarchical structure.224 Like race, the number of adherents to religion is 
immaterial to determining religion-based persecution.225 
Partly as a result of the vague criteria extrapolated from precedent,226 
courts have struggled with how to conceptualize new spiritual movements 
that eschew easy categorization. This is exemplified in the courts’ evaluation 
of asylum claims based on the practice of Falun Gong. “Falun Gong is an 
international movement, though primarily Chinese, that is often referred to 
as a ‘religion’ . . . though it is not religion in the Western sense”227—indeed, 
“Falun Gong does not consider itself a religion.”228 In fact, there is no 
doctrine, symbol, hierarchy, deity, or requirement for membership, and the 
movement is more akin to traditional Chinese medicine.229 But courts have 
accepted that Falun Gong is a religion because the Chinese government 
recognizes it as such,230 and determine membership in that religion by an 
individual’s avowed personal belief. 231 Generally, self-identification with 
that religion and societal persecution or discrimination are two factors that 
indicate membership in a religion. 
First, the Falun Gong and religion cases reveal a rare commonality to 
identifying membership in a religion: belief is one of the few consistent 
requirements.232 And because belief and commitment to a religion may 
                                                 
“exaggerated notion of how much religious people know about their religion.”); Muhur v. 
Ashcroft, 355 F.3d 958, 961 (7th Cir. 2004) (“One can question the weight that the asylum 
officer and the immigration judge placed on ignorance of the details of religious doctrine . . 
. as evidence that an individual is not a true believer. . . . Yet how many Roman Catholics 
know who founded the Catholic Church . . . ?”). 
223 See, e.g., Yong Ting Yan v. Gonzales, 438 F.3d 1249, 1256 (10th Cir. 2006) 
(discounting the importance of frequent church attendance to defining membership in a 
religion).  
224 See Muhur v. Ashcroft, 355 F.3d 958, 961 (7th Cir. 2004) (noting that Jehovah’s 
“Witnesses don't even distinguish between laity and clergy”). 
225 Zhen Li Iao v. Gonzales, 400 F.3d 530, 533 (7th Cir. 2005) (“The number of 
followers of Falun Gong in China is estimated to be in the tens of millions, all of them subject 
to persecution.”). 
226 Some judges have challenged the idea that a uniform test of religion is even 
possible. Judge Posner, for instance, notes that “[d]ifferent religions attach different weights 
to different aspects of the faith[,]” which calls into question courts’ ability to construct a 
bright line religion rule. Zhen Li Iao v. Gonzales, 400 F.3d 530, 533 (7th Cir. 2005).

individual who engages in Falun Gong exercises in accordance with its teachings can 
“truthfully declare himself or herself a bona fide adherent to Falun Gong.”). 
232 Yong Ting Yan v. Gonzales, 438 F.3d 1249, 1255 (10th Cir. 2006) (The 
applicant is a member of a religion as “a believer and adherent of Christianity . . . .”). 17-Jul-19]  A STEP TOO FAR  39 
manifest  “in  public  or  private,  in  teaching,  practice,  worship,  and 
observance[,]”233 a crucial marker of membership in a religion appears to be 
self-identification.234  A  religion  might  not  issue  a  document  indicating 
membership;235 in fact, some religions have no formal requirements for 
membership at all.236 Membership in a religion instead may be measured by 
“the sincerity of an applicant’s belief[.]”237 Consequently, religion does not 
need to be limited to adherence to a specific theological doctrine but may be 
construed more broadly as an identity or way of life.238  
Second,  analysis  of  Falun  Gong  and  other  religions239  also 
demonstrates the important role of differential treatment by the government 
and society in defining membership in a religion. Societal Chinese authorities 
regard  Falun  Gong  as  a  disfavored  religion,  and  courts  view  this 
discriminatory treatment as evidence of a religion.240 Although Falun Gong 
cases  often  involve  governmental  persecution,  numerous  religion-based 
asylum cases show that private actors may be the source of persecution; 
indeed, “it is well established that private acts may be persecution” if the 
government cannot control those actions.241 The Sixth Circuit explicitly

Because harm due to a lack or rejection of religion paradoxically may qualify as religion-
based persecution as well, requiring documentation to demonstrate religion would be 
counterintuitive. See USCIS 24; see, e.g., Ahmadshah v. Ashcroft, 396 F.3d 917 (8th Cir.

239 Similarly, even a religious sect within a religion can experience religious 
persecution from society at large, and that group is identified partly through the persecution. 
See, e.g., Sahi v. Gonzales, 416 F.3d 587, 587 (7th Cir. 2005) (“[Applicant] is a member of

persecution,  even  if  perpetrated  by  civilians.”242  Evidence  that  society 
(measured by governmental actors and private citizens) discriminates against 
a group based on their different beliefs is evidence that that this group meets 
the religion ground for asylum. Therefore, as with race, religion is defined 
partly by persecution. Essentially, the court considers whether the asylum 
seeker identifies as an adherent or part of a religious group and whether 
society treats that group differently. 
Nationality. Nationality, a deceptively simple concept, does not need 
to be reduced to citizenship.243 Indeed, equating nationality and citizenship is 
problematic  because  statelessness,  often  resulting  from  discriminatorily 
withholding citizenship, may paradoxically constitute persecution.244 Rather, 
nationality  can extend to a describe “a group of people with the same 
language, culture, and history who form part of a political nation”245—a 
description reminiscent of the “social group” definition discussed above that 
the Eleventh Circuit decried as too broad to serve as a proper ground for 
asylum.246 The United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) 
agrees with this expansive view of nationality, recognizing this protected 
ground as “a broad concept that includes ethnic groups, linguistic groups, and 
groups defined by common cultures.”247 As with race and religion, the 
persecutor may be a private actor inflicting “anti-foreigner violence” whom 
the government is unable or unwilling to control.248

beyond the statutory list. The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant 
Responsibility Act of 1996 enumerated specific forms of harm that constitute 
persecution on the basis of political opinion:249   
For purposes of determinations under this Act, a person who has 
been  forced  to  abort  a  pregnancy  or  to  undergo  involuntary 
sterilization, or who has been persecuted for failure or refusal to 
undergo  such  a  procedure  or  for  other  resistance  to  a  coercive 
population control program, shall be deemed to have been persecuted 
on account of political opinion, and a person who has a well-founded 
fear that he or she will be forced to undergo such a procedure or 
subject to persecution for such failure, refusal, or resistance shall be 
deemed to have a well-founded fear of persecution on account of 
political opinion.250 
 
Beyond these instances, however, determining political opinion is 
murky.  U.S.  Citizenship  and  Immigration  Services  maintains  that  this 
protected ground “should be viewed in a broad sense to include any opinion 
on any matter in which the machinery of the state, government and police 
may be engaged.”251 Topics courts have seen as political, depending on the 
circumstances,  have  included  feminism,252  exposing  government  human 
rights abuses, union membership, participating in certain student groups, 
opposition  to  gangs  or  drug  cartels,  whistleblowing,253  refusing  to  join 
guerilla  forces,254  deserting  the  military255—and  not  holding  a  political 
                                                 
249 We note that Congress included this political opinion definition in 1996 in 
response  to  pressures  from  human  rights  activists,  who  argued  that  Chinese  asylum 
applicants subjected to coercive population control should not have to prove that their 
resistance to such policy constituted a political opinion. Thus, this definition was essentially 
a political decision by Congress rather than a carefully considered definition of what 
constitutes a political opinion. Orly Gez, A Compromise Solution to Prevent Fraudulent

opinion at all.256 Finally, a private actor may be the source of persecution for 
political opinion-based asylum claims; often, these private actors are guerilla 
groups  or  political  parties  who  are  not  currently  in  control  of  the 
government.257 For instance, the Colombian leftist guerilla group Fuerzas 
Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia (FARC), originally established as the 
military  wing  of  the  Colombian  Communist  party,  is  a  frequent 
nongovernmental agent of persecution in political asylum claims that the 
government is unable or unwilling to control.258  
Overall, determining whether an applicant holds a political opinion 
involves  a  “complex  and  contextual  factual  inquiry  into  the  nature  of 
the asylum applicant’s activities in relation to the political context in which 
the  dispute  took  place.”259  Political  opinion  can  take  various  forms, 
demonstrated through both speech and action,260 and spans the gamut of 
ideologies and identities, from a clear affiliation with a political party to an 
activity seen as supporting or opposing a particular governmental regime or 
institution.261 The centrality of that political opinion to an applicant’s life is 
not relevant: political opinion persecution may apply both to diplomats whose 
political  opinion  is  part  of  their  identity  and  to  “individuals  who  fled 
revolution”  who  may  not  be  politically  active  but  are  threatened  by

disruptions to their country’s political stability.262  
Instead of providing clarity, political opinion is practically a question-
begging asylum ground: what constitutes “political” is unclear.263  
As Applied to Particular Social Group. Despite these ambiguities in 
the other grounds of asylum, applying the principles of ejusdem generis and 
noscitur a sociis to particular social group does reveal some commonalties 
among list items that should be attributed to particular social group as well. 
First, the protected grounds are meant to be interpreted broadly. Courts and 
policymakers in judicial precedent and guidance reiterate the importance of 
taking an expansive view of each of the protected grounds.264 Examining the 
other protected grounds shows that the characteristic that unites the group 
does not need to be inflexibly specific. Each ground of asylum lacks rigid 
parameters.265  Therefore,  the  common  characteristic  that  is  part  of  the 
ground’s definition must be distinguishable, but the law does not require strict 
precision for the other protected grounds of asylum. 
Second, membership in or qualification for a protected ground can be 
evidenced by how society views and treats that group. More specifically, 
discriminatory  treatment  and  persecution  further  distinguish  a  group  in 
society, especially regarding race and religion. Moreover, when a group 
cannot  be  defined  by  societal  attitudes,  group  members’  own  self-
identification is relevant to determining their membership, as seen most 
clearly in the context of religion.266 
Third, the government itself need not be the agent of persecution; 
private, non-governmental actors may be the perpetrators. If a private actor 
persecutes the individual based upon a protective ground, that individual may 
qualify for asylum, even where the government itself is not conducting the 
persecution.267 A viable claim grounded on race, religion, nationality, and 
political opinion—and therefore for membership in social group— requires

Fourth,  the  canons  allow  us  to  draw  an  additional  conclusion 
concerning  a  factor  that  does  not  delineate  a  particular  social  group. 
Reinforcing the takeaway from the original meaning analysis, the other 
protected grounds are not limited by the applicable group’s potential size. 
Race as a ground for asylum is not reserved for members of a racial minority, 
and religious groups are not limited in size either: the pre-World War II 
European Jewish population (the group of asylum seekers most pertinent at 
the time of the Refugee Convention’s drafting) with presumable religion-
based asylum claims was approximately 9 million.268 Nationality does not 
depend on a country’s population, and there are no numerical quotas on 
endorsing a political opinion. Circumscribed size, then, is evidently not a 
common characteristic of the other grounds of asylum. Using the canons of 
construction to apply size limitations to the definition of “particular social 
group,” as done by the court in Perez-Zenteno, among others, is arbitrary and 
unwarranted considering the particular social group’s statutory context.  
Expressio  Unius  Est  Exclusio  Alterius.  Additionally,  another 
syntactic canon is relevant to evaluating what limitations can be properly 
placed  on  a  particular  social  group:  the  negative  expression  canon.269 
Expressio unius est exclusio alterius, or “[t]he expression of one thing implies 
the  exclusion  of  others[,]”270  assumes  that  Congress,  when  it  expressly 
includes certain items terms or exceptions from a statute, meant to exclude 
the other terms or exceptions it did not include.271 This canon also serves as 
a default rather than constitutional rule,272 although many agency drafters 
agree that this principle is often or always true.273 As a result of its general 
acceptance and intuitive nature, the negative expression canon is frequently 
applied without being named.274 When a judge reads a list of exceptions to a 
statute,  this  canon  prohibits  the  judge  from  independently  creating  and 
inserting  another,  unlisted  exception;  Congress,  the  negative  expression

canon maintains, knows how to write a complete list.275 
We do not need to speculate as to which characteristics preclude 
noncitizens from asserting membership in a particular social group for their 
asylum claims. The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), the source of the 
refugee definition, contains a clear and lengthy list of classes of noncitizens 
ineligible  for  asylum.276  For  example,  Congress  excluded  aliens  who 
participated  in  persecuting  another  based  on  a  protected  ground;277 
committed a particularly serious crime and therefore constitute a danger to 
the United States;278 committed a serious nonpolitical crime outside the 
United States;279 present a danger to United States’ security;280 or have 
engaged in a terrorist activity;281 among others. Interestingly, some asylum 
applicants with these characteristics or who participated in the prohibited 
activities could conceivably constitute a cognizable particular social group 
based on U.S. precedent,282 but for their explicit exclusion in the INA. By 
explicitly enumerating categories of ineligible aliens, Congress made clear 
that it intended to foreclose those specific asylum claims. The negative 
expression canon therefore forbids intuiting additional exceptions to further 
preclude classes of aliens from constituting a particular social group. 
Overall, using the principles of these canons to examine the list items 
reveals important commonalities. The parameters of a particular social group 
should be delineated by a common and articulable characteristic, but the 
group should not invalidated by its potential size, and there is some latitude 
in  the  pertinent  characteristic’s  specificity.  Considering  the  specific 
enumerated exceptions shows that we cannot categorically bar an unlisted 
class of noncitizens from advancing a particular social group argument; the 
canons forbid usurping the legislature’s role, and asylum requires case-by-
case determinations. The text of the statute provides a rough outline of the 
meaning of a particular social group, but after exhausting these tools of 
textualism, we must explore the statute’s underlying purpose283 to resolve the 
remaining ambiguity.284

C.  Legislative History of Particular Social Group 
 
There is a general consensus that statutory construction begins with 
the text.285 Although pure textualists insist upon ending the inquiry there and 
argue that attempting to divine legislative intent is beyond a judge’s role and 
capabilities,286 purposivists maintain that the context in which a statute was 
enacted also bears on its interpretation.287 Legislative history, “the record of 
Congress’s deliberations when enacting a law,”288 is therefore an important 
(albeit controversial)289 tool to ascertaining legislative purpose.290

REV. 527, 535 (1947). 
286  See,  e.g.,  Frank  H.  Easterbrook,  The  Absence  of  Method  in  Statutory 
Interpretation, 84 UNIV. OF CHI. L. REV. 81, 81 (2017) (“Intents are irrelevant even if 
discernable (which they aren't), because our Constitution provides for the enactment and 
approval of texts, not intents. The text is not evidence of the law; it is the law.”). However, 
“[j]udges do not always use legislative history to determine a statute’s purpose. Even 
textualist judges may use legislative history to determine whether a statutory term has a 
specialized meaning . . . .” VALERIE C. BRANNON, CONG. RES. SERV., R45153, STATUTORY 
INTERPRETATION: THEORIES, TOOLS, AND TRENDS 37 (2018). Indeed, some textualists make 
this concession explicit; Judge Easterbrook, for instance, noted he is “willing to consult 
legislative history as a cue to linguistic usage, even though not as an authoritative guide to 
meaning.” Frank H. Easterbrook, The Absence of Method in Statutory Interpretation, 84 
UNIV. OF CHI. L. REV. 81, 91 (2017). A textualist who examines the legislative history of the 
U.S. refugee definition with such a goal in mind would be disappointed. Some members of 
Congress recognized the ambiguity in a particular social group’s specialized meaning at the 
time of the Refugee Act’s drafting. During House debates, for example, Congressman Lott 
acknowledged that “[o]ne of the most obvious [issues with the refugee definition] is the lack 
of criteria which will be used in evaluating which refugees and how many will be admitted.”

statutory term).  17-Jul-19]  A STEP TOO FAR  47 
Even a relatively ambiguous statute “may have a rich legislative 
history[.]”291  By  examining  a  law’s  progression  through  the  legislative 
process, a judge considers “the problem that Congress was trying to solve by 
enacting the disputed law” to discern congressional intent.292 In regard to the 
codification of asylum law, the legislative process for both the INA and 
Refugee Act of 1980, as well as the definition’s origins in the 1951 Refugee 
Convention and its 1967 Protocol, is consequently relevant to providing 
context to understand the meaning behind a particular social group. Although 
there are no clear criteria buried in a congressional hearing or committee 
report, the legislative history does reveal helpful guidance for shaping the 
parameters of a particular social group. 
Immigration and Nationality Act. The refugee crisis in the aftermath 
of World War II forced the United States to recognize the insufficiency of its 
immigration  system.293  Previously,  Congress’s  reactionary  approach  to 
refugees  had  involved  a  “series  of  temporary  responses  to  emergency 
crises[,]” and critics of this piecemeal legislative strategy hoped that the 
unprecedented numbers of European refugees would galvanize Congress to 
establish  clear  criteria  for  asylum.294  Instead,  Congress  passed  the 
Immigration and Nationality Act in 1952. 
The INA, the basis for U.S. immigration law, is mired in a history of 
intentional congressional discrimination. Writing on statutory construction 
generally, Judge Easterbrook warns us that “[r]elying on the text does the 
least harm, for the text is visible to everyone, while legislative history can 
take people by surprise . . . .”295 The INA demonstrates this point. The Act’s 
legislative  history  is  replete  with  Congress’s  self-congratulation  for 
“remov[ing] the last vestige of racial discrimination” from the immigration 
system.296 In reality, “enacted . . . at the depth of the cold war and the 
restrictionist atmosphere of that era[,]”297 the INA codified xenophobia.298

An  assumption  that  immigrants  are  potentially  dangerous  to  the  U.S. 
underpins the INA. For instance, Representative Wood, opposing refugee 
rights, declared on the House floor that, because “Western Europeans have 
made the best citizens in America” it would be unwise to welcome into the 
U.S. people who “are not yet of the type that can easily be built into good 
American citizens. It seems to me that the question of racial origins—though 
I am not a follower of Hitler—there is something to it.”299  
Congress incorporated these racist beliefs into the Act by instituting 
quotas based on ethnicity without including a separate provision for admitting 
refugees.300 Its quota provisions were so suspect that President Truman 
established a commission to review the INA; it concluded that the Act “rests 
upon an attitude of hostility and distrust against all aliens.”301 Based upon 
these conclusions, on June 25, 1952, Truman vetoed the INA, finding the Act 
to be “at variance with American ideals” and “deliberately and intentionally” 
discriminatory.302 According to Truman, one purpose of the INA was to 
“virtually eliminate immigration to this country” from disfavored parts of the 
world.303 Despite Truman’s criticisms, Congress overrode his veto just two 
days later, and the INA became law.304 
  The 1965 amendments to the INA did little to remedy its defects. 
Although these amendments included “[t]he first permanent statutory basis 
for the admission of refugees[,]” the refugee standards put in place were 
extremely restrictive by country of origin and grounds for protection.305 The 
Act limited refugees to individuals fleeing communist-dominated or Middle 
Eastern  countries  and  situations  in  which  “such  flight  was  caused  by 
persecution or fear of persecution on account of race, religion, or political 
opinion.”306

Refugee Act of 1980. Broadly, the Refugee Act codified the refugee 
admissions  quota  while  repealing  the  discriminatory  national  origins 
system.307 Additionally, as stated by Congressman Weiss in support of the 
Refugee Act during House debates, the INA created “a hodgepodge of 
legislative and administrative authorizations. Indeed, it is not a program at all 
but  many  disparate  provisions  which  were  established  to  accommodate 
different  refugee  groups  as  crises  occurred.”308  Congress  intended  the 
Refugee Act to therefore establish uniformity and provide much-needed 
administrable guidance for the asylum system. 
Importantly, the Refugee Act also incorporated into U.S. law for the 
first time “membership in a particular social group” as well as nationality as 
explicit grounds for asylum. Examining the legislative history of the Refugee 
Act, including the statements made during debates in the congressional 
record, committee reports, and testimony of experts during congressional 
hearings,  informs  our  understanding  of  the  intended  interpretation  of 
membership in a particular social group. Specifically, Congress planned the 
Act to provide a flexible definition for the grounds of asylum that would 
remain workable in changing circumstances; reemphasize Congress’s role in 
immigration policy and limit the discretion of the executive; and recognize 
the value of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.  
Providing Flexibility. The legislative history of the Refugee Act 
reveals that Congress intended to create a refugee definition in which the 
grounds of asylum would be flexible and applicable to future developments 
in refugees’ circumstances. The necessity for procedural and substantive 
flexibility is apparent from the Act’s very conception. In calling up the bill 
on the House floor, Representative Claude Pepper declared that “the purpose 
of this bill, a very salutary and desirable bill, is to establish a coherent and 
comprehensive U.S. refugee policy, this being accomplished by creating a 
systematic and flexible procedure for the admission and resettlement of 
refugees.”309  
To Congress, flexibility was necessary to ensure the Act’s longevity. 
Indeed, some members of Congress viewed the criteria’s adaptability as a 
strength of the legislation. Rather than itemize a complete list of groups 
potentially eligible for asylum,310 Representative Elizabeth Holtzman argued 
                                                 
79 Stat. 911 (1965).

309 125 CONG. REC. 35,812 (1979) (emphasis added). 
310 The legislative history of the Refugee Act does, however, give us some 
indication of certain groups would have qualified in 1980. References to eligible refugees 
often  concerned  nationality  as  a  ground  for  asylum,  focusing  on  refugee  crises  for 
Indochinese and Vietnamese asylum seekers. See, e.g., Briefing on the Growing Refugee 50  A STEP TOO FAR  [17-Jul-19 
in House debates that the Refugee Act “does not specifically refer to any 
particular group, because this is legislation not for today or next year, but for 
many years to come.”311 When drafting the Refugee Act, Congress rejected 
the restrictions of the 1965 INA amendments’ refugee definition; the House 
Committee on the Judiciary  Report found that  the 1965 definition  was 
“clearly unresponsive to the current diversity of refugee populations and [did] 
not adequately reflect the United States’ traditional humanitarian concern for 
refugees throughout the world.”312 Instead, drafters wanted to replace the 
“haphazard  system  with  a  permanent  program  for  the  admission  of 
refugees,”313 but simultaneously meant to maintain flexibility “to respond to 
emergent refugee situations which may rise at any time around the world.”314  
Speaking to the grounds of asylum specifically, the legislative history 
of the Refugee Act offers some indication of certain groups that Congress 
contemplated as qualifying for refugee status.315 An example of a particular 
social  group  was  proposed  in  a  House  Subcommittee  Hearing  on 
Immigration,  Refugees,  and  International  Law.  In  a  prepared  statement 
before  the  Subcommittee,  Harvard  Society  of  Fellows  witness  Virginia 
Dominguez  discussed  the  plight  of  Cuban  refugees.316  According  to 
Dominguez, the half a million Cubans who had entered the United States in 
the two decades following the Cuban Revolution “fit fairly closely the

was immediately put to the test just weeks after its passage with an influx of approximately 
120,000 Cuban refugees. Unfortunately, the Act proved ill-equipped to appropriately handle 
these claims. Although “[t]he Refugee Act was designed primarily to control the admission 
of refugees through an orderly admissions process, . . . these mass claims for asylum [ ] 
severely strained the existing legal framework.” Deborah E. Anker and Michael H. Posner,

stereotype of the refugee” in the Refugee Act. Dominguez continued that 
many of the first wave of Cuban refugees involved in the Batista government  
were capitalists, high-level managers of foreign companies, and 
simply upper-class Cubans. Their professions, their landholdings, 
their family backgrounds, and their capital made them likely enemies 
of the socialist revolution. . . . Their ‘particular social group’ and their 
‘political  opinion’  caused  them  to  have  ‘a  well-founded  fear  of 
persecution.’ They were on, the whole, classic refugees.317  
 
This accepted framing of a particular social group demonstrates that the 
group, contrary to subsequent interpretations, has no size restrictions, can 
overlap with other parameters, and does not need to be particularly discrete 
in society. 
Such examples, however, were not meant to be exhaustive. Overall, 
the  legislative  record  consistently  shows  that  Congress318  purposefully 
refused to constrain the government’s ability to extend asylum to those in 
need  of  protection  with  a  rigid  or  fixed  refugee  definition.319  Rather, 
flexibility in the grounds of asylum was “particularly essential” to allow the 
U.S.  to  address  the  evolving  nature  of  refugee  crises.320  Consequently, 
although Congress intended the Refugee Act of 1980 to conform the U.S. 
refugee definition to the language of the 1951 Convention and 1967 Protocol, 
Congress did not limit the definition’s use to the types of refugees that existed 
in  1951,  1967,  or  1980321—Congress  expected  and  intended  our

318 This understanding of adaptability and future applicability was shared by 
President Carter. In his signing statement for the Refugee Act, Carter anticipated the refugee 
definition would be adapted to accommodate new refugees, writing that “[t]he Refugee Act 
improves procedures and coordination to respond to the often massive and rapidly changing 
refugee problems that have developed recently." Refugee Act of 1980: Statement on Signing

319 See, e.g., Refugee Act of 1979: Hearing on H.R. 2816 Before the Subcomm. on 
Immigration, Refugees, and International Law, 96th Cong. 185 (1979) (in refusing to limit 
the refugee definition, Congressman Ellsworth commented “I think what we are after here 
is that there will be a refugee policy and this new legislation long after the current problem 
of the Vietnamese refugees. . . . Under the limitations that will have to be set, the criteria 
that will have to be used to select, we argue that you should not forget the question of the 
definition of refugee being wide enough, or the question of clearly defining humanitarian 
reasons as being a proper principle of special concern, so that certain situations can be 
handled in a way in which we can bring in the prisoners of conscience which are of 
concern to us and of concern to the country.”).

321 For instance, the House Committee on Judiciary recognized in a report that the 52  A STEP TOO FAR  [17-Jul-19 
understanding and application of the grounds of asylum were expected and 
intended to change with changing circumstances. 
Constraining  Executive  Discretion.  Additionally,  another 
significant purpose of the Refugee Act was to reassert Congress’s role in 
delineating immigration policy; this intent of Congress, as evidenced by the 
Act’s  legislative  history,  informs  the  extent  to  which  we  defer  to  the 
executive’s interpretation of a particular social group. In contrast to the 
modern assumption that the executive takes the lead on immigration policy 
as a matter of national security, Congress intended the new refugee definition 
to place some constraints on the discretion of the executive in conferring 
asylum.  
For  example,  in  a  hearing  before  the  House  Subcommittee  on 
Immigration,  Citizenship,  and  International  Law,  Representative  Joshua 
Eilberg articulated the need to maintain the separation of powers in the 
context of asylum law: 
[w]hile I agree that some administrative flexibility is certainly 
required, I do not feel that it is reasonable or proper for the Congress 
to delegate to the executive branch its constitutional obligation to 
enact laws establishing this Nation’s refugee policy. I do not believe 
the Attorney General should be the sole decisionmaker on this subject 
. . .322 
Instead, to determine exactly how the executive branch would construe 
the refugee definition, Representative Eilberg requested the former Attorney 
General and the Commissioner of Immigration Service to promulgate criteria 
or general guidelines for deciding asylum cases.323 
Representative  Eilberg  saw  the  Refugee  Act  as  remedying  an

Convention. H.R. REP. NO. 608, 96th Cong. (1979) (explaining that, although detainees and

overreliance on executive discretion:  
I am deeply concerned that, under current law and procedures, 
Congress has surrendered—to a great extent—its authority to regulate 
the flow of refugees to this country. Our bill represents an attempt to 
restore this authority and, at the same time, to establish a proper 
balance  between  the  executive  and  the  legislative  branches  of 
Government in establishing the appropriate procedures governing 
their admission.324 
 
One such congressional authority that Representative Eilberg explicitly 
declined to abdicate: “Who should be considered as ‘refugees’ under our 
law?”325 Likewise, Senator Strom Thurmond feared giving too much power 
to the executive and differentiated the role of Congress in crafting the policy 
versus  the  executive’s  responsibility  to  implement  it.326  In  his  opening 
statement  concerning  additional  presidential  parole  authority,  Senator 
Thurmond maintained “[a]s a Member of the Senate, I am committed to 
support the President in his proper execution of our foreign policy and 
refugee policy, but I will not waive the right of the Congress to consent and 
be  consulted.”327  These  statements  both  emphasize  the  importance  of 
ascertaining  congressional  intent  to  discern  the  meaning  of  policy—the 
province  of  Congress—and  make  clear  that  this  intent  constrains  the 
discretion of the Attorney General. 
  Recognizing  the  Value  of  the  UNHCR.  Finally,  the  legislative 
history makes apparent Congress’s intent to refer to the United Nations High 
Commissioner  for  Refugees  (UNHCR)  to  interpret  the  Refugee  Act’s 
language. Both the legislative and executive branch recognized the value of 
the UNHCR to provide guidance on the international understanding of the 
refugee  definition.  In  a  hearing  before  the  House  Subcommittee  on 
Immigration, Citizenship, and International Law, the Department of State 
Deputy Coordinator for Human Rights  and Humanitarian Affairs explicitly 
extolled  the  importance  of  the  UNHCR,  based  on  “its  ability  to 
internationalize  refugee  problems.”328  The  Deputy  Coordinator  also

described favorably the collaboration between the Department of State and 
the UNHCR.329 Congress agreed with the Department of State on connecting 
the UNHCR to domestic law; in that same committee hearing, Representative 
Eilberg noted that “[o]ne of the basic theories underlying our refugee bill 
which is before us is that refugee situations should be internationalized; and 
I am aware that the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, is the 
primary mechanism for achieving this objective.”330 
  Taken together, the legislative history tool of statutory construction 
further elucidates the meaning of the particular social group ground for 
asylum. First, based on the evidence produced during the drafting of the 
Refugee Act of 1980, a particular social group is not to be limited by a rigid 
definition  or  confined  to  specific,  unchanging  groups;  rather,  Congress 
intended the ground to apply to groups it did not currently recognize. Second, 
to properly preserve the policymaking role of Congress, the Attorney General 
lacks the authority to enact refugee policies that unilaterally contravene the 
Refugee Act’s purpose but instead must consider a particular social group’s 
intended  flexibility  to  address  emerging  world  crises  in  exercising  his 
discretion. Third, to further define the particular social group, the Refugee 
Act’s legislative history supports recourse to the 1951 Refugee Act, its 1967 
Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees, and guidance by the UNHCR. 
We turn to these sources next. 
 
D.  Statutory Context of the Refugee Definition 
 
When defining an ambiguous statutory term, after considering the 
statutory language and legislative history, the court looks to the statutory 
context to dispel its remaining confusion.331 Although the origins of the 
refugee definition provide limited guidance on the intended interpretation of 
a particular social group, the UNHCR has subsequently disseminated helpful 
guidance for understanding the asylum ground’s parameters.

The Refugee Convention & 1967 Protocol Relating to the Status of 
Refugees. As discussed above,332 the 1951 Refugee Convention’s refugee 
definition included the grounds for asylum later adopted into U.S. law.333 But 
despite the importance of the particular social  group  ground today, the 
Refugee Convention’s drafting history offers little insight into its meaning. 
Rather, particular social group “was a last minute amendment to the draft 
proposed by a Swedish delegate.”334 According to this delegate,  
experience had shown that certain refugees had been persecuted 
because  they  belonged  to  particular  social  groups.  The  draft 
Convention made no provision for such cases, and one designed to 
cover them should accordingly be included. . . . [P]ersons . . . might 
be persecuted owing to their membership of a particular social group. 
Such  cases  existed,  and  it  would  be  as  well  to  mention  them 
explicitly.335 
Although there is no further discussion of the meaning of particular social 
group  in  the  Refugee  Convention’s  drafting  history  (or  in  early  court 
decisions or academic writings), the Swedish amendment passed with a vote 
of 14–0–8,336 and a Conference of the Plenipotentiaries of the United Nations 
adopted the entire Refugee Convention on July 28, 1951.337 
The United States is not a party to the Refugee Convention but did 
sign the 1967 Protocol, which adopted the Convention’s refugee definition 
while  removing  some  of  its  limitations338  to  make  the  Convention’s

immutable characteristic or a characteristic fundamental to human dignity.344 
Also referred to as the “ejusdem generis approach,” the Board first used this 
framework  Matter  of  Acosta,345  discussed  above.  There  are  several 
advantages to this approach: it establishes a particular social group analysis 
consistent with the other grounds of asylum; it promotes consistency and 
clear decision-making; and it allows for the evolution and extension of the 
particular social group category. However, critics argue this approach goes 
beyond ordinary meaning of the terms; it can be difficult to apply; and there 
may be uncertainty regarding which groups deserve protection.346 In contrast, 
the Australian and French courts’347 social perception approach looks to 
whether a particular social group has a common characteristic that sets them 
apart from society or makes them a cognizable group.348 This “sociological 
approach”  attempts  to  apply  an  ordinary  meaning  analysis;  advantages 
include its use without recourse to external legal standards, broader judicial 
discretion, and more inclusive understanding of what constitutes a particular 
social group. 349 This approach has received criticism for being overly broad 
and  challenging  decision-makers  to  assess  social  perceptions  of  other 
countries.350 
The UNHCR seeks to reconcile these approaches: 
a particular social  group is a  group of persons who share a 
common characteristic other than their risk of being persecuted, or 
who are perceived as a group by society. The characteristic will often 
be  one  which  is  innate,  unchangeable,  or  which  is  otherwise 
fundamental to identity, conscience or the exercise of one's human 
rights.351

This definition differs from the U.S.’s protected characteristics approach: 
a particular social group is delineated by a common characteristic or its 
perception as a group in society, and the immutability of that common 
characteristic is a factor in the analysis, but not dispositive.352 The UNHCR 
explicitly does not endorse a particular social group test that combines these 
approaches into a concomitant standard.353 
  Although the Guidelines do not have a complete list of qualifying 
particular social groups—indeed, the UNHCR instead emphasizes that the 
Refugee Convention contained no “closed-list” of groups—the Guidelines do 
provide further guidance for identifying a particular social group.354 This 
guidance further conforms the analysis of a particular social group with the 
other grounds of asylum. For instance, the UNHCR notes that the persecutor 
of an individual on the basis of membership in a particular social group does 
not need to be a government actor.355 Rather, persecution may be established 
when government authorities “knowingly tolerate[]” the violence, of “refuse, 
or prove unable, to offer effective protection.”356 Additionally, the group’s 
size  is  irrelevant  to  determining  if  the  group  is  cognizable  under  the 
Convention.357 Moreover, although a particular social group “cannot be 
defined exclusively” by its experience of persecution, persecution “may be a 
                                                 
available at http://www.unhcr.org/3d58de2da.html. 
352 The UNHCR approach is not without its critics. For instance, some scholars have 
challenged the basis for and effectiveness of merging these tests, claiming “that despite its 
advocacy of conceptual merger, UNHCR is effectively endorsing the social perception test 
as the determinative paradigm without recommending any modifications to take account of 
the conceptual and practical concerns identified by some courts and commentators.” James

relevant element for determining the visibility of a particular group.”358 The 
UNHCR  recognizes  that  a  group’s  experience  of  persecution  based  on 
another common characteristic may distinguish the group in society by 
making it more visible.359 
Similarly, the UNHCR has also produced a Handbook to serve as a 
practical guide to refugee law.360 Its comprehensiveness and wide use has 
resulted in its international recognition “as the key source of interpretation of 
international refugee law.”361 The Handbook contains a brief description of a 
particular social group: according the UNHCR, “a ‘particular social group’ 
normally  comprises  persons  of  similar  background,  habits,  or  social 
status.”362  
Although the UNHCR rules are not binding upon the U.S., drafters of 
domestic  law  intended  to  employ  its  guidance  as  a  tool  to  inform  our 
application of the asylum law.363 Yet, as discussed below, the UNHCR has a 
broader and more flexible interpretation of the particular social group than 
what has evolved in U.S. law—and is a stark contrast to the restrictive 
perspective endorsed by Attorney General Sessions in A-B-.364

359 Citing McHugh, J., in Applicant A v. Minister for Immigration and Ethnic

“Left-handed men are not a particular social group. But, if they were persecuted because they 
were left-handed, they would no doubt quickly become recognizable in their society as a 
particular social group. Their persecution for being left-handed would create a public 
perception that they were a particular social group. But it would be the attribute of being left-
handed and not the persecutory acts that would identify them as a particular social group.”

E.  Statutory Construction Takeaways 
 
Part II has explained how, in determining how the term “particular 
social group” should function within the U.S. refugee regime, the canons of 
statutory construction, legislative history, and statutory context can provide 
much-needed guidance. The term is by no means structureless, and certain 
components of the term are not ambiguous: a particular social group (1) does 
not require a size limitation and (2) can include groups victimized by private 
actors. Further, in considering remaining ambiguities in the term, the above 
analysis  demonstrates  that  particular  social  group  (3) is  meant  to  be  a 
dynamic category that adapts to modern refugee crises; (4) is meant to capture 
society’s perspective and consider the harm suffered; and (5) was an effort to 
give more control to Congress, not to the executive branch. 
 
  III.  CHEVRON STEP ONE: A-B- CONTRAVENES THE UNAMBIGUOUS INTENT 
OF CONGRESS 
 
As discussed above, the first step of Chevron requires a reviewing 
court to consider whether Congress has spoken unambiguously regarding the 
term at issue.365 Although Congress has not spoken directly as to whether 
domestic-violence-related groups can fit the definition of particular social 
group, it has given guidance as to the broader term. The statutory construction 
analysis indicates that the particularity requirement does not require limited 
group size and that the source of persecution can be private actors: two 
parameters breached by A-B-.  
 
A.  A-B- Incorrectly Implies that the Particularity Requirement Requires 
Limited Group Size 
 
The most obvious departure from the unambiguous parameters of 
particular social group is A-B-’s strong suggestion that a group’s potential 
size works against its particularity.366 Sessions contended that victims of 
                                                 
Group" Within the Context of Article 1A(2) of the 1951 Convention and/or its 1967 Protocol 
Relating to the Status of Refugees, at 4, U.N. Doc. HCR/GIP/02/02 (May 7, 2002), available 
at http://www.unhcr.org/3d58de2da.html. The Seventh Circuit has agreed; to justify its 
broader view of a particular social group, the Seventh Circuit has noted that even if many 
individuals would fit into the proposed group, the number who meet the refugee definition 
would still be limited to those who show persecuted based upon that nexus. See Cece v. 
Holder, 733 F.3d 662, 673 (7th Cir. 2013).

“private violence”—that is, individuals targeted by gangs, domestic partners, 
or  other  non-governmental  actors—are  generally  unable  to  demonstrate 
sufficient particularity due to the groups’ potential size.367 Sessions reasoned 
that police in certain countries struggle to respond to certain crimes, and thus 
many individuals will fit these categories of victims of private violence.368 
To Sessions, the widespread risk of violence and potential group size obviates 
the viability of the particular social group; because these victims “often come 
from all segments of society,” they “likely lack the particularity” required by 
precedent.369  
However, while some boundaries around the group are necessary for 
its definition, applying the tools of ejusdem generis and noscitur a sociis to 
the question of what particular social group’s boundaries should be, it is clear 
that the size of the group subjected to persecution need not be limited.370 
Looking at the other bases for asylum as examples, a racial group need not 
be a minority to experience race-based persecution,371 nor need it be limited 
to a racial group of a small size. Similarly, claims based on religion do not 
require a small or even countable number of members to delineate the 
religious group.372 Further, UNHCR guidance makes clear that the group’s 
size is irrelevant to determining  whether the  group is cognizable.373  In 
suggesting that particular social groups united by a shared harm are likely too 
large to be particular, Sessions departs from the statutory principles that 
demonstrate that the size of the group is not a disqualifying attribute to find 
that a person suffered persecution on that basis.

may be private actors, just as is possible for the other grounds for asylum—
and the standard to show persecution by such private actors is clearly stated 
in the statute, applying to all grounds. Yet in A-B-, Sessions claimed that A-
R-C-G- created a new category of particular social groups based on private 
violence.374 He then attempted to impose a higher standard for these private-
violence claims. In fact, A-R-C-G- was a continuation of both the circuit 
courts’  and  the  Board’s  practice  of  granting  asylum  on  the  basis  of 
membership in a social group where the applicant was persecuted by a private 
actor. Violence perpetrated by spouses,375 criminals,376 family members,377 
and  community  members378  has  qualified  as  persecution  on  account  of 
membership in a particular social group before and after A-R-C-G- was 
decided in 2014. These cases undercut Sessions’ efforts to cast A-R-C-G- as 
an  outlier,  demonstrating  that  A-B-  itself  actually  constituted  a  radical 
departure from precedent. 
Instead, acknowledging that private actors may be the agents of 
persecution of members of a particular social group is consistent with the 
principles of ejusdem generis and noscitur a sociis. For all other grounds of 
asylum, courts have recognized that private actors may be persecutors when 
the government is unwilling or unable to control them.379 But in addition to 
denying the viability of particular social group claims based on private 
violence, Sessions tried to raise the standard for the government’s response 
as well. Going beyond the ubiquitous “unwilling or unable” requirement of 
past cases, Sessions insisted that an asylum applicant demonstrate “that the 
government  condoned  the  private  actions”  or  showed  “a  complete 
helplessness to protect” the applicant.380 For applicants seeking asylum based 
on their membership in a social group, Sessions therefore created a disparate 
standard for private versus governmental actors—a distinction that does not 
exist for any other ground of asylum. By adding hurdles for certain asylum 
seekers persecuted by private actors, A-B- violated the guidelines of ejusdem 
generis and noscitur a sociis.

  In light of these errors and inconsistencies, reviewing courts should 
find that A-B-diverged from the discernable parameters of the term particular 
social group and decline to apply Chevron deference at step one. Even if a 
court  moves  to  Chevron  step  two,  Part  IV  demonstrates  that  A-B-’s 
conclusions misinterpret the meaning of the particular social group and 
distort precedent by going beyond the term’s inherit ambiguities to create 
new limitations that unreasonably disregard preexisting law. Therefore, A-B- 
is not entitled to deference.   
 
  IV.  CHEVRON STEP TWO: A-B- GOES BEYOND THE DEGREE OF DISCRETION 
THE AMBIGUITY ALLOWS 
Ambiguity in Chevron step one does not entitle the agency to a 
boundless interpretation of the term at issue. As the Supreme Court has 
recently reiterated, despite Chevron’s deferential standard, “the process by 
which [the agency] reaches that result must be logical and rational. It follows 
that agency action is lawful only if it rests on a consideration of the relevant 
factors.”381 In accordance with the second step in Chevron, courts next 
conduct a deeper analysis of the reasonableness of the agency’s interpretation 
applying the tools of statutory construction and policy considerations of 
“whether the agency’s position comports with the overall purpose of the 
statute in question.”382 A court conducting a Chevron step two analysis to A-
B- applying the above-described tools of statutory construction and policy 
considerations should find Sessions’ decision unreasonable. Matter of A-B- 
is not entitled to Chevron deference because it goes beyond the degree of 
discretion the ambiguity allows. 
 
A.  A-B-’s Interpretation of Particular Social Group Does Not Permit 
Flexibility to Adapt to Modern Crises as Envisioned by Congress 
 
In  defiance  of  the  tools  of  textualism  and  purposivism,  A-B- 
mistakenly refused to analyze a particular social group with its intended 
flexibility. Congress incorporated the international refugee definition into

most ambiguous, the most that can be required of the administering agency is that its 
interpretation be reasonable and consistent with the statutory purpose.”)). Alternatively, in 
conducting  analysis  under  Chevron’s  second  step,  courts  defer  to  the  agency  if  its 
interpretation was within the realm of reasonable possibilities discussed in a step one 
analysis. Id. 64  A STEP TOO FAR  [17-Jul-19 
U.S. law to create a policy that could apply to evolving crises.383 The refugee 
definition—including the particular social group ground of asylum—was 
codified  to  remedy  the  INA’s  jumble  of  provisions  adopted  as  crises 
occurred,384 and Congress declined to refer to specific groups to ensure the 
definition could be applied to groups “for many years to come.”385 Indeed, a 
court reviewing A-B- recently noted that the entire purpose of the Refugee 
Act, as stated by Congress, was to “enforce the historic policy of the United 
States to respond to the urgent needs of persons subject to persecution in their 
homelands.”386 Yet A-B- undermined the flexible utility of particular social 
group by attempting to foreclose a ground of asylum to applicants fleeing a 
major and unanticipated crisis: domestic violence and gang violence ravaging 
the Northern Triangle.387  
Despite hedging that “there may be exceptional circumstances when 
victims  of  private  criminal  activity  could  meet  [the]  requirements”  he 
enumerated,  Sessions  predicted  most  such  claims  cannot  prevail.388 
According to Sessions, 
[g]enerally, claims by aliens pertaining to domestic violence or 
gang  violence  perpetrated  by  non-governmental  actors  will  not 
qualify for asylum. While I do not decide that violence inflicted by 
non-governmental actors may never serve as the basis for an asylum 
or withholding application based on membership in a particular social 
group, in practice such claims are unlikely to satisfy the statutory

that these victims must “establish that the government protection from such harm in their

grounds for proving group persecution that the government is unable 
or unwilling to address.389  
 
Instead of appropriately applying the refugee definition with its intended 
flexibility to the burgeoning crisis in Central America,390 this pronouncement 
contradicted the explicit legislative intent revealed through the Refugee Act’s 
legislative history391 and the statutory context of the 1951 Convention and 
1967 Protocol giving rise to the international refugee definition originally.392 
Chevron deference does not apply to such an agency interpretation that is not 
“rationally related to the goals of the statute.”393 
Furthermore,  Session’s  suggestion  that  an  entire  group’s  asylum 
claims are “unlikely” to succeed394 contravenes the conclusions from the 
canons  of  statutory  construction.395  Although  the  ejusdem  generis  and 
noscitur a sociis analysis illustrates the challenges to finding commonalities, 
courts consistently emphasize in their decisions that the protected grounds 
must be interpreted broadly: each ground is applied adaptively to the facts in 
case-by-case determinations.396 Attempting to foreclose an entire type of 
harm from receiving asylum based on membership in a particular social 
group  would  restrain  courts  from  undertaking  that  adaptive  and

individualized analysis of asylum cases397—and is therefore inconsistent with 
the other grounds of asylum. Similarly, eliminating private actor persecutors 
from  the  statutory  scheme  violates  the  negative  expression  canon.398 
Congress did not choose to disallow claims based on persecution by a private 
actor (and, as the UNHCR noted, the Refugee Convention likewise refrained 
from excluding these claims).399 Sessions lacked the power to go beyond 
congressional limitations and singlehandedly legislate through an abuse of 
his certification power. 
 
B.  A-B- Denies the Relevance of the Persecutor’s Perspective and Relevant 
Harm Experienced for the Social Distinction Analysis 
 
In  evaluating  whether  the  “social  distinction”  parameter400  of 
particular social group is met, A-B- erroneously contended that the analysis 
should not take into account the perspective of the persecutor or the harm 
experienced by the group as a method of determining that the group exists.401 
Although Sessions is correct that a group cannot be defined exclusively by 
its experience of persecution,402 he incorrectly implied that considering the 
harm faced by group members is irrelevant to establishing that the group 
exists. Rather, where another common immutable characteristic unites the 
group, the experience or risk of persecution can further evidence a group’s 
social distinction. Statutory construction tools, international sources, and 
decades of precedent tell us that persecution and the persecutor’s perspective 
are often essential in determining a group’s social distinction within society.  
Embedded in Matter of A-B- dicta is an attempt to separate the 
experience  of  persecution  from  the  social  distinction  analysis  entirely. 
Sessions declared that a cognizable group must exist independently of the

women in Guatemala who are unable to leave their relationship,” was invalid because it “was 
effectively defined to consist of women in Guatemala who are victims of domestic abuse 
because the inability ‘to leave’ was created by harm or threatened harm.” With this analysis, 
he implies that harm cannot be considered when defining a group. Matter of A-B-, 27 I&N 
Dec. 316, 334-35 (Attn’y Gen. 2018).

harm suffered, failing to recognize the relevance of persecution to a group’s 
social distinction.403 Instead, Sessions dismissed the potential importance of 
persecution  to  the  establishment  of  the  group,  arguing  that  including 
persecution  in  the  group  definition  “moots  the  need  to  establish  actual 
persecution”404 and refusing to consider that harm can be an overlaying 
element of a group that actually helps set parameters of who is or is not in the 
group.  
The statutory canons ejusdem generis and noscitur a sociis reveal that 
persecution and the perspective of the persecutor is relevant to the social 
distinction analysis. To align particular social group with the other asylum 
grounds, the court must permit consideration of the persecutor’s perspective. 
For  example,  race-based  claims  originate  in  the  societal  perception  of 
racialized groups, and race-based discrimination is evidence that the group 
exists.405 Because race is a social construct, not a biological distinction, 
society’s perspective and especially the view of the persecutor is relevant; a 
person’s race may not be a point of difficulty unless and until they reside in 
a society where that race is seen as pejorative in some way. For example, a 
Ninth Circuit case found persecution of an Afghani who moved to Germany 
to be persecution based on race406—a situation which likely would not have 
arisen had the applicant remained living in Afghanistan, where her race was 
not stigmatized.  
Similarly, claims based on religion can be delineated by government 
condemnation,  requiring  the  court  to  examine  the  perspective  of  the 
persecutor  and  the  harm  experienced  by  members  of  that  religion.  As 
demonstrated in the study of Falun Gong cases, even movements without a 
deity and more closely aligned with traditional Chinese medicine can be 
classified as a religion where the government recognizes it as such.407  
Further, guidance from UNHCR, the international body relied on 
during  creation  of  the  Refugee  Act,  demonstrates  that  persecution  is  a

404 Matter of A-B-, 27 I&N Dec. 316, 335 (AG 2018); but see his subsequent 
suggestion that perhaps the perspective of the persecutor does matter: “there is significant 
room for doubt that Guatemalan society views these women, as horrible as their personal 
circumstances may be, as members of a distinct group in society, rather than each as a victim 
of a particular abuser in highly individualized circumstances.” 
405 See supra Part IIB: “Race, then, is not a ‘scientific concept, but rather a social 
phenomenon of stigmatization leading to a subjective position where collective identities are 
social constructs dependent upon variable perceptions,’” quoting ANDREAS ZIMMERMANN,

relevant inquiry.408 UNHCR guidance agrees with A-B- that the group must 
share a common characteristic other than being persecuted, but also provides 
an alternative path: that the group is perceived as a group by society.409 In 
this regard, U.S. precedent significantly deviates from UNHCR guidelines by 
requiring both of these tests to be met—common immutable characteristic 
and social distinction—and adding the third requirement of particularity. 
Although U.S. law already does not precisely follow the UNHCR model, the 
guidelines regarding delineating a particular social group remain informative. 
These  guidelines  note  that  persecution  “may  be  a  relevant  element  for 
determining the visibility of a particular group.”410 Indeed, the group’s shared 
experience of persecution may distinguish the group in society by making it 
more visible411—an idea which has been incorporated into U.S. precedent. 
Turning to precedent interpreting particular social group, courts have 
routinely considered the persecution, or the perspective of the persecutor, in 
determining  whether  a  group  is  socially  distinct.412  Numerous  prior 
decisions,  most  of  them  before  the  now-overruled  A-R-C-G-  and  not 
overruled themselves, have stated that harm cannot be the sole defining 
principle of a group, but can be a relevant consideration in the analysis.413 
Indeed, M-E-V-G-, cited with approval in A-B-,414 stated that shared past 
experiences—including harm—can delineate a group.415 M-E-V-G- offered

persecution itself, could be relevant for determining social distinction.416 For 
example,  “[t]he  former  employees  of  the  attorney  general  may  not  be 
considered  a  group  by  themselves  or  by  society  unless  and  until  the 
government begins persecuting them.”417 In experiencing maltreatment, this 
group may begin to self-identify, and society may “discern that this group of 
individuals, who share a common immutable characteristic, is distinct in 
some significant way.”418 However, in A-B-, Sessions ignored this line of 
reasoning and departed from this established principle, going so far as to 
overrule A-R-C-G- ostensibly for this reason.419  
In the now-overruled A-R-C-G-, the Board considered the applicant’s 
persecution suffered as evidence that Guatemalan women unable to leave the 
relationship are viewed as socially distinct because Guatemalan society views 
women victims of domestic violence as a group set apart from women as a 
whole.420 The Board pointed to evidence that would help an adjudicator 
determine whether society views victims of certain harms to constitute a 
particular social group: “whether the society in question recognizes the need 
to offer protection to victims of domestic violence, including whether the 
country  has  criminal  laws  designed  to  protect  domestic  abuse  victims, 
whether  those  laws  are  effectively  enforced,  and  other  sociopolitical 
factors.”421  
The Board in A-R-C-G- also acknowledged that a finding of social 
distinction would depend on the individual facts and evidence in each case.422 
This individualized approach is wholly in keeping with Sessions’ contention 
that “[t]he mere fact that . . . certain populations are more likely to be victims 
of crime[] cannot itself establish an asylum claim”423—indeed, such a fact, 
alone,  does  not  establish  an  asylum  claim.  In  addition  to  the  issue  of 
establishing a particular social group, receiving asylum requires fulfilling 
numerous other requirements, many of which are completely unrelated to the 
harm.424 Sessions’ assertion that A-R-C-G- incorrectly applied the law to 
create a “new” particular social group425 is thus an inaccurate analysis tainted

with political bias.426 In fact, A-R-C-G- properly used evidence, including 
evidence of the harm suffered by group members, to conduct the appropriate 
individualized analysis. A-B-’s attack on A-R-C-G- is instead an anomaly and 
a departure from established statutory construction and Board precedent, and 
the decision does not merit deference. 
 
C.  A-B- Oversteps the Limited Authority Delegated to the Executive 
 
Finally, A-B- is problematic because the decision’s substance and 
procedure both expand the role of the Attorney General in shaping the law in 
an area where Congress intended to place constraints on the prior, mostly-
unfettered  discretion  of  the  executive  in  conferring  asylum.427  Indeed, 
members of Congress from both the House and Senate asserted that they were 
concerned that the executive branch had subsumed the role of Congress in 
refugee policy.428 They were adamant that Congress retain a larger role in 
determining who would be admitted as a refugee and saw the Refugee Act—
the legislation that introduced “particular social group” to U.S. law—as an 
attempt to “to establish a proper balance between the executive and the 
legislative branches” regarding procedures for refugee admission.429 
  However, Sessions largely ignored Congress’ intent in interpreting 
particular  social  group  in  A-B-  and  instead  set  out  to  upend  various 
established tenets of asylum law. As he stated, the decision “elaborates 
upon”—that is, adds to—the statutory requirements as previously interpreted 
to determine whether a particular social group is cognizable.430 As described 
in the preceding sections, the decision attempts to foreclose the claims of 
groups  of  people  fleeing  modern  humanitarian  crises  such  as  domestic 
violence and gang violence. The decision purports to limit groups by size and 
oblige those who were persecuted by private actors to meet new, higher 
hurdles than the statute requires to show government acquiescence. This 
unilateral expansion of some and contraction of other requirements to meet 
                                                 
426 See, e.g., Sessions statements around family separation and asylum seekers prior 
to his issuance of A-B-, in which he accused those fleeing grave violence in Central America 
as making a “reckless and improper” choice to seek safety in the United States. Sarah

the particular social group term must be seen by a reviewing court as agency 
overreach,  flouting  Congressional  intent  to  curb  such  extensive 
reinterpretation of the law by the agency. 
A reviewing court should take into account the specific legislative 
history that demonstrates that the inclusion of the term particular social group 
was part of a congressional effort to limit the overreach of the executive 
branch.  Both  A-B-’s  substance  and  procedural  posture  indicate  that  the 
Attorney General has issued a decision that does not comport with the 
reasonable  interpretation  requirement  of  Chevron  step  two,  and  courts 
confronted with a case dealing with particular social group should decline to 
defer to A-B-. 
 
CONCLUSION 
 
Matter of A-B- was not only a source of concern and outrage in the public 
view—it is also legally concerning because it misinterprets the law.  In 
considering a case relying on A-B-, reviewing courts need not and should not 
defer to the Attorney General’s incorrect interpretations of particular social 
group. Indeed, denying deference would be both in alignment with scholarly 
concerns about overuse of Chevron in asylum cases431 and consistent with 
the current trend away from affording deference to agency decisions.432 
In Part II, this Article analyzed particular social group, the component 
of the refugee definition that previous case law had established as a viable 
category for victims of domestic violence. Parts III and IV provide a road 
map of the major departures of A-B-, arguing that the case is invalid at both 
step one and step two of Chevron for specific reasoning and policy put forth 
in the case. We conclude that Circuit Courts of Appeal need not uphold a case 
that relies upon A-B- in interpreting particular social group.
