I.  INTRODUCTION
Debates on protection for  famous trademarks  often center  around state
and federal antidilution laws. Both the old Federal Trademark Dilution Act
of 1995 and the new Trademark Dilution Revision Act of 2006 have generated
many law review articles and numerous symposia.1  The dilution law focuses
on  trademarks  deemed  famous  within  U.S.  boundaries.  A  debate  on
protection for famous trademarks today is incomplete without a discussion of
the other famous marks doctrine. The other famous marks doctrine recognizes
marks famous in other countries  without actual use in the country where a
user adopts the trademark on similar goods and services.
In the age of globalization,  both goods and people  move across  national
borders.  Moreover,  in the  age  of the  internet,  people  move in cyberspace,
transcending  physical  borders;  as  people  move,  they  carry  with  them
knowledge about certain trademarks and the associated reputation embodied
in  those trademarks.  A trademark  famous  outside the United  States, but
known  only  to  a  certain  segment  of  the U.S.  population  due  to  peoples'

movements across borders, prompts a discussion on whether the consuming
public  should be  protected  from the likelihood  of confusion  or fraud.  Until
now, U.S. courts never have recognized a famous marks doctrine because it is
a  doctrine  that  originates  from  international  treaties,  such  as  the  Paris
Convention for  the  Protection  of Industrial Property  ("Paris  Convention")2
and  the  Agreement  on  Trade  Related  Aspects  of  Intellectual  Property
("TRIPs").3 Although the United States is a signatory to both, these treaties
are  not  self-executing  and  so  do  not automatically  become  a part  of U.S.
domestic law. This Article will focus on U.S. courts' treatment of the famous
marks doctrine, particularly  the recent split between the Second and Ninth
Circuits on this issue. The split epitomizes two opposite views on fame:  use
and territoriality. On the one hand, the Second Circuit's approach ignores the
fame a foreign mark has attained outside the United States and recognizes
trademark rights only if the mark is in use in the United States. On the other
hand, the  Ninth  Circuit  embraces  the  possibility that  the fame  a foreign
mark  attains  outside  the  United  States  may  be  known  by  the  relevant
consumer within  the  United  States,  and hence  recognizes  that trademark
rights may exist to protect the consumer from confusion.4 Neither approach
leads to satisfactory  results. The bright-line  rejection  of the  famous marks
doctrine  by the  Second  Circuit  because  of the  treaty-based  nature  of the
doctrine places the United States in a position contrary to other countries. 5
However, the Ninth  Circuit's public-policy-based embrace  of the doctrine for
the purpose of protecting consumers may open doors to a new uncertainty in
the requirement of the foreign marks' fame. This Article ultimately concludes
that courts should  not act  as  legislative  bodies  concerning  the law  on the
famous marks doctrine, instead leaving the issue to Congress.
II.  FAMOUS MARKS DOCTRINE AND THE CIRCUIT SPLIT
Trademarks  are territorial. Indeed, a trademark symbolizes  the goodwill
cultivated  by the trademark  holder  within  a  territory that its  consuming
public  recognizes  and  from  which  it  expects  consistency  within  that
territory.6 Under the territoriality principle, a trademark is treated as having

an  independent  existence  in  each  nation  in  which  the  trademark  is
recognized and protected.7 Due to this independent existence, ownership of a
mark in one country does not provide ownership of and rights to the mark in
another country.8  One exception to the territoriality  principle is the famous
marks doctrine of the Paris Convention and TRIPs. 9 A mark that is famous in
a country or countries  is also  recognized  and protected  in another country
even though the owner of the mark has not registered or used the trademark
in that country. 10
[A]  trademark has a separate legal existence under each country's laws, and
that its proper  lawful function is  not necessarily to  specify the  origin  or
manufacture of a good (although it may incidentally do that), but rather to
symbolize  the  domestic  goodwill  of the  domestic  markholder  so  that  the
consuming public may rely with an expectation of consistency on the domestic
reputation earned for the mark by its owner, and the owner of the mark may
be confident that his goodwill and reputation (the value of the mark) will not
be injured through use of the mark by others in domestic commerce.

protected in that country by a registration which would normally prevent the
registration or use of the conflicting mark.TRANSNATIONAL  LAW & CONTEMPORARY PROBLEMS [Vol. 17:757
Federal trademark law in the United States has long remained silent as
to the recognition of famous foreign marks.11  Although the Lanham Act has
an antidilution  provision  protecting trademarks  deemed famous  within the
United States,  no statutory provision squarely addresses whether  a famous
foreign  mark  is  entitled  to  trademark  protection  in  the  United  States.12
Recently,  the  Second  and  Ninth Circuits  have  rendered  decisions  on U.S.
protection  for  famous  foreign  marks,  adopting  opposite  approaches.  These
decisions, Grupo Gigante S.A. De C.V. v.D allo & Co, Inc.13 and ITC, Ltd. v.
Punchgini, Inc.,14  respectively  decided  by  the  Second  and  Ninth  Circuits,
demonstrate the struggle to develop  common law solutions in an area where
globalization and movements by people  pose challenges to the territoriality
principle in trademark law.
A.  Famous Marks Doctrine and Public Policy
In 2004, the Ninth Circuit, in Grupo Gigante v. Dallo, became the first
and only appellate court to accept the famous marks doctrine as an exception
to  the  territoriality  principle. 15  The  court  recognized  the  exception  as  a
matter of sound public policy. 16 The facts of Grupo Gigante unfold as follows.
In  1962,  more  than  forty years  before  the  litigation  began,  the  Grupo
Gigante  company  opened  its  first  grocery  stores  in  Mexico  City.17  Grupo
Gigante obtained trademark registration in Mexico and became a successful
chain of grocery stores with  100 stores located throughout different parts of
Mexico.' 8 In 1991, it opened six stores in Baja California, Mexico, and two in
Tijuana, near the U.S.-Mexican border. 19
11 Id.  (noting that  there  is no  federal  trademark  protection  for famous  foreign  marks and
observing that the first case that recognized the famous foreign mark in the United States was a

(N.Y.  Sup.  Ct.  1936)).  In  Maison Prunier, the  plaintiff  owned  "Maison  Prunier,"  a  Paris
restaurant with  a branch in London  and brought  an unfair  competition  action against  the
defendant for using the French trademark for its restaurant in New York. Id.  at 535-36. The
plaintiff prevailed even though it never had used the trademark in the United States. Although
there was no  "right to protection against the use of a trade-mark or trade name beyond the
territory in which it operates," the New York court recognized "an exception to the rule" where
the second user was guilty of bad faith. Id. at 557-58.

incorporate "a famous marks exception into federal unfair competition law").

19 Id.Fall 2008] THE OTHER FAMous MARKS DOCTRINE
In  1991,  Michael  Dallo  selected  the  name  "Gigante  Market"  for  his
grocery store in San Diego, and five years later, in 1996, he and his brothers
opened  another  "Gigante  Market"  in  the  same  city.20  Meanwhile,  Grupo
Gigante  explored  the  possibility  of  expanding  its  grocery  stores  into  the
southern  region  of  California  and  learned  about  the  Dallos'  "Gigante
Market."21 Grupo Gigante met with the Dallos, but failed to persuade them to
cease  using the trademark "GIGANTE"  for their grocery stores.22 Both Grupo
Gigante  and the  Dallos  each  obtained  trademark  registration for  GIGANTE
from the state of California, but neither sought to register the mark with the
United States Patent and Trademark Office.23
In 1999, Grupo Gigante  opened its first U.S. GIGANTE  store and followed
with two more stores by 2000 in the Los Angeles area. 24 Upon learning about
the opening of the Gigante  store, the Dallos sent a cease-and-desist letter to
Grupo Gigante, demanding that Grupo Gigante stop using the GIGANTE name
for its grocery stores.25 Grupo Gigante responded by filing a suit against the
Dallos  for improper  use  of its well-known  GIGANTE  mark  protected  under
Articles  6bis and l0bis of the Paris Convention, false designation  of origin,
and misrepresentation  and unfair competition under § 43(a) of the Lanham
Act, among other claims.26 The district court ruled in favor of Grupo Gigante
and the Dallos appealed the case to the Ninth Circuit.27
At  the  outset,  the  Ninth  Circuit  acknowledged  that  the  territoriality
principle is the bedrock of trademark law because trademark rights exist in a
country  solely  in  accordance  to  that  country's  law.28  The  territoriality
principle  dictates that priority of trademark rights depends upon use of the
trademark in the United States and not use in other countries. Consequently,
the court observed, despite the fact that Grupo Gigante had used the GIGANTE
mark in Mexico for  decades before the Dallos  began its use of the  mark in
San Diego,  the Dallos would have priority over Grupo Gigante  in the mark
GIGANTE for grocery stores in the United States.29

The  Ninth  Circuit,  however,  emphatically  announced  that  "there  is  a
famous  mark  exception  to  the  territoriality  principle."30  Although  the
territoriality  principle  is  a  "long-standing  and  important  doctrine"  in
trademark  law,  "it cannot  be  absolute."31 The  court  explained  that  an
absolute territoriality  rule,  without an  exception  for famous  marks, would
"promote  consumer  confusion and fraud."32 It  recognized  that today  people
and commerce  move across  borders, and that this is especially true in the
United States as a nation of immigrants.33 Because the purpose of trademark
law is to protect against consumer  confusion  and palming off, there "can be
no justification for using trademark law to fool immigrants into thinking that
they are buying from the store they liked back home."34 The appellate court
then instructed the district court to apply a new standard to determine how
famous  a  mark  must  be  to  qualify  for the  exception  to  the  territoriality
principle.35  In  summary,  the  Ninth  Circuit  recognized  the  famous  mark
exception based on public policy.
Most importantly, the Ninth Circuit did not rely on the Paris Convention
in  recognizing  the  famous  mark  exception  to  the territoriality  principle.36
Indeed, the circuit did not reference the language of any article in the Paris
Convention  to  support  its  recognition  of  the  famous  marks  doctrine.37  It
affirmed the district court's dismissal of the plaintiffs claims of trademark
rights  under the Paris Convention and declared that the Paris Convention
creates  no "additional substantive rights" to those provided by the Lanham
Act.38 The circuit sidestepped any potential conflicts of law between the Paris
Convention and the Lanham Act with respect to the famous mark exception

36 The Second Circuit in Punchgini acknowledged that the Ninth Circuit in Grupo Gigante had
stated that the Paris Convention does not provide any substantive protection for trademarks
beyond the federal Lanham Act. ITC, Ltd. v.  Punchgini, Inc.,  482 F.3d  135,  162-63 (2d  Cir.

B. Famous Marks Doctrine and Bright-Line Rejection
More than thirty years ago, before  the Bukhara trademark  dispute, the
Bukhara  restaurant  opened  in  the  Maurya  Sheraton  &  Towers,  an
international  five-star  hotel  located  in  New  Delhi.41 After  the  successful
opening, the owners expanded the reach of the Bukhara trademark in many
major cities  worldwide,  including Hong Kong, Bangkok, Bahrain, Montreal,
Bangladesh, Singapore, Kathmandu, Ajman, New York, and Chicago.42 The
London-based  Restaurant magazine named  Bukhara as  one  of the world's
fifty best restaurants in 2003.43
The Bukhara restaurant opened in New York City and Chicago in 1986
and  1987,  respectively.44  The  owners  sought  and  received  trademark
registrations  for  their  restaurants  in  1987.45  The  Bukhara  restaurant  in
Manhattan operated for five years and closed its doors in 1991.46 The Chicago
Bukhara survived  longer and closed down  after ten years in operation, on
December 17, 1997.47 As of 2004, Bukhara restaurants operated only in New
Delhi, Singapore, Kathmandu, and Ajman.48
As  the Bukhara  restaurants  began  to close,  the owners  explored  the
possibility of distributing packaged, ready-to-serve foods under the Bukhara
label, "Dal Bukhara," in 2001.49 In 2003, the owners began selling their food
through two distributors in California and New Jersey.50 That same year, the
owners exhibited their  "Dal Bukhara" products at the  International Fancy
Foods Show in New York City.51

During the same time period, Vicky Vij, a former employee  at the New
York Bukhara restaurant teamed up with Raja Jhanjee,  Dhandu Ram, and
Paragnesh Desai to open Bukhara  Grill restaurants  in 1999.52 Vij, Jhanjee,
and Ram also previously had worked at the New Delhi Bukhara restaurant.53
The four individuals,  along  with their  business partners, incorporated  the
first company, Punchgini, to open the Bukhara Grill and the second company,
Bukhara Grill II, Inc., for the opening of the second restaurant in New York
City, Bukhara Grill 11.54
The defendants admitted that they purposely selected the name because
the original New York Bukhara restaurant had closed.55 Defendants copied
the authentic Bukhara restaurant's "logos, decors, staff uniforms, wood-slab
menus, and red-checked customer bibs."56 Moreover, the defendants claimed
that their Bukhara  Grill restaurant "is quite  like Delhi's Bukhara."57 The
opening  of the  Bukhara Grill attracted  attention  from news reporters who
thought the restaurant was related to the famous Delhi's Bukhara.58
In early 2000, counsel for the owners of the original  Bukhara restaurant
sent cease-and-desist  letters  to the  defendants,  demanding  the  defendants
refrain  from using the BUKHARA  trademark and goodwill.59 Counsel for the
defendants asserted that the owners had abandoned their trademarks in the
United States. The parties corresponded but did not resolve  the dispute. In
early  2003,  the  owners  of  the  original  Bukhara  restaurant  brought  a
trademark infringement and unfair competition action under both the federal
Lanham Act6o and New York state laws against the defendants.61 The district

court  granted  defendants'  summary  judgment  motion,  finding  that  the
plaintiffs  could not sustain their claims because  they had abandoned their
BUKHARA trademark for restaurants in the United States.62
To overcome the defense of abandonment, the plaintiffs rested their case
on the famous marks  doctrine.63 The plaintiffs urged the  Second  Circuit to
recognize that their BUKHARA  mark was famous  and that they had priority
over  the  defendants  in  the  trademark.64  They  asserted  that  they  had
continuously  used and branded their BUKHARA  trademark in the last thirty
years  in  many  countries  and  that  their  trademark  was  renowned  in  the
United  States before the defendants  deliberately  copied the  Bukhara  name
and restaurant trade dress for their Bukhara Grill in New York City.65
The  Second  Circuit  in  ITC Ltd. v.  Punchgini, Inc. flatly  rejected  the
famous  marks  doctrine.66  The  Punchgini court  noted  that  although  the
Second  Circuit  had made references  to the  famous  marks  doctrine on  two
occasions,  neither of the two prior decisions required the court to determine
whether  it  must apply  the  doctrine.67  The  court observed  that the  Ninth
Circuit was the only federal appellate court that had recognized the famous
marks  doctrine "as a matter of sound policy,"  and  it declined  to follow  the
Ninth Circuit.68 The Second Circuit explained that the international treaties
for the protection of famous marks, the Paris Convention and TRIPs, are not
self-executing  and  the  Lanham  Act  remains  the  federal  law  governing
whether the owners of the original BUKHARA  trademark have priority rights
in  the United States.69  The court  examined  relevant  provisions under  the

The Second Circuit explicitly declined the plaintiffs' invitation to adopt a
policy-based  approach  for judicial recognition of the famous  marks  doctrine
under  federal  law.71  It noted  that  policy  arguments  can  be  persuasive  at
times, but in the context  of the Lanham Act,  which is comprehensive  and
frequently  amended by  Congress,  it is  not  appropriate  for  the judiciary  to
recognize  the  famous  marks  doctrine  as  an  exception  to  the  territoriality
doctrine.72  Congress  is  the  body  to  decide  "whether  and  under  what
circumstances to accord federal recognition  to such an exception to the basic
principle of territoriality."73
The  Second  Circuit's  decision  in  Punchgini and  the  Ninth  Circuit's
decision  in  Grupo  Gigante epitomize  the  two  opposite  views  on  U.S.
protection for famous foreign trademarks.  Punchgini represents  a steadfast
adherence  to the U.S.  use requirement  in U.S. territory while  ignoring the
fame  of the foreign  trademark.  Grupo Gigante recognizes  the  fame of the
foreign trademark transmitted through the migration of people who recognize
and expect consistency from the mark, even  though there is no use of that
particular mark within U.S. territory. Both decisions  demonstrate how U.S.
courts struggle with fame, use, and territoriality in addressing trademarks in
the age of increasing globalization.74

III.  FAME, USE, AND TERRITORIALITY
A.  Use and Territoriality:F  orget Fame
Both  the Second  and the  Ninth Circuits  agreed  that the  territoriality
principle  is fundamental  to  trademark  rights. They agreed  that under the
territoriality  principle, without use  of the  foreign trademark  in the United
States,  there will be  no  trademark  rights.75  There  are  numerous  possible
examples of trademark use.76 Obviously, having the mark affixed to products
in the stream of commerce constitutes use.77 Also, having a website with the
mark as a source identifier for the content provided at the website constitutes
use.78  Even mere advertisement of the trademark in the United States while
offering  the  actual  products  for  sale  outside the  United  States  also  may
satisfy  the  use  requirement.79  Whoever  uses  the  mark  first  will  have
priority.80  Whoever files an intent-to-use federal  trademark application first
also can claim priority.8' Without either using the mark or filing an intent-to-
use  application,  a  trademark  owner  cannot  establish  priority.  The
territoriality of trademark rights requires all domestic and foreign trademark
owners to follow U.S. law if they want to avail themselves of its protection for
their trademarks.
Both the Second and Ninth Circuits also agree that the Paris Convention
does  not  provide  additional  substantive  trademark  rights  and  that  the
Lanham Act remains the governing law for trademark rights in the United
States.82  Article  6bis  of  the  Paris  Convention  provides  a  famous  mark

78 Other examples of trademark use to establish priority under trademark law include prior use
of  a  term  in  advertising  brochures,  catalogues,  newspapers,  press  releases,  and  trade
publications. See Malcolm Nicol & Co. v. Witco Corp., 881 F.2d 1063, 1065 (Fed. Cir. 1989).

exception  protection, but the Paris Convention  itself only dictates signatory
members to provide national treatment. 83 The Lanham Act complies with the
Paris  Convention  by treating  domestic  and  foreign  trademark  owners the
same.  Foreign  trademark  owners  must  follow  the  Lanham  Act  just  as
domestic trademark owners do in order to receive trademark protection. The
Lanham  Act  imposes  the  use  requirement  on both  domestic  and  foreign
trademark  owners.84 That  means  that  the  territoriality  principle  governs
trademark rights in the United States.
The circuits'  views  on the territoriality  principle, however,  divert from
here. The Second Circuit took the view that regardless of the fame a foreign
trademark has attained outside the United States, if the foreign trademark is
not in use here, than no trademark rights exist in the United States.85 Also, if
the owner  of the famous  foreign  trademark  used the  mark in  the  United
States  for a period of time, but then ceased  to use it in the United  States
while continuing  to  use it outside  the  United  States, no trademark  rights
exist here since the owner abandoned the mark.88 Under the Second Circuit's
rule,  the  territoriality  principle  is  absolute.  There  is  no  exception  to  the
principle. Regardless  of the trademark's fame outside and inside the United
States, no use means no rights.
The  Ninth  Circuit  has  an entirely  different  view.  The  Ninth  Circuit's
approach that "territoriality . . . cannot be absolute" means that use of the
mark in the United States is not required for protection87 as long as the mark
itself, through  use  outside  the  United  States,  is  known  by  people  in  the
United States.8  8
Indeed, if the foreign trademark is known by people in the United States
who believe  that the American junior user's mark is the same as  a foreign
trademark,  an  exception  to  the  territoriality  principle  applies.89  In  other

THE OTHER FAMous MARKS DOCTRINE
words,  if the  fame  of  the  foreign  trademark  reaches  the  United  States
because of people migrating across national borders, the trademark remains
protected,  in order to prevent confusion  as  to the  source.  The fame  of the
trademark, according  to  the  Ninth  Circuit, is not the  typical  fame  in the
federal trademark dilution law, based on years of sales of goods or extensive
advertisements bearing the trademark in the United States.90 The concept of
fame, as recognized by the Ninth Circuit, depends on the movements  of the
people who recognize the mark.91
The  Ninth  Circuit  relies  on  the  main  purpose  of  trademark  law,
protecting consumers from source confusion, but allows the law to bend the
territoriality  principle.  However,  its  approach  necessitates  an  extensive
factual inquiry as to fame. How famous must a foreign mark be in order to
justify a departure from the territoriality principle? What is the standard to
measure  fame?  Should  the  fame  of the  foreign  mark for the  territoriality
exception require niche fame or a heightened level of fame as required under
the federal trademark antidilution law? We turn now to these questions.
B. Forget Use and Territoriality,b ut Retain Fame
Generally,  a  trademark  garners  its  fame  through  extensive  sales  and
advertisement  of the goods  in commerce.  Over time, the  consuming public
may  come  to  recognize  the  trademark  within  a  particular  industry  or  a
9o For examples of niche fame requiring substantial sales and advertisements, see generally Nina
Ricci, S.A.R.L.  v. E.T.F. Enters., Inc., 889 F.2d 1070, 1074 (Fed. Cir. 1989) (NINA  RICCI mark,
known for perfume, clothing, and accessories, was deemed famous within its niche based on $200
million in sales, $37 million in advertising, and more than 27 years of use); Kimberly-Clark Corp.
v. H. Douglas Enter., Ltd., 774 F.2d 1144, 1145-46 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (stating the fame of HUGGIES
trademark, known for its diapers, was based on $300 million of sales in a nine-year period and
annual advertisements of $15  million); Specialty Brands, Inc. v.  Coffee Bean Distribs., Inc., 748
F.2d 669, 674 (Fed. Cir. 1984) (noting that the SPICE ISLANDS  trademark for teas, spices, and
seasonings was in use for forty years and garnered sales of $25 million annually); Giant Food,
Inc. v. Nation's Foodservice, Inc., 710 F.2d 1565, 1571 (Fed. Cir. 1983) (stating that the fame of
the trademark GIANT FOOD, known for supermarkets, was based on sales over $1 billion annually
and its use for forty-five years).
91T he Ninth Circuit provided an example about fame dependent on the movement of the people
as follows:
It might not matter if someone visiting Fairbanks, Alaska from Wellington,
New Zealand  saw a cute hair-salon name-"Hair Today,  Gone Tomorrow,"
'Mane  Place," "Hair on Earth," 'Mary's  Hair'em," or "Shear Heaven"-and
decided to use the name on her own salon back home in New Zealand. The
ladies in New Zealand would not likely think they were going to a branch of a
Fairbanks hair salon. But if someone opened a high-end salon with a red door
in  Wellington  and called  it Elizabeth Arden's, women  might very  well go
there because  they thought they were going to an affiliate of the Elizabeth
Arden chain, even if there had not been any other Elizabeth Ardens in New
Zealand prior to the salon's opening. If it was not an affiliate, just a local
store with  no connection,  customers  would be  fooled. The  real Elizabeth
Arden chain might lose business if word spread that the Wellington salon
was nothing special.

region. This means, through use, the trademark has achieved fame within a
niche.  To  qualify  for  antidilution  protection,  however,  a  trademark  must
achieve national fame,  not just niche fame.92 That is, the consuming public
nationwide must recognize the trademark in order for the trademark owner
to gain antidilution protection against a junior user of an identical or similar
trademark that causes tarnishment or blurring.93
In light of the fame requirement under the Federal Trademark Dilution
Revision Act of 2006, should the same standard be applied to famous foreign
mark  exceptions  to  the  territoriality  principle?  Before  exploring  possible
answers  to  this question,  the  famous  mark  exception  to  the  territoriality
must  first  be  recognized,  as  announced  by  the  Ninth  Circuit  in  Grupo
Gigante. In other words, use in the United States is not of concern, and fame
becomes the main inquiry.
The  Ninth  Circuit  ruled  that  when  foreign  use of a  mark  achieves  a
certain  level of fame  within  the  United  States,  the territoriality  principle
does not bar that mark from claiming priority over the earlier foreign use. 94
Yet, how is  fame measured  in this context?  The  district court  applied  the
secondary  meaning  test  and found  that  the  GIGANTE  mark  had  achieved
secondary  meaning  in the  geographical  area where  the  plaintiff wished to
assert protection.95 The Ninth Circuit rejected the district court's approach,
stating  that "secondary  meaning is  not enough" and  ruled that  additional
tests  are  required  in  order  for  the  foreign  trademark  to  qualify  as  an
exception to the territoriality principle.96
92 See 15 U.S.C. § 1125(c)(2)(A) (2006) (defining a famous trademark as one that "is widely
recognized by the general consuming public of the United States as a designation of source of the
goods or services of the mark's owner"). See also Top Tobacco, L.P. v. North Atlantic Operating
Co., Inc., 509 F.3d 380 (7th Cir. 2007).
93 In considering whether  a mark is famous for the federal trademark antidilution protection,
courts may consider the following factors:
(i) The duration, extent, and geographic reach of advertising and publicity of
the mark, whether advertised or publicized by the owner or third parties.
(ii) The amount, volume, and geographic extent of sales of goods or services
offered under the mark.
(iii) The extent of actual recognition of the mark.
(iv) Whether the mark was registered under the Act of March 3, 1881, or the
Act of February 20, 1905, or on the principal register.

95 Id.  at 1095 (noting that the district court held that "the correct inquiry ...  was to determine
whether the mark had attained secondary meaning in the San Diego area").
96 Id. at 1098.Fall 2008] THE OTHER FAMous MARKS DOCTRINE
The Ninth Circuit ruled that when a foreign mark has never been used in
the United States,  the trademark holder  must establish that "a substantial
percentage  of consumers  in the relevant American  market is  familiar with
the foreign  mark."97 The relevant American  market is the geographic area
where the defendant uses the trademark.98 The Ninth Circuit instructed that
the district court should consider factors related to consumer  confusion and
fraud, such as the intentional copying of the mark by the defendant and the
likelihood  that the defendant's  customers  think that they are  "patronizing
the same firm that uses the mark in another country."99
The  "substantial  percentage"  phrase,  however,  leaves  wide  open  for
interpretation  the  precise  meaning  of  the requirement.  Does  it mean less
than  20  percent,  50  percent,  or  more  than  50  percent?  Even  if  the
"substantial percentage" means more than 50 percent, the fame requirement
for the exception to the territoriality  principle, as announced  by the  Ninth
Circuit, is  only  niche  fame  because  it  is known  only  within  the  relevant
geographic  area where  the U.S. company  uses  the foreign  trademark.  The
mark need not be known to the general consuming public. That means the
requirement is higher than necessary for protection in a domestic trademark
infringement  and  unfair  competition  case.  On  the  other  hand,  that  also
means  the  requirement  is  lower  than  the  level  of fame  required  for  the
trademark antidilution protection. The requirement is an intermediate level
of fame.
Consequently, the "substantial percentage" of consumers in the relevant-
market  requirement  may  be  established  mainly  by  survey  evidence  of
recognition,  rather than by use of the trademark in the United  States. The
public perception in the relevant U.S. market without the trademark owner's
actual  use of the trademark  in  commerce  means that the  traditional  use-
based  proof-such  as  evidence  of sales  of  products  in  the  United  States,
advertisements of the products in the United States, and market expansion
history in the United States-are not available.
IV.  CONCLUSION: A LEGISLATIVE, NOT JUDICIAL, SOLUTION
The Second and Ninth Circuits' conflicting decisions on the famous marks
doctrine  exception  to the  territoriality  principle  may lead one  to  speculate
that the United  States  Supreme  Court  may accept  a certiorari petition  to
address the issue. Although the Court has been eager to hear other types of
intellectual property cases, such as patent cases, and to overturn the Federal
Circuit's  decisions,  it  has  declined  to  accept  certiorari  for  ITC  Ltd.  v.

Punchgini, Inc..100  The  Supreme  Court  was  wise  to  deny  the  certiorari
petition.
Congress can best address the issue of whether the Lanham Act should
be amended to provide recognition of famous foreign marks. Currently, U.S.
trademark  law  is  at  odds  with  numerous  countries  that  recognize  and
incorporate  the  famous  marks  doctrine  into  their  trademark  law.101
Understanding  the  influence  of  trademark  owners  on  the  direction  of
trademark law in the United States, Congress most likely will not tackle the
famous marks doctrine if the International Trademark  Association ("INTA")
does  not  initiate  the  amendment  efforts  and endorse  it.102  INTA  may not
express interest in having U.S. law provide an exception to the territoriality
principle because owners of known global trademarks have already registered
their marks  in  the  United  States,  and  the  United  States  is  a  large  and
important  market  of foreign  goods and services.  The  fact that the famous
marks doctrine has not become an important issue of concern to trademark
owners for more than sixty years  may reinforce the belief that the Lanham
Act, as amended numerous times, does not need to address the famous marks
doctrine. 103
INTA, as the largest organization of trademark owners worldwide,1 04 and
Congress  should  study  and  decide whether  to  amend  the  Lanham Act  to
accept the famous marks doctrine. Cases in the Trademark Trial and Appeal
Board,  state  courts,  and  federal  courts  all  encounter  the  famous  marks
doctrine. Most federal  decisions avoided  addressing the doctrine  directly.105
As the Second  Circuit in Punchgini noted, every  lower court or state court
recognizing  the  doctrine  has  based  its decision  mainly  on  state  common
law.106 Cases with claims based on the famous marks doctrine, however, will

in cyberspace,  with several billion websites allowing internet users to cross
invisible national borders to conduct communication and transact businesses
with  a  click  of  a  mouse.107  Consequently,  the  famous  marks  doctrine
exception becomes more appealing to protect consumers from being misled as
