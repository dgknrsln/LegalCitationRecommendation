I. Introduction 
Despite having a cheap and capable labor force, it costs more 
to produce a jacket for export in a poor, developing country than it 
costs  to  produce  the  same  jacket  in  China.    This  revelation 
surprises many.  The lack of access to credit is identified as one of 
the main reasons for the disparity in production costs.  Indeed, the 
New York Times reported that in 2006, it cost a company in Laos 
45% more than it cost a Chinese company to ship each container 
of jackets to the United States.1  The “virtually nonexistent credit 
markets”2 in Laos caused the high production costs for businesses 
trying to compete in the global market.3  Businesses could not 
utilize “[their] factory and equipment as collateral for loans in 
Laos’ modest banking market, making it costly and difficult to 
borrow.”4  As a result, Laotian goods could not compete with those 
made in China.  A neighbor of Laos, Vietnam, faced a similar 
challenge and decided to transplant secured transactions law in 
Vietnam in 1995 and again in 2005.5 
Despite  the  bragging  right  of  having  implemented  secured 
transactions law in Vietnam almost two decades ago, Vietnamese 
businesses  continue  to  lack  access  to  credit,  and  the  secured

financing market is underdeveloped.6  A closer examination of the 
current secured transactions law in Vietnam reveals that Vietnam 
did not follow the international best practices when adopting its 
own secured transactions law.  As a result, Vietnam transplanted 
an  antiquated,  opaque,  and  incomplete  body  of  secured 
transactions law and trapped secured transactions law deep inside 
a copiously webbed Civil Code. 
During the early 2000s, the United Nations Commission on 
International Trade Law (UNCITRAL)7 convened in Vienna and 
New  York  City  to  draft  a  comprehensive,  clear,  and  concise 
international guide for secured transactions to encourage credit 
availability.8  Disregarding the international community’s efforts, 
Vietnam  charted  its  own  course  in  designing  its  secured 
transactions law.9 
Vietnam, believing that civil law offers the best approach to 
creating secured transactions law, adopted the approach, structure, 
and  provisions  that  international  communities  had  already 
acknowledged as antiquated.  In fact, the international community 
had already replaced this antiquated system with the UNCITRAL 
Legislative Guide.  Rather than following the international  trend, 
Vietnam  consulted  experts  from  other  civil  law  countries  and 
transplanted  their  antiquated  system  into  its  own  secured 
transactions law.  Thus, Vietnam’s secured transactions laws were 
 
  6  Most businesses in Vietnam have been experiencing the long-term problem of 
lacking credit.  See Lack of Credit Hampers SMEs, VIÊT NAM NEWS (Sept. 18, 2010, 
9:46  AM),  http://vietnamnews.vn/economy/203785/lack-of-credit-hampers-smes.html 
(reporting that Vietnamese businesses cited the lack of credit as their biggest problem). 
  7  UNCITRAL was established by the United Nations General Assembly by its 
Resolution 2205 (XXI) of 17 December 1966 “for the promotion of the progressive 
harmonization and unification of the law of international trade.”  G.A. Res. 2205 (XXI), 
U.N. GAOR, 21st Sess., Supp. No. 16, U.N. Doc. A/6594, at 5 (Dec. 17, 1966).  In 2001, 
UNCITRAL established Working Group VI “with the mandate to develop an efficient 
legal regime for security rights in goods involved in a commercial activity, including 
inventory.”  Sandra M. Rocks & Kate A. Sawyer, Survey of International Commercial 
Law Developments During 2002, 58 BUS. LAW. 1657, 1661 (2003).  Working Group VI 
met regularly in New York City and Vienna to develop the Legislative Guide on Secured 
Transactions completed in 2007.  See Sandra M. Rocks & Kate A. Sawyer, International 
Commercial Law: 2007 Developments, 63 BUS. LAW. 1375, 1380 (2008). 
  8  See UNCITRAL, LEGISLATIVE GUIDE ON SECURED TRANSACTIONS, U.N. Sales 
No. E.09.V.12 (2007) [hereinafter LEGISLATIVE GUIDE]. 
  9  Vietnam is not a member of UNCITRAL.  See UNCITRAL, Origin, Mandate, 
and  Composition  of  UNCITRAL  (2014),  http://www.uncitral.org/uncitral/en/about 
/origin.html. 4  N.C. J. INT'L L. & COM. REG.  Vol. XL 
outdated before they were even enacted.10 
As a result, Vietnam’s secured transactions law cannot keep 
pace  with  the  ever-changing  daily  practices  related  to  secured 
transactions. As individuals and businesses turn to movable assets 
for financing due to the shrinkage of the credit market based on 
real estate or immovable property, Vietnam’s secured transactions 
laws fail to facilitate the availability of credit through secured 
financing.11  For example, one debtor owed over $28 million to 
several lenders, and each lender received a security interest in the 
debtor’s coffee inventory stored in the same warehouse.12  One 
lender went separately to court for a judgment to seize some of the 
inventory, while other lenders vigorously opposed.13  All lenders 
sent  in  troops,  trucks,  and  guards  to  encircle  the  warehouse,14 
where fighting and violence ensued.  Police officers were deployed 
to  maintain  order.15    In  the  end,  when  access  to  the  coffee 
inventory  was  allowed,  it  was  discovered  that  the  existing 
inventory was only half the amount reported by the debtor.16 
This Article argues that Vietnam cannot and will not be able to 
promptly address similar problems and market concerns in secured 
financing  because  its  secured  transactions  law  is  structurally 
confined inside Vietnam’s Civil Code.  The Civil Code, Vietnam’s 
proud achievement, is a massive body of law that covers all “civil” 
transactions  and  matters.    The  vast  scope  of  the  Civil  Code 
includes  property  law,  torts  law,  contract  law,  family  law, 
employment law, wills and trust law, and secured transactions law,

all  under  one  roof.17    As  a  result,  the  Civil  Code  is 
incomprehensible on a practical level. 
Since  secured  transactions  are  viewed  as  “civil,”  secured 
transactions law is embedded inside Vietnam’s Civil Code.  Thus, 
Vietnam cannot amend secured transactions law without amending 
the entire Civil Code.  Amending the Civil Code is a task that 
Vietnam  is  not  willing  to  undertake  frequently.    Moreover, 
Vietnam  cannot  routinely  amend  the  Civil  Code  for  secured 
transactions law alone. 
Additionally, the placement of secured transactions law under 
the “Civil Obligations” part of the Civil Code fails to grasp that 
secured transactions include not only recognizing different and 
new  types  of  property  rights  and  interests,  but  also  allowing 
property rights and interests to be utilized as collateral in order to 
increase credit availability.18  Secured transactions are not merely 
“obligations.”    Situating  secured  transactions  law  under  “Civil 
Obligations” led to the creation of an incomplete body of law that 
lacked  fundamental  rules  relating  to  perfection,  priority,  and 
remedies of secured transactions.  Overall, the secured transactions 
law  is  antiquated,  opaque,  and  incomplete.19    Consequently, 
individuals  and  businesses  in  Vietnam  are  desperate  for  credit 
while  lenders  have  no  incentive  to  engage  in  meaningful  and 
enforceable financing. 
It is time for Vietnam to amend its secured transactions law by 
creating a body of secured transactions law separate from the Civil 
Code.    This  new  secured  transactions  law  should  embody  the 
international community’s unitary approach.  Separating secured 
transactions law from the Civil Code would allow Vietnam to 
revise its secured transactions law to respond and adapt to market 
reality, without waiting for the entire Civil Code to be revised all 
at once. 
This  Article  will  proceed  as  follows.    Part  I  provides  an 
overview of the international best practices in secured transactions, 
discussing UNCITRAL’s Legislative Guide and Article 9 of the 
Uniform  Commercial  Code.    Part  II  explores  why  and  how 
 
  17  See generally CODE CIV. [C. CIV.] (Viet.) (encompassing property law, torts law, 
contract law, family law, employment law, wills and trust law, and secured transactions 
law). 
  18  See infra Part II. 
  19  See infra Part IV. 6  N.C. J. INT'L L. & COM. REG.  Vol. XL 
Vietnam adopted a massive and incomprehensible Civil Code in 
the  twenty-first  century.    Part  III  discusses  the  placement  of 
secured transactions law inside the Civil Code and the problems 
associated with such placement.  Part IV analyzes and critiques 
Vietnam’s secured transactions law as antiquated and opaque.  Part 
V  demonstrates  the  fundamental  rules  currently  missing  in 
Vietnam’s  secured  transactions  law  and  how  Vietnamese 
businesses are suffering as a result of this incomplete body of 
secured transactions law.  Part VI considers a number of solutions, 
from using government decrees to circumvent the existing law to 
moving the secured transactions law from the “Civil Obligations” 
part to the “Property Ownership” part of the Civil Code.  Part VI 
also  analyzes  and  discusses  potential  problems  associated  with 
these  solutions.  Ultimately,  Part  VI  concludes  that  the  best 
solution  would  be  for  Vietnam  to  create  a  body  of  secured 
transactions law distinct from the Civil Code. 
Vietnam’s experience of transplanting secured transactions law 
is not unique and is illustrative of “civil law” emerging economy 
countries.    This  Article  concludes  that  transplanting  law, 
specifically  commercial  and  financing  law,  requires  emerging 
economies, including Vietnam, to reevaluate the belief that the 
“civil law” countries’ approach is the best, particularly since this 
approach has already been proven to be antiquated, opaque, and 
incomplete by the international community.20 
 
  20  Numerous writings have discussed different legal transplant theories; therefore, 
it is unnecessary for this Article to reiterate these theories.  For an overview of legal 
transplant literature, see JOHN STANLEY GILLESPIE, TRANSPLANTING COMMERCIAL LAW 
REFORM: DEVELOPING A RULE OF LAW IN VIETNAM 18–26 (2006) (outlining four major 
theories to legal transplants: (1) legal evolution; (2) limited legal autonomy; (3) legal 
autonomy; and (4) systems theory).  The legal evolution theory, proposed by Sir Henry 
Main and Max Weber, asserts that less developed legal systems will evolve to emulate 
more developed legal systems.  See id. at 18–19.  The limited legal autonomy theory, 
developed by Montesquieu, Pierre Legrand, and Otto Kahn-Freund, argues that law is 
socially and culturally embedded and thus can only be somewhat transferred from one 
country to another, depending on the extent of relationship between the transplanted rule 
with its original country, or it may not be transferable at all.  See id. at 20–22.  Alan 
Watson, the architect of the extreme legal autonomy theory, maintains that law is 
transferrable “freely across cultural barriers.”  Id. at 23.  The systems theory, devised by 
Gunther  Teubner  and  Niklas  Luhmann,  “provides  a  point  of  departure  from  the 
previously discussed state-centered theories,” and avers that “people within institutions 
such as companies, political bodies or universities create their own kind of reality and 
meanings.”  Id. at 24.  However, none of the above general theories provides a 
satisfactory analytical framework to evaluate the viability of legal transplant.  This 2014  TRANSPLANTING SECURED TRANSACTION LAW  7 
II. An Overview of The International Best Practices in 
Secured Transactions 
The UNCITRAL Legislative Guide on Secured Transactions 
(“Legislative Guide”), which was adopted in 200721 and modeled 
after  Article  9  of  the  Uniform  Commercial  Code  (“UCC”),22 
represents the international best practices and epitomizes a modern 
secured  transactions  regime.23    Although  secured  transactions 
captured  the  attention  of  UNCITRAL  and  other  international 
 
Article thereby identifies the current problem of transplanting secured transaction law in 
Vietnam and proposes solutions in response to the concerns of stakeholders affected by 
such law. 
  21 See LEGISLATIVE GUIDE, supra note 8. 
  22 See Spyridon V. Bazinas, Senior Legal Officer, UNCITRAL Secretariat, The 
Influence  of  the  UNCITRAL  Legislative  Guide,  4  (Nov.  5,  2013),  available  at 
http://www.ebrd.com/downloads/legal/secured/bazinas1t.pdf. 
  23 Obviously, the Legislative Guide and Article 9 of the UCC are not flawless, but 
they codify best practices in the financing industry and make significant contributions to 
the reforms of secured transactions laws worldwide and the improvement of access to 
credit.  This Article does not purport to analyze the shortcomings of the Legislative 
Guide and Article 9.  For critiques of Article 9, see, e.g., Robert K. Rasmussen, The 
Uneasy Case Against the Uniform Commercial Code, 62 LA. L. REV. 1097, 1100–01 
(2002) (summarizing the scholarship attacking Article 9, including the assertion that 
“Article 9 encouraged inefficient investment,” and that contractual priority can generate 
benefit for society without Article 9); Steven L. Harris & Charles W. Mooney, Jr., Using 
First Principles of UCC Article 9 to Solve Statutory Puzzles in Receivables Financing,

Article 9 and related non-UCC law is unclear); Thomas E. Plank, Assignment of 
Receivables Under Article 9: Structural Incoherence and Wasteful Filing, 68 OHIO ST. 
L.J. 231, 231 (2007) (arguing that “Article 9’s treatment of the assignment of receivables 
has produced a variety of calamities for both the drafters and the users of Article 9.”); 
Paul M. Shupack, The Assignee of an Article 9 Security Interest: Two Sets of Drafting 
Errors and How to Live with Them, 46 GONZ. L. REV. 503, 504 (2011) (noting that 
“[c]ertain provisions of Article 9 fail to produce sensible results” with respect to 
assignment  of  security  interests);  Xuan-Thao  Nguyen,  Collateralizing  Intellectual 
Property, 42 GA. L. REV. 1, 32–37 (2007) (criticizing Article 9’s overly broad definition 
of “general intangibles,” which fails to provide notice to secured party and the debtor 
that intellectual property is encumbered).  For critiques of the Legislative Guide, see, 
e.g., John J. Chung, A Fundamental Flaw with UNCITRAL’s Approach to Cross-Border 
Secured Transactions: The Failure to Address Creditor Due Diligence Issues, 20 AM. 
BANKR. INST. L. REV. 557, 563 (2012) (contending that “the Legislative Guide is a pale 
imitation, at best, of Article 9, and cannot achieve what Article 9 has achieved,” and 
questioning “whether the Legislative Guide is necessary at all”); Haider Ala Hamoudi, 
The American Commercial Religion, 10 DEPAUL BUS. & COM. L.J. 107, 148 (2012)

failure to “prevent the law from creating preferences over secured creditors as to secured 
property”). 8  N.C. J. INT'L L. & COM. REG.  Vol. XL 
institutions back in the late 1970s,24 UNCITRAL did not resume 
its work on devising an international legal framework for secured 
transactions until 2001.25  The global problem of obtaining credit 
due  to  deficient  domestic  secured  transactions  laws  prompted 
UNCITRAL to restart this grand project.26  Moreover, with the 
arrival of the Internet in the late 1990s, the world witnessed the 
emergence of new kinds of property that could serve as collateral.  
In 2001, the international community decided that the time was 
ripe to develop a comprehensive set of legal standards for secured 
transactions in the form of a legislative guide to assist legislatures 
worldwide  “in  developing  modern  secured  transactions  laws,” 
“with a view to promoting the availability of credit.”27 
The primary goal of modern secured transactions law is to 
promote low-cost credit by amplifying the availability of credit 
and allowing businesses and individuals to utilize the full value of 
their assets to obtain financing.28  To achieve this goal, modern 
secured  transactions  law  rejects  the  antiquated  approach  that 
distinguishes  among  security  devices  and  adopts  the  unitary 
approach  to  secured  transactions.    This  unitary  approach 
recognizes that all transactions that create a security interest in any 
type  of  asset  to  secure  an  obligation  are  considered  secured 
transactions, regardless of the name or form of the transaction, the 
type of collateral, the status of the debtor or secured party, or the

and “creating a competitive disadvantage for business parties who do not have sufficient 
access to lower-cost credit”).

nature of the secured obligation.29  Under the unitary approach, 
secured transactions law encompasses not only traditional security 
devices such as pledges and mortgages, but also transactions that 
are  typically  not  denominated  as  secured  transactions  but 
nevertheless serve security purposes.30  These transactions include 
sales with retention of title,31 financial leases,32 consignments,33 
and  sales  of  accounts.34    The  unitary  approach  “ensures 
comprehensiveness, consistency, and transparency”35 of secured 
transactions law, “promotes competition among credit providers 
by placing sellers, lessors, and lenders on a level playing field,”36 
and  reduces  creditors’  burden  in  investigating  the  different 
requirements of various security devices, thus lowering transaction 
costs overall.37 
With regard to property collateral, modern secured transactions 
law  allows  all  kinds  of  personal  property  to  be  utilized  as 
collateral: from tangible to intangible property, existing to after-
acquired  property,  and  original  collateral  to  proceeds  of 
collateral.38  Tangible property typically covers consumer goods, 
 
  29 See LEGISLATIVE GUIDE, supra note 8, ¶ 62, at 23; LEGISLATIVE GUIDE, supra 
note 8, Recommendation 2, at 61; U.C.C. § 9-109(a) (2010) (setting forth the scope of 
Article 9). 
  30 See LEGISLATIVE GUIDE, supra note 8, Recommendation 8, at 62; U.C.C. § 9-
109(a) (2010). 
  31 A sale with retention of title occurs when the seller sells goods on credit and the 
parties agree that ownership of the goods is not transferred from the seller to the buyer 
until payment is made in full.  See LEGISLATIVE GUIDE, supra note 8, Introduction, at 12. 
  32 A financial lease is a lease agreement under which, at the end of the lease, the 
lessee  automatically  becomes  the  owner  of  the  leased  property  and  may  acquire 
ownership by paying a nominal price, or the leased property has “no more than a nominal 
residual value.”  See LEGISLATIVE GUIDE, supra note 8, Introduction, at 9; see also 
U.C.C. § 1-203(b) (2001) (setting forth factors to determine whether a lease creates a 
security interest). 
  33 A consignment covered by secured transactions law is a transaction in which a 
person delivers goods for the purpose of sale to a merchant dealing in goods of that kind 
and the merchant “is not generally known by its creditors to be substantially engaged in 
selling the goods of others.”  U.C.C. § 9-102(20) (2010). 
  34 See LEGISLATIVE GUIDE, supra note 8, ¶ 25, at 37 (explaining that outright 
transfers of receivables are included in the scope of secured transactions); see also

inventory,  and  equipment.39    Tangible  property  also  includes 
fixtures,  which  are  “goods  that  have  become  so  related  to 
particular real property that an interest in them arises under real 
property law.”40  Quasi-tangible property, including instruments 
(such  as  checks,  promissory  notes,  or  bills  of  exchange),41 
documents of title (such as bills of lading or warehouse receipts),42 
chattel  paper,43  and  investment  property  (securities),44  can  also 
serve  as  collateral.    Intangible  property  encompasses  a  wide 
variety  of  rights  and  interests,  such  as  contractual  and  non-
contractual receivables, contractual non-monetary claims, deposit 
accounts,45  letter-of-credit  rights,46  commercial  tort  claims,47 
intellectual property,48 and other types of intangibles.  Modern 
secured transactions law has recognized the rising importance of 
 
U.C.C. § 9-102(12) (2010) (defining “collateral”). 
  39 See LEGISLATIVE GUIDE, supra note 8, Introduction, at 13 (defining “tangible 
asset”).  Article 9 of the UCC also includes “farm products” as a subset of tangible assets 
(goods).  See U.C.C. § 9-102(34) (2010). 
  40 U.C.C. § 9-102(41) (2010).  The Legislative Guide uses the term “attachment to 
immovable  property”  to  denote  fixtures.    See  LEGISLATIVE  GUIDE,  supra  note  8, 
Introduction, at 7  (“‘Attachment to immovable property’ means a tangible asset that is 
so physically attached to immovable property that, despite the fact that it has not lost its

intangible  assets  in  secured  financing  in  recent  years49  and 
provides specific rules accommodating these new assets. 
Modern  secured  transactions  law  also  emphasizes  the 
significance of proceeds as collateral.  By recognizing proceeds, 
the law allows the secured party to maintain its security interest 
and priority regardless of whether the original collateral is in the 
hands of the debtor or has been transferred to other third parties.50  
Additionally, commercial transactions are facilitated because the 
collateral is allowed to flow freely in the stream of commerce.  In 
modern secured transactions law, the term “proceeds” has a very 
broad meaning.51  
By permitting a vast range of property to be used as collateral, 
modern secured transactions law enables debtors to maximize the 
value of both traditional and newly recognized property, rights, 
and  interests  to  obtain  credit.    To  further  facilitate  secured 
financing, modern secured transactions law recommends minimal 
requirements for the creation and attachment of security interests.  
For a security interest to “attach” to the collateral (to be effective 
against  the  debtor),  the  UNCITRAL  Legislative  Guide 
recommends that a security agreement between the debtor and the 
secured party be executed with a description of the collateral that 
reasonably identifies the collateral and that the debtor has rights in 
the collateral or the power to transfer rights in the collateral.52  The 
security  agreement  can  be  in  writing,  or  it  can  be  oral  if 
accompanied by the secured party’s possession of the collateral.53  
 
  49 See LEGISLATIVE GUIDE, supra note 8, ¶ 78, at 49 (“In view of the dramatic 
increase in the economic importance of intangible assets in recent years, there is a 
growing demand to use these rights as security for credit.”). 
  50 See LEGISLATIVE GUIDE, supra note 8, ¶ 74, at 84 (discussing the rationale for 
recognizing security interests in proceeds). 
  51 Proceeds constitute “whatever is received in respect of encumbered assets, 
including what is received as a result of sale or other disposition or collection, lease or 
license of an encumbered asset, proceeds of proceeds, natural and civil fruits or revenues, 
dividends, distribution, insurance proceeds and claims arising from the defects in, 
damage  to  or  loss  of  an  encumbered  asset.”  LEGISLATIVE  GUIDE,  supra  note  8,

  52 See LEGISLATIVE GUIDE, supra note 8, Recommendations 13–14, at 97–98; see 
also  U.C.C.  §  9-203(b)  (2010)  (listing  the  U.C.C.  requirements  regarding  the 
enforceability of security interests). 
  53 LEGISLATIVE GUIDE, supra note 8, Recommendation 15, at 98; see also U.C.C. § 
9-203(b)(3)(A)–(B)  (2010)  (containing  the  U.C.C.  writing  requirement  for  secured 
transactions). 12  N.C. J. INT'L L. & COM. REG.  Vol. XL 
It is important that the requirements for attachment of a security 
interest be distinct from the requirements for perfection of the 
security  interest.54    Perfection  requires  attachment  plus  an 
additional act such as filing, taking possession, or taking control of 
the  collateral.55    This  distinction  encourages  the  creation  of 
security interests because it respects the parties’ autonomy and 
freedom of contract.56  With a security agreement satisfying the 
attachment  requirements,  the  security  interest  can  be  enforced 
against the debtor without further formalities.57  Another notable 
feature of modern secured transactions law is that the debtor is not 
required to own the collateral and is only required to have rights in 
the collateral or the power to transfer rights in the collateral.58  A 
debtor’s “limited rights in collateral, short of full ownership, are 
sufficient for a security interest to attach.”59 
Regarding perfection of a security interest, modern secured 
transactions law provides different methods of perfection that take 
into  account  the  financing  practice  in  each  industry  and  the 
specific features of new kinds of intangible property, including: 
perfection by taking possession, perfection by filing (registration), 
perfection by control, automatic perfection upon attachment, and 
perfection by notation on certificate of title.60  The purpose of 
perfection is to put all third parties on notice and assist them in 
making an informed decision before advancing credit or engaging 
in  other  transactions  involving  the  collateral.61    Moreover, 
perfection  serves  as  the  basis  to  determine  priority  between  a 
security interest and a competing interest.62  Therefore, perfection 
enhances  the  transparency  and  predictability  of  secured

transactions.63  Although filing is the most common way to perfect 
a security interest, it is not the only way, and in some cases, not 
the optimal way for certain kinds of collateral.  For example, the 
secured party can directly take possession of tangible collateral as 
a way to give notice to the outside world of its security interest and 
to assert priority, or possession can be achieved by having a third 
party hold the collateral for the benefit of the secured party with 
proper authentication.64  For intangible property that does not exist 
in a physical form, such as account receivables and intellectual 
property, filing is the only way to perfect the security interest.  For 
certain kinds of collateral such as securities, deposit accounts, or 
letter-of-credit rights, control is the optimal way to perfect the 
security interest according to industry practices.65  Also, in some 
instances,  perfection  can  occur  automatically  upon  attachment 
without  any  additional  steps,  such  as  perfection  of  a  security 
interest in proceeds66 or perfection of a purchase-money security 
interest in consumer goods.67 
Elaborate rules for property collateral and perfection set the 
stage for a clear, transparent, and comprehensive set of priority

rules, which are imperative to enhance the availability of secured 
credit  because  they  ensure  predictability  for  a  secured  party.68  
Modern secured transactions law takes into account every potential 
competing interest in all sorts of collateral and all types of secured 
transactions.  Apart from the basic “first in time to file or perfect” 
rule,69 the law contemplates various scenarios of priority conflicts 
between the secured party and a lien creditor (such as a judgment 
lien creditor, a tax lienholder, or a bankruptcy trustee),70 between 
the secured party and a purchase-money secured party,71 between 
the  secured  party  and  different  kinds  of  buyers,  transferees, 
lessees, and licensees of the collateral,72 between the secured party 
and the persons providing services with respect to the collateral, 
etc.73  Furthermore, modern secured transactions law designs asset-
specific  priority  rules  for  after-acquired  property,  fixtures, 
negotiable instruments, negotiable documents, deposit accounts, 
letter-of-credit rights, and so forth.74 
The two fundamental concepts in the context of determining 
priority,  “purchase-money  security  interest”  and  “buyer  in 
ordinary  course  of  business,”  are  well-developed  in  modern 
secured transactions law as exceptions to the general “first to file 
or perfect” rule.75  A purchase-money security interest (“PMSI”) is

created where the secured party extends credit to enable the debtor 
to  purchase  the  collateral  or  acquire  rights  in  the  collateral.76  
Modern secured transactions law gives priority to a secured party 
who has a purchase-money security interest, even if the PMSI 
comes later than a pre-existing perfected security interest77 in order 
to  encourage  financing  for  the  acquisition  of  property,  which 
stimulates consumption, production, and commerce, and increases 
the  ability  of  the  debtor  to  pay  off  the  debts  owed  to  other 
creditors.78 
Modern secured transactions law also favors a buyer in the 
ordinary course of business79 by allowing such buyer to take free 
of a security interest created by the buyer’s seller, even if the 
security interest is perfected and the buyer knows of its existence.80  
This rule is crucial to ensure the free flow of goods in commerce; 
meanwhile, the secured party is still protected because its security 
interest automatically attaches to the proceeds generated when the 
collateral is sold.81 
With  respect  to  remedies,  modern  secured  transactions  law 
highly  encourages  secured  financing  by  providing  a 
comprehensive set of rules allowing a secured party to efficiently 
enforce its security interest without abusing its rights.82  The law 
recognizes that a secured party has cumulative rights upon default, 
meaning  that  when  the  debtor  defaults,  the  secured  party  may

reduce  a  claim  to  judgment,  foreclose  on  the  collateral,  or 
otherwise enforce the claim or security interest by any available 
judicial procedure.83  Upon default, the secured party can take 
possession of the collateral by judicial process or by exercising 
self-help  (extra-judicial  repossession)  “without  breach  of  the 
peace.”84  The law gives a secured party a wide range of discretion 
in disposition of the collateral, but requires the secured party to 
comply  with  certain  requirements  such  as  providing  notice  of 
disposition,85 following the “commercially reasonable” standard,86 
and  distributing  the  proceeds  in  certain  order.87    Instead  of 
disposition, the secured party can exercise “strict foreclosure” by 
accepting  the  collateral  in  full  or  partial  satisfaction  of  the 
obligation.88  Strict foreclosure is a less expensive and quicker way 
to enforce a security interest.89  To prevent abuses, the law sets 
forth  specific  requirements  that  the  secured  party  must  follow 
when exercising strict foreclosure.90  Moreover, the debtor can

III.  The Desire For A Comprehensive Civil Code In The 
21st Century 
As other civil law countries have done,94 Vietnam celebrated 
the creation of the Civil Code as “central pieces of legislation”95 in 
Vietnam’s legal reform. It was fashioned in connection with the 
national efforts of moving the country towards a market-based 
economy.96  The Civil Code is Vietnam’s proud achievement of 
 
also U.C.C. § 9-620 (2010) (stipulating that in order to exercise strict foreclosure, the 
secured party must send a written proposal to the debtor, other secured parties, and any 
persons with rights in the collateral; the debtor must consent to the proposal in writing 
within certain number of days after the proposal is sent, or the secured party does not 
receive a written objection from the debtor or any person entitled to receive the 
proposal).

Vietnam, a small country comprising the area of New Mexico99 
and the fifteenth most populous nation in the world,100 looked to 
ancient Roman law for guidance in creating its Civil Code.101  It is 
perhaps unsurprising that Vietnam paid deference to Roman law, 
as  today’s  Vietnamese  law  students,  lawyers,  judges,  and 
government  officials  all  learn  to  appreciate  the  Corpus  Juris 
Civilis,102 Rome’s famous ancient civil code. The Corpus Juris 
Civilis103 is a codification of Roman law in 529-534 AD that later 
formed the foundation of civil law legal systems, including the 
Napoleonic Code.104  Though Vietnam’s legal system is new, as 
 
  97 See id. (“The Civil Code is the result of thirteen years of work and is the first 
code  to  be  promulgated  by  Vietnam  since  Ho  Chi  Minh  declared  the  country’s 
independence in September 1945.”).

its “civil law legal system” roots.105  The French brought the “civil 
law  legal  system”  roots  to  Vietnam  when  they  colonized  the 
country.106  Instead of ridding itself of French influence, Vietnam 
embraced  the  “civil  law  legal  system”  tradition.107    Moreover, 
Vietnam closely followed another civil law country, Japan,108 in 
drafting its Civil Code109 despite knowing that the Japanese legal 
system “is deeply flawed.”110 
Thus embracing the civil law legal system, Vietnam presented 
to its people and to the world a Civil Code that embodied a Roman 
law approach.111  The Civil Code is the equivalent of one-stop 
 
“[s]till the basis for most western civil law, the Corpus Juris was classical antiquity’s 
greatest attempt to create a comprehensive system of written law designed to govern all 
human relationships.”); see also M. Read Moore, Tax and Estate Planning Issues for 
U.S. Clients Who Own Foreign Property, SU036 ALI-CLE 395, II(A)(3)(a) (2013) (“The 
civil law system derives from Roman law and the Corpus Juris Civilis of the Emperor 
Justinian. Most of the civil law countries have taken the path of enacting codes of law 
that reflect general legal principles.”); S. Colin G. Petry, The Regulation of Common

  111 The Vietnam Civil Code, a body of laws, resembles what Roman Emperor 
Flavius Petrus Sabgatius Justinianus (Justinian) (483–565), had done: “compil[ing] all 
Roman law into one coherent body, the Corpus Juris Civilis . . . .” Erik J. Krueger, God

shopping for all laws that have significant impact upon society.  
Indeed, the Civil Code ambitiously provides and controls “legal 
status,  legal  standards  for  the  conduct  of  individuals,  legal 
persons,”112 as well as their “rights and obligations of subjects 
regarding personal identities and property in civil, marriage and 
family, business, trade, [and] labor relations (hereinafter referred 
collectively to as civil relations).”113  It sets forth “the tasks of 
protecting  legitimate  rights  and  interests  of  individuals  and 
organizations, State interests and public interests” for the purposes 
of  “ensuring  legal  equality  and  safety  in  civil  relations, 
contributing to the creation of conditions for meeting the material 
and spiritual demands of people, and for the promotion of socio-
economic  development.”114    Its  massive  scope  places  its 
importance in renewing the entire Vietnam legal system.  As seen 
in its preamble, the Civil Code “holds an important position in the 
legal system of the country, creates a legal basis for the purpose of 
freeing up all production capabilities, promoting democracy and 
ensuring social equality  and  human  civil  rights.”115    The  Civil 
Code is viewed internally by the Vietnamese as “just slightly less 
important ‘than the Constitution.’”116 
A  closer  look  at  the  Civil  Code  reveals  777  articles.117  
Together, the articles encompass a vast and comprehensive body 
of laws.  For example, the Civil Code covers laws relating to civil 
obligations,  civil  legal  capacity,  personal  rights,  guardianship, 
death,  missing  persons,  legal  persons,  family  households, 
cooperative  groups,  contract  transactions,  representations,  time

cultural characteristics developed during the long history of building and protecting the 
Fatherland Vietnam, and to creating a multi-sector commodity economy operating in the

promulgated at the same time with all 777 articles linked together.  
It is simply unfathomable to design a single code with that broad 
and  daunting  of  a  scope  at  the  beginning  of  the  twenty-first 
century. 
There is no rational basis today for such legislative drafting of 
a  massive  Civil  Code.119    Each  separate  area  of  law,  such  as 
property  or  torts,  is  itself  very  complex  as  new  transactions 
relating to property and torts occur daily.  In some instances, an 
off-shoot from an existing area of law can be developed into an 
entirely new area of law; for example, trademark infringement and 
unfair competition law originated in torts.  Each separate area of 
law  needs  to  grow  and  change  as  it  continues  to  codify  new 
relations and transactions dictated by daily life and commerce.  
Chaining  massive  areas  of  laws  together  restricts  their 
development and flexibility and means that they all stand still or 
all  move  together  at  the  same  time.    Thus,  amending  each 
individual area of law will require unlocking the chain that binds 
them together in the first place.

IV. The Placement Of Secured Transactions Law Within 
The Civil Code 
Vietnam views secured transactions as “civil” in nature.  The 
law  related  to  secured  transactions  has  not  escaped  Vietnam’s 
desire to maintain one code for all things civil.  In the 1995 Civil 
Code,  Vietnam  embedded  secured transactions  inside  the  Civil 
Code.120  Vietnam envisioned secured transactions merely as “civil 
obligations  and  civil  contracts”121  without  considering  the 
availability of credit and financing in a growing economy. Thus, 
Vietnam failed to grasp the purposes of secured transactions by 
placing secured transactions law buried inside several layers of the 
Civil Code. 
The 1995 Civil Code is divided into seven Parts, each Part is 
subdivided into Sections, and each Section is further divided into 
Articles.122  Deep in Part III under the heading “Civil Obligations 
and Civil Contracts”, secured transactions can be found in Section 
5 under the subheading “Guarantee for the Performance of Civil 
Obligations.”123  Pertinent secured transactions provisions are in 
Articles 329 to 393.124 
Structurally, Part I is devoted to “General Provisions” with 
Articles 1 to 180.125  Part II governs “Property and Ownership” 
within  Articles  180  to  285.126  Part  III  encompasses  “Civil 
Obligations and Civil Contracts,” and occupies Articles 286 to 
393.127  Part IV regulates “Inheritance,” and runs from Article 394 
to 634.128  Part V “Provisions on Transfer of Land Use Right” 
includes Articles 635 to 744.129  Part VI “Intellectual Property 
Rights  and  Technological  Transfers”  contains  Articles  745  to 
825.130    Part  VII  “Civil  Relation  Involving  Foreign  Factors”

After the promulgation of the 1995 Civil Code, Vietnam took 
the next ten years to amend the entire Civil Code.132  A careful 
examination of secured transactions law in the 2005 Civil Code 
reveals the same placement scheme.133  Despite some revisions, the 
structure and content of secured transactions law remains the same 
antiquated, opaque, and incomplete body of law.134 
The placement of secured transactions law inside the Civil 
Code  makes  any  meaningful  and  timely  revisions  to  secured 
transactions law difficult, as proposed revisions must wait for the 
entire  Civil  Code  to  be  revised  simultaneously.135    Moreover, 
placing secured transactions law under the “Civil Obligations and 
Contracts” Part of the Civil Code limits the purposes and scope of 
financing and credit availability.  The drafters failed to understand 
that secured transactions are not just about civil obligations and 
contracts, but also property rights and the use of existing and new 
property, as well as assets and rights to increase the availability of 
credit  and  financing.    Without  a  legal  framework  to  permit 
individuals  and  entities  to  leverage  their  property,  assets,  and 
rights, which would encourage creditors to rely on property, assets, 
and rights for financing, the economy will not be able to grow as 
credit is not available. 
The  failure  to  appreciate  the  purposes  and  importance  of 
secured transactions ultimately led to the creation of an antiquated, 
opaque and incomplete body of secured transactions law.

Civil Code will be “substantial” and “comprehensive”). The scope of amendment 
includes the provisions on secured transactions. See id. at 11 (explaining the revised 
provisions on security rights).  24  N.C. J. INT'L L. & COM. REG.  Vol. XL 
V. The Antiquated Opaque Law 
A.  Antiquated Secured Transactions Law 
Today, Vietnam’s secured transactions law still holds on to the 
antiquated  security  devices  such  as  “mortgage”  and  “pledge” 
which are rooted in ancient Roman law,136 while the world has 
shifted  to  the  unitary  approach.137    The  United  States  was  the 
pioneer in abolishing the distinction among security devices more 
than fifty years ago and adopting a unitary concept of “security 
interest”138 in Article 9 of the UCC. Article 9 later served as a 
model  for  secured  transactions  law  reforms  worldwide  at  both 
national and international levels, most notably, the UNCITRAL 
Legislative Guide on Secured Transactions.139 
Despite the global trend, under Vietnamese law the ancient 
separate security devices still exist.  A “secured transaction” is a 
civil transaction, agreed upon by the parties or provided by law, in 
which a security device stated in the Civil Code is employed.140  
The Civil Code enumerates the following seven security devices: 
pledge,  mortgage,  deposit,  security  collateral,  escrow  account, 
guaranty, and pledge of trust.141  Consequently, any transaction 
which in nature creates a security right but does not fall into one of 
these seven devices, is not recognized as a “secured transaction,” 
such as a financial lease or a sale with retention of title. 
The antiquated approach detailed above is now maintained in 
 
  136 See generally Donald E. Phillipson, Note, Development of Roman Law on Debt 
Security, 20 STAN. L. REV. 1230 (1968) (tracing the history of security devices in ancient 
Roman law). 
  137 See supra Part I, for discussion of the unitary approach (outlining the key 
features of a modern secured transactions system). 
  138 See U.C.C. § 1-201(35) (defining “security interest” as any “interest in personal

International Context, 78 TEX. L. REV. 679, 680 (2000) (stating that Article 9 has served 
as a model for secured credit provisions in both developing and established nations); see 
also LEGISLATIVE GUIDE, supra note 8, ¶ 103, at 56 (acknowledging that the idea of 
creating a single, unified regime of security right in movable assets originated from the 
U.C.C., and later spread to other countries and was followed by the OAS Inter-American 
Model Law on Secured Transactions as well as the EBRD Model Law on Secured 
Transactions).

the civil codes of many civil law countries,142 which Vietnamese 
lawmakers are more familiar with and more willing to accept. 
Vietnamese legal scholars and government officials involved in 
drafting the Civil Code were trained in civil law countries such as 
France,  Germany,  and  Japan,  and  carried  on  the  outdated 
knowledge of secured transactions law.143  As a result, the 200-
year-old French Civil Code144 and the over-100-year-old Japanese 
Civil Code145 were selected as the preferable models for crafting 
the provisions on secured transactions in the Vietnamese Civil 
Code146 based on the faded glory that these codes achieved in the 
19th  century.  Meanwhile,  the  highly  acclaimed  Japanese  Civil 
Code was unable to solve the problem of access to credit even in 
its own country, much less in Vietnam,147 and legislators in Japan 
looked to Article 9 of the UCC for solutions while reforming their 
own law on secured transactions in 2004,148 without the knowledge

Vietnam is now facing similar problems encountered by the 
United States a century ago due to the distinction among security 
devices.149    Distinguishing  one  security  device  from  another 
creates  confusion  and  severely  limits  the  scope  of  secured 
transactions.150  The courts in Vietnam are frequently confused 
between  “mortgages”  and  “guaranty”  when  the  mortgagor  (the 
debtor) is not the obligor,151 but rather a third party who mortgages 
its property to secure the obligation of the obligor.  In those cases, 
the courts have declared the security agreement void and insisted 
that it must be titled “guaranty contract” instead of “mortgage 
contract,”  causing  grievances  and  resentment  from  the  secured 
party.152  On the other hand, some courts have enforced security 
agreements which were mislabeled “pledge contract” instead of 
“mortgage contract” even though the secured party did not take 
possession  of  the  collateral  as  required  in  a  pledge.153    The 
inconsistent treatment of the courts towards misnamed security 
agreements  demonstrates  that  the  distinction  among  security 
 
transactions law).

In this case, the debtor and the bank signed a “pledge contract” in addition to a loan 
agreement whereby the debtor “pledged” the medical devices to be acquired with the 
loan to secure its payment obligation, but the medical devices were not in the bank’s 
possession, and were leased to a hospital by the debtor.  However, the court still enforced 
the security agreement despite the fact that it was mislabeled “pledge contract” instead of 
“mortgage contract.” See id. 2014  TRANSPLANTING SECURED TRANSACTION LAW  27 
devices  based  on  the  name  of  the  transaction  is  unnecessary, 
confusing, ill-suited,  and contrary to the financing practice.  After 
all, the secured party does not care how the security agreement is 
entitled, as long as it has a security interest in the debtor’s property 
to  make  sure  that  when  default  occurs,  the  secured  party  can 
foreclose on the property to recover the debt and has priority over 
competing claimants. 
Another consequence of the rigid distinction amongst security 
devices is the exclusion of many transactions from the scope of 
“secured transactions,” such as financial leases and conditional 
sales (sales with retention of title).154  Financial leases are now 
governed by a separate set of rules,155 and in disputes concerning 
the lessee’s default on its payment obligation and foreclosure on 
the leased property, the rights and duties of the lessor (“secured 
party”) and the lessee (“debtor”) are not duly protected because the 
transaction does not fit into any  of the seven security devices 
under the Civil Code.156  Therefore, financial leases are placed 
outside the province of secured transactions law, even though they 
are  recognized  by  specialized  laws  as  a  form  of  advancing 
credits.157  For example, in one financial lease contract dispute, the 
court  held  that  the  leased  property  was  not  “collateral”  under 
secured transactions law, meaning the disposition of the leased

activities based on financial leasing contracts between the lessors and the lessees. The 
lessors commit to buying assets for financial leasing at the request of the lessees and 
hold the ownership over financially leased assets during the lease term. The lessees use 
the leased assets and pay rents therefor during the lease term under the financial leasing 
contracts.”). The Decree does not address the status of a financial lease which bears 
features of a sale with retention of title; for example, the lessee has the option to 
purchase the leased asset at the end of the lease term for a nominal price, or title to the 
leased asset is transferred to the lessee automatically at the end of the lease term. See 
LEGISLATIVE GUIDE, supra note 8, ¶ 26, at 14 and ¶ 96, at 54   (discussing the features of 
financial  leases  that  fall  under  the  scope  of  secured  transactions  covered  by  the

property  did  not  have  to  follow  the  requirements  of  secured 
transactions law.158  In fact, many disputes arising from financial 
leases concerned the disposition of the leased property upon the 
lessee’s default, such as whether the lessor’s failure to give notice 
of  disposition  to  the  lessee  rendered  the  disposition  invalid  or 
discharged the lessee from the lessor’s deficiency claim.159  These 
kinds of disputes are no different than those arising from pledges 
or  mortgages.    In  those  cases,  the  courts  had  to  rule  on  the 
disposition and deficiency issue without any legal grounds except 
the provisions in the lease contract itself, because the courts could 
not  apply  secured  transactions  law  to  financial  leases,  and 
specialized  laws  on  financial  leases  are  incomplete  as  to 
disposition,  notice,  and  distribution  of  the  sale  proceeds.160  
Without a unitary approach to secured transactions, independent 
sets of rules will continue to govern transactions which bear the 
same nature of securing an obligation, causing uncertainty for the 
parties and failing to provide adequate rules to resolve disputes.

In this case, the lessee sued the lessors for wrongfully disposing of the leased property by 
failing to sell the leased property on auction and prayed the court to invalidate the sale of 
the property and return the property to the lessee.  The lessee signed a financial lease 
contract with two leasing companies whereby the lessors provided financing for the 
lessee to acquire a vessel in the form of a lease with monthly lease payments for a seven-
year term.  The lessee had paid 60% of the purchase price before it defaulted on 
payments. The lessors terminated the lease and repossessed the vessel. The lead lessor 
then hired an appraisal company to determine the value of the vessel, but the debtor 
objected to the appraised value, asserting that the appraisal was too low compared to fair 
market value. Despite the debtor’s objection, the lessors sold the vessel to a third party at 
the price equal to the appraised value. In addition to the claim to invalidate the sale, the 
lessee also claimed damages resulting from the lessors’ conversion of the lessee’s oil and 
assets attached to the vessel at the time of repossession. The lessors counterclaimed for 
deficiency. The court ruled in favor of the lessors as to the sale of the vessel and the 
deficiency claim but held for the lessee as to the conversion claim. The court’s reasoning 
was mainly based on the lease contract provisions and the law governing financial leases, 
which does not require the lessors to sell the leased property on auction.  Id.  
  159 See, e.g., Vietinbank Leasing Co., Ltd. v. Hoang Sa Joint Stock Co., Judgment 
No. 13/2012/KDTM-PT, 3, (Hanoi App. Div. of the Sup. People’s Ct. Feb. 8, 2012); 
BIDV  Leasing  Co.,  Ltd  v.  Quynh  Phuong  Trading  Co.,  Ltd.,  Judgment  No. 
2109/2011/KDTM-ST, 9, (Ho Chi Minh City People’s Ct. Dec. 6, 2011) (Viet.) The 
lessor refused to pay for deficiency because it did not receive notice of disposition of the 
leased property, and because the sale price was lower than fair market value.  Id. 
  160 See  Decree  On  Operation  of  Financial  Companies  and  Financial  Leasing 
Companies. 2014  TRANSPLANTING SECURED TRANSACTION LAW  29 
Similarly,  conditional  sales  or  sales  with  retention  of  title, 
without the status of “secured transactions,” pose high risks and 
burdens on the seller, discouraging sales on credit and stifling 
consumption,  production,  and  trade.    The  unpaid  seller  often 
remains an unsecured creditor or has to seek a different source of 
security, usually real property owned by the buyer or a third party.  
This practice hinders secured financing because not many buyers 
have available real estate to secure their payment obligations under 
the sale contracts with their suppliers to acquire inventory or to 
purchase consumer goods.  Due to the scarcity of collateral, the 
buyer often persuades relatives or friends to provide a third-party 
mortgage to the seller.161  For example, in a contract for the sale of 
timber valued at 4.4 billion VND (approximately 200,000 USD) 
between  two  companies,  to  secure  its  payment  obligation,  the 
buyer – instead of using the timber itself as collateral – sought a 
third-party mortgage from two individuals, who later fraudulently 
transferred the mortgaged property to another party.162  The seller 
(secured party) had to bring a lawsuit not only to foreclose on the 
mortgage but also to declare the transfer void.163  All of the costs 
and burdens on the seller could have been avoided if the law 
explicitly  treated  the  unpaid  seller  with  retention  of  title  as  a 
secured  party  with  all  available  remedies  under  secured 
transactions law. 
B.  Opaque, Inconsistent and Contradictory Secured 
Transactions Law 
Vietnam’s secured transactions law is not only antiquated but 
is  also  opaque  and  inconsistent.    The  inconsistency  occurs  at 
multiple levels, within the Civil Code itself and between the Civil 
Code and the regulations implementing the Code, creating a self-
contradictory body of secured transactions law. 
The distinction among seven security devices is obscure and 
confusing due to the lack of a common thread dictating the Civil 
Code provisions on secured transactions. Without considering that 
the fundamental policy of secured transactions law is to encourage 
 
  161 See, e.g., Hanoi Leather Imp.-Exp.& Inv. Joint Stock Co. v. Kim Duong Equip. & 
Material Joint Stock Co., Judgment No. 55/2012/KDTM-ST (Hanoi People’s Ct. May 
30, 2012) (Viet.) (on file with the authors). 
  162 See id. at 2–5. 
  163 Id. 30  N.C. J. INT'L L. & COM. REG.  Vol. XL 
secured  financing  and  increase  the  availability  of  credit,  the 
drafters of the Civil Code embraced devices that do little to further 
such policy, and instead exacerbate the opacity.  For example, a 
transaction in which a potential buyer puts down a small amount 
of “deposit” or “earnest money” to secure its entry into a sale 
contract is not a secured transaction for the purpose of advancing 
credit.164  Similarly, personal security devices such as “guaranty” 
and  “pledge  of  trust”  do  not  play  any  significant  role  in 
encouraging  secured  financing  and  maximizing  the  value  of 
property, because no collateral is involved in a guaranty or pledge 
of trust transaction.165  Additionally, some devices overlap with 
each other; for instance, an “escrow account” is, in practice, no 
different  than  a  “pledge”  because  both  “escrow  account”  and 
“pledge” require the debtor to deliver the collateral to the secured 
party to secure an obligation.166  Therefore, the list of security 
devices in the Civil Code is inadequate, and on the other hand, is 
opaque and redundant.  Moreover, while financial leases and sales 
with retention of title are not recognized as “secured transactions,” 
the law requires that the lessor or the seller with retention of title 
register the financial lease or the sale at a registration office for 
secured  transactions  to  obtain  priority  against  other  secured 
parties.167  Despite this registration requirement, due to the rigid 
separation among security devices, the courts never treat financial 
leases and conditional sales as secured transactions. 
The  law  also  fails  to  make  a  clear  distinction  between 
attachment and perfection and does not specify the requirements 
for attachment. 168  Hence, the parties and the courts still think that 
 
  164 See C. CIV. art. 358 (Viet.) (“Deposit is an act whereby one party transfers a sum 
of money or precious metals, gems or other valuable things . . . to another party for a 
specified time limit to secure the entry into, or the performance of, a civil contract.”). 
  165 See C. CIV. arts. 361–73 (Viet.). 
  166 See C. CIV.  arts. 326, 360 (Viet.) (comparing “pledge” and “escrow account” 
with an escrow account being similar to pledge in that the debtor parts with possession of 
his or her tangible assets (money, commercial paper, precious stones, or gold), and a 
third party (a bank) is in control of such assets for the benefit of the secured party.). 
  167 Decree No. 163/2006/ND-CP On Secured Transactions, (Dec. 29, 2006) (Viet.) 
(amended Feb. 2, 2012 by Decree No. 11/2012/ND-CP Amending and Supplementing 
Several Provisions of Decree No. 163/2006/ND-CP On Secured Transactions), art. 13. 
  168 See C. CIV. art. 122 (Viet.) (implying the following requirements: (1) the secured 
transaction must comply with the requirements for an effective civil transaction under 
Article 122 of the 2005 Civil Code; (2) the collateral must be of the kind that the law 
does not prohibit to be traded; (3) the debtor must have rights in the collateral; (4) there 2014  TRANSPLANTING SECURED TRANSACTION LAW  31 
the purpose of registration (filing) is to make a secured transaction 
effective against the debtor rather than to obtain priority.169  More 
severe  consequences  occur  from  the  vague  attachment 
requirements.    For  example,  a  court  can  arbitrarily  declare  a 
secured transaction void due to the parties’ failure to name the 
correct security device.  As mentioned above, in cases where the 
mortgagor was not the obligor, but a third party, the courts held the 
security  agreement  void  for  being  mislabeled  as  “mortgage 
contract” instead of “guaranty contract.”170  A security agreement 
has also unreasonably been declared void due to the absence of a 
clear provision on whether the debtor must own the collateral or 
only needs to have some right in the collateral, for the secured 
transactions  to  be  enforceable.171    In  another  case,  the  court 
 
must be a security agreement, either oral or written, between the parties; (5) pledge is 
effective only when the collateral is delivered to the pledgee; and (6) certain secured 
transactions are only effective when they meet the formality requirements, such as filing 
or notarization.). 
  169 See,  e.g,.  SeaBank  v.  MBH  Med.  Devices  Joint  Stock  Co.,  Judgment  No. 
59/2012/KDTM-ST (Hanoi People’s Ct. June 18, 2012) (Viet.) (on file with the authors). 
In this case, although the secured party only sought to enforce the security agreement 
against the debtor and there was no priority dispute, the court held that the security 
agreement was enforceable because it was duly executed by the parties and was properly 
registered at the relevant registration office for secured transactions involving movable 
assets.).  Id. 
  170 See Truong Thanh Duc et al., supra note 152. 
  171 See Phuong Nam Joint Stock Commercial Bank v. Doan Minh Ha, Judgment No.  
1234/2012/KDTM-ST (Ho Chi Minh City People’s Ct. Aug. 22, 2012) (Viet.) (on file 
with the authors).  In this case, the bank loaned 42 billion VND (approximately 2 million 
USD) to an individual obligor and the debtor pledged more than 4.65 million shares 
valued at 46.5 billion VND to secure the obligor’s payment obligation.  The debtor 
executed a pledge contract and an agreement to transfer the shares to the bank. One day 
after the execution of such commitment, the debtor’s wife signed a document verifying 
that the shares were owned solely by the debtor.  The chairman of the board of directors 
of the company whose shares were pledged by the debtor also signed a document 
verifying that the debtor owned the shares.  Relying on those documents, the bank 
accepted the shares as collateral and advanced the loan.  The debtor and his wife later got 
divorced, but they had not disposed of their common property.  When the obligor 
defaulted on the loan, the bank attempted to foreclose on the collateral.  The debtor and 
his ex-wife objected, contending that the shares were commonly owned by them at the 
time of attachment, and since the ex-wife had not signed in the pledge contract and the 
share transfer agreement, these contracts should be void.  They also raised another 
argument that the transfer of shares was subject to restrictions under the Law on 
Enterprises and other regulations.  The court ruled in favor of the debtor and his ex-wife. 
Thus, the bank, from a secured creditor, suddenly became an unsecured creditor for a 
total outstanding debt of 63.3 billion VND (3 million USD).  The court also ruled that 32  N.C. J. INT'L L. & COM. REG.  Vol. XL 
dismissed the bank’s claim to recover debt and to foreclose on the 
collateral,  which  comprised  three  pieces  of  construction 
equipment,  because  the  bank  could  not  submit  the  original 
certificates of title of the equipment together with the complaint.172 
The Civil Code contains various provisions restricting the use 
of  property  as  collateral,  but  the  regulations  implementing  the 
Code  provide  to  the  contrary,  causing  internal  inconsistencies 
within secured transactions law.173  For instance, under the Civil 
Code, the debtor must own the property in order for it to serve as 
collateral.174    The  ownership  requirement  in  the  Civil  Code  is 
inconsistent with modern secured transactions law and severely 
limits  the  availability  of  credit.175    The  regulations,  however, 
recognize that the debtor may collateralize property to which the 
debtor  does  not  have  title.176    Another  example  of  the 
inconsistency  is  that  the  Civil  Code  requires  the  value  of  the 
collateral to exceed the total value of secured obligations if the 
collateral  secures  multiple  obligations,177  while  the  regulations 
provide that the value of the collateral may be equal to, less than, 
or greater than, the total value of secured obligations.178  These 
contradictions make it difficult for the parties to determine which 
law  applies:  the  restrictive  Civil  Code,  which  is  the  superior 
authority, or the more liberal regulations. 
 
both the debtor and the bank were at fault to cause the pledge contract and the share 
transfer agreement void; therefore, no party could claim damages against the other party.  
As a result, the debtor can avoid liability and take the collateral away from the secured 
party.  Although the secured party was also at fault when failing to conduct due diligence 
about the collateral, the court ignored the fact that the debtor still had half interest in the 
collateral and that he had engaged in fraudulent conduct by presenting documents 
representing that he had full power to transfer the collateral to the bank.  Id.   
  172 See Techcombank v. Ba Dinh Constr. & Trading Joint Stock Co., Order of 
Dismissal No. 141/2012/QDST-KDTM (Hanoi People’s Ct. Sept. 21, 2012) (Viet.) (on 
file with the authors). 
  173 See C. CIV. arts. 320–22, 324 § 1 (Viet.). 
  174 C. CIV. arts. 320–22 (Viet.). 
  175 See U.C.C. § 9-203 (b)(2)(2010) (requiring only that the debtor have rights in the 
collateral or power to transfer rights in the collateral for the purpose of attachment of the 
security interest).

deferred payment or installment payments and property leased for more than one year 
can be used as collateral). 
  177 C. CIV. art. 324 § 1 (Viet.). 
  178 Decree on Security Transactions art. 5. 2014  TRANSPLANTING SECURED TRANSACTION LAW  33 
Many provisions in the Civil Code exist without a justified 
reason, contradict themselves, and run counter to modern secured 
financing  practices.    For  example,  the  Code  provides  that  the 
mortgagor has the duty to notify the mortgagee of any third party’s 
rights in the mortgaged property; in case of failure to provide such 
notice, the mortgagee has the right to cancel the mortgage contract 
and demand compensation for damages or maintain the contract 
and  accept  the  rights  of  the  third  party  in  the  mortgaged 
property.179  A similar duty is imposed on the pledgor.180 These 
provisions  render  the  provision  on  registration  of  secured 
transactions  meaningless,  because  it  is  the  secured  party’s 
responsibility  to  conduct  due  diligence  and  discover  any  third 
party’s rights in the collateral by searching registration records.181  
Furthermore, under the Code, the mortgagor is not allowed to sell, 
trade,  or  donate  the  mortgage  property  as  a  gift  without  the 
mortgagee’s  consent,  unless  the  mortgaged  property  is 
inventory.182 
VI.  The Incomplete Law: Missing Property Collateral, 
Perfection, Priority and Remedies 
A  voluminous  civil  code  with  an  expansive  scope  cannot 
provide  complete  rules  for  each  area  of  law  that  it  covers.  
Generality is the main feature of any civil code.183  The absence of 
specific rules is inevitable. With respect to secured transactions 
law,  Vietnam’s  Civil  Code  leaves  numerous  gaps  in  property 
collateral, perfection, priority, and remedies. 
A.  Missing Property Collateral 
Vietnam’s secured transactions law lacks a sound classification 
 
  179 C. CIV. art. 348 § 3 (Viet.). 
  180 C. CIV. art. 330 § 2 (Viet.) (“[The pledgor has the duty] to notify the pledgee of 
any third party’s rights in the pledged property, and in case of failure to provide such 
notice, the pledgee has the right to cancel the pledge contract and demand compensation 
for damages or maintain the contract and accept the rights of the third party in the 
pledged property”). 
  181 C. CIV. art. 323 (Viet.) (providing general rules on the effect of registration of 
secured transactions). 
  182 C. CIV. art. 348 § 4 (Viet.). 
  183 See Arthur T. Von Mehren, Some Reflections on Codification and Case Law in 
the Twenty-First Century, 31 U.C. DAVIS L. REV. 659, 668 (1998) (noting that the codes 
in civil law systems typically embrace a “relatively high degree of generalization”). 34  N.C. J. INT'L L. & COM. REG.  Vol. XL 
of collateral and simply sets forth a lengthy yet incomplete list of 
the kinds of property that can serve as collateral.184  The Civil 
Code  enumerates  the  following  kinds  of  collateral:  objects 
(tangible things), monies, valuable papers (such as monies, bonds, 
shares, promissory notes), and property rights (including property 
rights arising from copyrights, industrial property rights, rights to 
plant  varieties,  the  right  to  claim  debts,  the  right  to  receive 
insurance  indemnities  for  secured  objects,  property  rights  to 
capital amounts contributed to enterprises, property rights arising 
from contracts, land use rights, and the right to exploit natural 
resources).185  There is no distinction between consumer goods, 
inventory,  farm  products,  and  equipment.    The  law  does  not

which comprises: 
-Automobiles, motorcycles, other road motor vehicles; railway vehicles; 
-Fishing vessels; in-land water vehicles; 
-Machinery, equipment, raw materials, fuel, materials, consumer goods, other goods, 
precious metals, precious stones; 
-Vietnamese currency, foreign currency; 
-Stocks,  bonds,  promissory  notes,  payment  orders,  certificates  of  deposit,  fund 
certificates (fund stocks), checks, and other valuable papers that have monetary value 
and are allowed to be transacted; 
-Rights deriving from copyright, industrial property right, right to plant variety; rights to 
payment, other rights owned by the securing party deriving from contracts or other legal 
bases, except land use right and right to ownership of residential house; 
-Right to shares or capital contribution in an enterprise or a project; 
-Right to exploit natural resources, and money paid for ground-leveling and space 
clearance used to secure an obligation; 
-Profits; collateral insurance proceeds, or other pecuniary benefit deriving from the 
collateral listed above. 2014  TRANSPLANTING SECURED TRANSACTION LAW  35 
provide definitions for each kind of collateral.186  The absence of 
collateral classification leads to fragmented and inadequate rules 
for perfection and priority. 
Moreover,  many  important  kinds  of  collateral  are  missing, 
such as letter-of-credit rights, chattel papers, and commercial tort 
claims.  Each enumerated category of collateral embraces a narrow 
scope, which does not suffice to contain all sub-categories.  For 
example, with regard to securities, only stocks, bonds, and fund 
certificates are listed, while uncertificated securities and securities 
entitlements are unmentioned.187 The list of intellectual property 
rights does not cover intellectual property licenses and other rights 
arising  from  intellectual  property.188    In  addition,  the  law  is 
completely silent on fixtures and only covers a general category of 
“property attached to land,” which is typically deemed to be a 
subset of “immovable property.”189 
The  rules  governing  “after-acquired  property”  are  also 
incomplete  and  incapable  of  encouraging  the  use  of  revolving 
collateral in secured financing.  Not all property that the debtor 
acquires after the creation of a secured transaction is characterized 
as  after-acquired  property.190    After-acquired  property  only 
includes  the  following  three  types:  (1)  property  acquired  with 
money borrowed from lenders;191 (2) property that is being created 
 
  186 Only  “inventory”  and  “valuable  papers”  are  defined  by  the  law,  but  the 
definitions  are  very  narrow.  See  Decree  on  Security  Transactions  art  3  §§  8–9 
(“Inventory” covers movable property used to trade, sell, lease in the scope of business 
of the debtor.  “Valuable papers” include stocks, bonds, bills of exchange, promissory 
notes,  certificates  of  deposit,  checks,  fund  certificates,  and  other  valuable  papers 
provided by law, which have monetary value and are allowed to be transacted.). 
  187 Cf. U.C.C. § 9-102(a)(49) (2010) (“‘Investment property’ means a security, 
whether certificated or not, security entitlement, securities account, commodity contract, 
or commodity account.”). 
  188 Compare  with  U.C.C.  §  9-102  cmt.  5d  (2002)  (indicating  that  intangible 
collateral  also  includes  “rights  that  arise  under  a  license  of  intellectual  property, 
including the right to exploit the intellectual property without liability for infringement”). 
  189 C. CIV. art. 174 § 1 (Viet.) (indicating “immovable property” comprises houses 
and buildings attached to land, “including properties attached to such houses and 
constructions . . . “) (emphasis added). 
  190 Decree on Security Transactions art. 4 § 2 (defining after-acquired property). 
  191 Generally, a debtor has to specifically identify what he is going to purchase with 
the loan: a car, a piece of equipment, a certain amount of inventory, or a house; 
otherwise, the bank will never extend credit. See, e.g. Judgment No. 59/2012/KDTM-ST 
(Hanoi People’s Ct. June 18, 2012) (identifying after-acquired collateral as a specific 
machine); Judgment No. 19/2012/KDTM-PT (Hanoi App. Div. of the Sup. People’s Ct., 36  N.C. J. INT'L L. & COM. REG.  Vol. XL 
and is unfinished at the time the secured transaction is entered 
into;192 and (3) property that has already come into existence and is 
of the kind that the law requires registration of ownership but is 
not registered until after the secured transaction is entered into.193  
With such a limited scope of “after-acquired property,” the law 
makes it difficult for businesses to use revolving property such as 
inventory and account receivables as collateral because these kinds 
of property are constantly replaced by new inventory and account 
receivables,  and  therefore  do  not  fit  into  any  type  of  “after-
acquired property” provided above. 
Moreover, the concept of “proceeds” virtually does not exist.  
Proceeds are understood merely as the cash collected from the sale 
 
Feb. 14, 2012) (specifying after-acquired collateral as a certain amount of steel). 
  192 This type of after-acquired property usually refers to circumstances wherein the 
debtor borrows money to develop real estate, or to purchase real estate from developers, 
and such real property is still under construction when the parties enter into the secured 
transaction. This type may also cover unfinished equipment, inventory, aircraft, vessels, 
and again, the property must be specified in the security agreement. See Joint Circular 
01/2014/TTLT/NHNN-BXD-BTP-BTNMT Providing Instructions on the Procedures for 
Mortgaging Future-Acquired Houses under the Regulations Specified in the Decree No. 
71/2010/ND-CP  dated  June  23,  2010  of  the Government  Detailing  and  Providing 
Guidance on the Implementation of the Housing Law (issued by the State Bank of 
Vietnam,  Ministry  of  Construction,  Ministry  of  Justice,  and  Ministry  of  Natural 
Resources and Environment, Apr. 25, 2014) [hereinafter Joint Circular 01] art. 3, ¶1 
(defining  “future-acquired  house  pledged  as  collateral”  means  “the  house  that 
organization or individual purchases from the real estate businesses who develop the 
residential property development projects at the period when the home mortgage is 
brought into effect and such a house is under construction as defined in the approved 
design and construction license (if required)…”); see also Thế chấp tài sản hình thành

different types of future-acquired property under Decree on Security Transactions). 
  193 This type refers to property that the debtor already acquires before the security 
agreement is signed, but the procedure to transfer title from the transferor to the debtor, 
“the recordation of ownership” has not been completed. This scenario usually occurs 
when the collateral is real property, or a vehicle that the law requires recordation of 
ownership. See Joint Circular 01, art. 3, ¶1 (“future-acquired house pledged as collateral” 
also includes “a house [that] has been completely built as prescribed in the construction 
laws but has yet to receive the Certificate of land tenure, house and fixture ownership”);

of  the  original  collateral.194    Banks  in  Vietnam,  however,  are 
unaware of proceeds, even in such a narrow meaning, because the 
law  does  not  make  clear  what  constitutes  proceeds  and  how 
proceeds are treated with regard to attachment, perfection, and 
priority.    Therefore,  banks  always  feel  insecure  when  taking 
security interests in inventory and endeavor to guard the inventory 
instead  of  controlling  the  proceeds  generated  from  inventory 
(account receivables).195  Banks usually restrain the debtor from 
selling its inventory, which not only impedes the free flow of 
commerce  but  also  precludes  the  debtor  from  being  able  to 
generate cash and pay off the debts.196  Apparently, banks’ efforts 
to  guard  the  collateral  rarely  succeed,  because  the  debtor 
inevitably  needs  to  resell  his  inventory  and  acquire  new 
inventory.197  The absence of a well-developed set of rules for 
“proceeds”  locks  up  the  collateral  and  opens  the  door  for 
 
  194 Cf. C. CIV. art. 349 § 3 (Viet.) (indicating where the mortgaged inventory is sold, 
the right to demand payment from buyers, proceeds of the sale, or property formed from 
the proceeds of the sale, become the mortgaged property in substitution for the sold 
inventory), with U.C.C. § 9-102(64) (2010) (providing a very broad definition of 
proceeds, which covers: (1) whatever is acquired upon the sale, lease, license, exchange, 
or other disposition of collateral; (2) whatever is collected on, or distributed on account 
of, collateral; (3) rights arising out of collateral (insurance policy); (4) claims arising out 
of the loss, nonconformity, or interference with the use of, defects or infringement of 
rights in, or damage to, the collateral; (5) insurance payable by reason of the loss or 
nonconformity of, defects or infringement of rights in, or damage to, the collateral (to the 
extent of the value of collateral and to the extent payable to the debtor or the secured

  195 See, e.g., Judgment No. 19/2012/KDTM-PT (Hanoi App. Div. of the Sup. 
People’s Ct., Feb. 14, 2012) (Viet.).  In this case, the bank, the debtor, and a bailee 
entered into a bailment agreement whereby the bailee agreed to hold the inventory 
collateral for the benefit of the bank and to release the inventory only upon the bank’s 
written order.  Id. at 2.  Only when the debtor was in default did the bank discover that 
the collateral had already been sold.  Id.  The bank sued the debtor to recover the debts, 
and also sued the bailee for damages, claiming that the bailee released the inventory for 
the debtor to sell without the bank’s permission.  Id.

rules governing proceeds, the secured party always feels insecure when accepting 
revolving collateral such as inventory.  In the above case, the bank, instead of controlling 
the cash flow (account receivables) generated from the inventory, attempted to guard the 
collateral physically, thus restraining the debtor’s flexibility in disposing of its inventory.

circumvention and fraud. 
Considering the aforementioned gaps in the Civil Code, it is 
unsurprising  that  Vietnamese  banks  are  only  willing  to  take 
security  interests  in  hard  assets  such  as  real  estate  and 
equipment.198  Businesses that have already mortgaged their real 
property and equipment cannot obtain additional financing even 
though they have good business plans or promising deals with 
their customers.  This occurs because banks are reluctant to lend 
against  inventory  and  account  receivables.199    For  example,  a 
representative of Saigon Commercial Bank (Sacombank), a large 
commercial bank in Vietnam, disclosed that the amount of loans 
not secured by real property accounts for only six percent of total 
loans advanced by his bank.200  Banks usually accept equipment 
only  as  supplemental  collateral  if  the  value  of  the  primary 
collateral  –  real  estate  –  is  not  sufficient  to  secure  the  entire 
loan.201    An  inventory-based  secured  transaction  is  usually 
structured  as  a  pledge  in  which  the  lender-controlled  field 
warehouse holds a fixed amount of inventory or warehouse title 
documents are delivered to the lender.202  Revolving loans secured 
by inventory and account receivables are very rare, and banks lend 
against account receivables on a single-account basis rather than 
on  multiple  accounts,203  due  to  the  incomplete  rules  governing 
after-acquired property and proceeds.

inventory, farm products, and equipment results in the absence of

specific rules protecting consumer debtors and farmers, as well as 
rules stimulating consumer and agriculture financing.  Neither the 
Civil  Code  nor  the  regulations  specifically  address  secured 
transactions  involving  consumers  and  farmers.  Failing  to 
encourage  financing  for  farmers  and  consumers  in  a  primarily 
agricultural country with a large domestic market of 90 million 
consumers is an unacceptable gap of secured transactions law.  
Unsurprisingly, the consumer financing market in Vietnam is still 
very modest, accounting for only 3.2% of total country loan book 
and 7.8% of nominal GDP, which is “far below the figures of the 
peer countries,” including Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand.204 
B.  Missing Perfection Rules 
While  attempting  to  enhance  transparency  of  secured 
transactions by adopting the registration (filing) mechanism, the 
Civil Code drafters failed to recognize that notice of a security 
right  can  be  achieved  by  different  methods,  depending  on  the 
secured party’s choice and the type of collateral.  The law provides 
that registration (filing) is the only method to make a secured 
transaction effective against third parties.205  No other methods of 
perfection,  such  as  taking  possession,  control,  notation  on 
certificate of title, or automatic perfection, are available in the 
Civil  Code.206    This  significant  gap  also  emanates  from  the 
distinction  between  security  devices  and  the  lack  of  detailed 
collateral  classification.    For  example,  a  pledge,  which  is 
distinguished from other security devices by the delivery of the 
collateral to the secured party, is treated as a separate security 
device rather than a method to give notice and determine priority 
(i.e.  to  perfect  security  interests).207    Moreover,  without  an

  205 See C. CIV. art. 323 § 3 (Viet.) (“Where secured transactions are registered under 
the provisions of law, such secured transactions shall be legally valid for a third party as 
from the time of registration.”); see also Decree on Security Transactions art. 11 (“A 
security transaction shall be legally valid for a third party [] from the time it is 
registered.”). 
  206 See C. CIV. art. 323 § 3 (Viet.); cf. U.C.C. § 9-308 – 9-314 (2010) (setting forth 
different available methods to perfect a security interest: perfection by taking possession, 
perfection by filing, perfection by control, automatic perfection upon attachment, and 
perfection by notation on certificate of title). 
  207 See C. CIV. art. 326 (Viet.) (defining “pledge”). 40  N.C. J. INT'L L. & COM. REG.  Vol. XL 
elaborate classification of collateral, lawmakers do not understand 
that  different  kinds  of  collateral  demand  different  methods  of 
perfection.  Although registration is the most common method of 
perfection, it is not the optimal method with respect to certain 
types of modern property or transactions. 
With regard to possession, the law provides that the secured 
party may actually possess the collateral or authorize a third party 
to possess the collateral.208  However, the law does not articulate 
the requirements for possession by a third party to be effective 
(such as authentication by the third party acknowledging that it 
holds  possession  of  the  collateral  for  the  secured  party’s 
benefit).209  
With respect to control, although the law provides some vague 
provisions addressing possession and control of savings account 
and valuable papers (such as instruments and securities), it does 
not  clarify  the  effect  of  such  possession  or  control  on  the 
effectiveness of the secured transaction against a third party.210 
C.  Missing Priority Rules 
As  a  result  of  incomplete  rules  for  property  collateral  and 
perfection, priority rules in Vietnam’s secured transactions law are 
skeletal  and  incoherent.    There  is  no  separate  set  of  rules 
governing priorities211 apart from one single article of the Civil 
Code entitled “Priority order of payment” providing the general 
rule “first in time to file.”212  Other priority rules are scattered and 
buried  in  various  parts  of  the  Civil  Code  or  the  regulations 
implementing the Civil Code.213 
The Civil Code provides that if the secured transactions are 
registered,  priority  is  determined  based  on  the  order  of 
 
  208 See Decree on Security Transactions art. 16. 
  209 See Decree on Security Transactions art. 17 § 3 (mentioning briefly the rights 
and duties of a third party holding the pledged property); cf. U.C.C. § 9-313(c) (2010) 
(establishing that collateral can be held in possession of a person other than the debtor 
when the third party authenticates a record acknowledging the possession for the benefit 
of the secured party). 
  210 See Decree on Security Transactions art. 19. 
  211 Cf. LEGISLATIVE GUIDE, supra note 8, Recommendations 76–109 at 204–13 
(providing “rules for determining the priority of a security right . . . “); U.C.C. §§ 9-317 
– 9-339 (2010) (constituting a thorough and elaborate set of rules for priority). 
  212 C. CIV. art. 325 (Viet). 
  213 See, e.g., id. at art. 720(2), Decree on Security Transactions art. 13 § 2. 2014  TRANSPLANTING SECURED TRANSACTION LAW  41 
registration.214  The secured party in a registered transaction will 
have  priority  over  the  secured  party  in  an  unregistered 
transaction.215  If all secured transactions are unregistered, priority 
is  determined  based  on  the  order  of  creation  of  such  secured 
transactions.216    These  provisions  oversimplify  the  complex 
priority issue in secured transactions.  By emphasizing only one 
method  of  perfection  (registration)  as  the  basis  to  determine 
priority, these rules ignore the status of the secured party who 
takes possession or has control of the collateral in relation to the 
secured party who registers.  Priority is determined only based on 
the order of registration, regardless of whether the secured party 
takes possession or control of the collateral or not.217 
The law also completely fails to address priority between a 
secured  party  and  a  lien  creditor,218  such  as  a  judgment  lien 
creditor,219 a bankruptcy trustee,220 or a tax lienholder.221

  217 See Circular 05, supra note 185, at art. 2 (stating that registration of secured 
transaction is conducted even when the secured party or a third party takes possession of 
the collateral).  This rule goes against the common sense of possessory security interest, 
because it is absurd that even if a secured party has possession of the collateral, it still 
needs to register the secured transaction to assert priority.  This requirement not only 
places burden on the secured party but also renders possession of collateral meaningless.

  219 In  Vietnam,  civil  judgments  are  enforced  through  a  system  of  Judgment 
Enforcement Agencies.  After levying on the judgment debtor’s property, the Judgment 
Enforcer must register notice of levy on property at the registration office for secured 
transactions.  However, the law does not specify priority between a secured party and a 
judgment creditor where the secured transaction has been registered before the decision 
of levy on property is issued and also does not make clear whether a good faith secured 
party will prevail if the Judgment Enforcer does not provide notice after the decision of 
levy on property has been issued.  See Luật Số: 26/2008/QH12 Thi hành án dân sự [Law

  220 Under  current  bankruptcy  law,  Vietnam  does  not  have  the  concept  of 
“bankruptcy trustee;” instead, the judge and the creditors appoint a group of bankruptcy 
estate administrators. Article 35 of the Bankruptcy Law (2004) provides that: 
Where the judges issue decisions to open the liquidation procedures 42  N.C. J. INT'L L. & COM. REG.  Vol. XL 
Another  significant  gap  in  priority  rules  is  the  incomplete 
treatment of purchase-money security interest (“PMSI”).  The law 
does not embrace a definition of PMSI and fails to recognize the 
importance  of  PMSI  in  stimulating  production,  trade,  and 
consumption.  The law briefly touches on the rights of a seller on 
credit and a financial lessor by providing that such seller or lessor 
can have super-priority over other secured parties.222  This super-
priority rule, however, has a very limited scope: it only covers 
non-consumer transactions, and it does not distinguish between a 
PMSI in equipment and PMSI in inventory.223 
 
for  enterprises  or  cooperatives,  the  debts  secured  with  properties 
mortgaged or pledged before the courts receive the applications for 
opening of bankruptcy procedures shall be prioritized with repayment 
by such properties; if the value of the mortgaged or pledged property is 
not enough for debt repayment, the outstanding debts shall be repaid in 
the  course  of  liquidating  the  properties  of  the  enterprises  or 
cooperatives; if the value of the mortgaged or pledged properties is 
bigger than the debts, the difference shall be added to the value of the 
remaining properties of the enterprises or cooperatives. 
LAW ON BANKRUPTCY art. 35 (2004) (Viet.).  The Bankruptcy Law fails to address 
whether a secured party must have registered the secured transaction to obtain priority in 
a bankruptcy proceeding, and the legal consequence of the secured party not registering 
the secured transaction before the petition date.  See id. The new Bankruptcy Law, which 
takes effect on Jan. 1, 2015, contains virtually similar provisions with respect to security 
collateral. See LAW ON BANKRUPTCY art. 53 (2014) (Viet.). 
  221 The law does not specify priority in distribution of the proceeds generated from 
foreclosure of collateral of an enterprise owing tax debts but merely provides a general 
principle: where the tax debtor’s money or other property held by a third party is subject 
to secured transactions or a bankruptcy case, the collection from said money or property 
held by third party shall be conducted in accordance with the law.  LAW ON TAX 
MANAGEMENT art. 100 (Viet.) (2006) If the tax debtor has no other assets, the levying 
agency may levy on the tax debtor’s property currently subject to a pledge or mortgage, 
if the value of said property is higher than the secured obligation.  Id.  The levying 
agency shall notify the pledgee or mortgagee about the levy. See Thông Tư Số:

  222 See Decree on Security Transactions art. 13 § 2.

business registration, and (3) the sale or lease contract is registered at a proper secured 
transactions registration office within fifteen (15) days after the execution of such 2014  TRANSPLANTING SECURED TRANSACTION LAW  43 
Priority  rules  addressing  different  kinds  of  buyers  are  also 
missing.    The  fundamental  concept  of  “buyer  in  the  ordinary 
course of business” does not exist.  The law only implies that the 
buyer or transferee of inventory subject to a mortgage can take the 
inventory free of the mortgage if the mortgagor sells or trades the 
inventory in the course of its business.224  Priorities as between a 
secured party and other kinds of buyers are also absent. 
Due to the lack of specific rules on collateral classification and 
perfection, the priority rules tailored to certain kinds of collateral 
(including fixtures, securities, deposit accounts, and letter-of-credit 
rights) are non-existent. 
D.  Missing Remedies Rules 
Vietnam’s secured transactions law on remedies is superficial, 
posing  major  challenges  to  the  secured  party  in  enforcing  its 
security right.  Only three general provisions of the Civil Code 
address foreclosure on pledged property,225 and these provisions 
also apply to foreclosure on mortgaged property.226  Remedies are 
mainly governed by the regulations implementing the Civil Code, 
but these regulations are also incomplete.227  There are no specific 
provisions addressing “self-help,” “no breach of the peace” duty, 
“commercially  reasonable”  disposition  standard,  procedural 
requirements for strict foreclosure, conditions for the debtor to 
redeem the collateral, conditions for the secured party to claim for 
deficiency after disposition, and remedies for the debtor when the 
secured party violates the rules for enforcement of the security 
interest.228  With incomplete remedies rules, however, Vietnamese 
law creates a burdensome and ineffective mechanism for a secured 
party to foreclose on the collateral when a debtor defaults.

Foreclosure  of  Collateral  (Ministry  of  Justice,  Ministry  of  Natural  Resources  and 
Environment, and State Bank of Vietnam, June 6, 2014) (Viet.). 
  228 See supra Part I, pp. 10–11, for discussion of remedies rules under modern 
secured transactions law. 44  N.C. J. INT'L L. & COM. REG.  Vol. XL 
Under  Vietnamese  law,  when  the  debtor  is  in  default,  the 
secured party has several options to foreclose on the collateral: (1) 
sell the collateral; (2) accept the collateral in satisfaction of the 
debt; (3) receive payment from the account debtor, if the collateral 
is an account; or (4) other methods agreed to by the parties.229  The 
method  of  foreclosure  is  agreed  upon  by  the  debtor  and  the 
secured party, or by the debtor and all of the secured parties who 
have taken security interests in the same collateral prior to default; 
if there is no agreement, the collateral will be sold at auction and 
the proceeds will be distributed among the parties in accordance 
with the law.230  The law is silent on whether the secured party’s 
rights upon default are cumulative, including the rights under both 
judicial and extra-judicial mechanisms. 
Vietnamese law does not allow a secured party to exercise self-
help to repossess the collateral, which causes enormous challenges 
for  the  secured  party.  Before  repossessing  the  collateral,  the 
secured party has to give notice and request to the debtor or the 
party  who  is  in  possession  of  the  collateral  to  turn  over  the 
collateral.231  The notice will set a grace period for the party in 
possession to deliver the collateral.232  If the party in possession 
fails to do so after the grace period expires, the secured party has 
the  right  to  repossess  the  collateral  to  foreclose  or  bring  a 
lawsuit.233  If the secured party chooses not to bring a lawsuit and 
instead  repossesses  the  collateral,  it  must  again  give  notice  of 
repossession in a reasonable time before the repossession takes 
place.234  The notice must state the reason to repossess, time to 
repossess, and rights and duties of the parties in repossession.235  
The burdensome requirements for notice of repossession enable 
the debtor to hide the collateral or otherwise hinder the secured 
party from repossessing. 
The secured party has no right to unilaterally repossess the 
collateral without “breach of the peace.”236  The law requires that

the repossession must occur with the debtor’s presence.237  If the 
party in possession opposes or impedes the repossession, violates 
public security, or otherwise violates the law, the secured party can 
request the local authority and local police to maintain public order 
and facilitate the repossession.238  In reality, the debtor always tries 
to delay the delivery of the collateral or prevent secured parties 
from repossessing the collateral.239  In many cases, the secured 
party has to send numerous requests to turn over the collateral to 
the debtor and may even need to request the police department or 
local  authorities  to  assist  in  repossession,240  which  is  very 
burdensome  and  may  subject  the  repossession  to  the  media’s 
attention, creating unwanted publicity. 
Due  to  the  lack  of  an  effective  self-help  mechanism,  the 
secured party usually has to seek a judicial judgment allowing it to 
repossess and sell the collateral.241  Therefore, disputes concerning 
enforcement of a security interest, repossession, and foreclosure on 
the  collateral  are  very  common.    In  fact,  they  account  for 
approximately  50%  of  total  commercial  cases  handled  by 
Vietnamese courts.242  Although this kind of dispute is usually not 
complicated, the secured parties must bring a lawsuit to obtain a 
judgment so that they can seek the judgment enforcement agency’s 
support in seizure and disposition of the collateral.243  Despite the

straightforward nature of these disputes, the judicial process is 
often  burdensome,  costly,  and  lengthy.    In  many  cases,  the 
collateral disappears before a secured party can obtain a judgment 
to repossess and dispose of the collateral.244  Foreclosure through 
the court system may take two years, assuming that the judgment 
enforcement and sale of the collateral go smoothly.245  Even with a 
valid court judgment, nothing can guarantee that a secured party 
can successfully foreclose on the collateral due to the tremendous 
difficulties in enforcing a judgment.246 
The absence of self-help, though often justified by lawmakers 
to prevent chaos, does not, in reality, ensure orderly repossession 
and foreclosure.  Businesses are always in need of an efficient 
extra-judicial mechanism to quickly foreclose on the collateral and 
collect debts.  The law, while failing to meet this need, opens the 
door  to  unlawful,  unregulated  self-help  and  violent  practice  of 
repossession and debt collection.  A recent survey by the Vietnam 
Chamber  of  Commerce  and  Industry  reveals  that  there  is  an 
increasing  use  of  “unofficial  forces”247  to  collect  debts  in 
Vietnam.248  The judicial avenue costs a creditor an average of 400 
days and 20–30% of the value of the debt, and carries a success 
rate of only 50–60%.  In contrast, collecting a debt via unlawful 
means costs a creditor an average of 15–30 days, requires 40–70% 
of the value of the debt, and yields a higher success rate of 80–
90%.249 
Apart from the non-existence of self-help, Vietnam’s secured 
transactions law lacks many other rules governing remedies.  For 
example,  the  law  requires  the  secured  party  to  give  notice  of 
foreclosure to other secured parties when the debtor is in default250 
 
Agency for Secured Transactions, in Hanoi (Viet.) (June 14, 2012).

The law also does not make clear whether the secured party must 
give notice of disposition to the debtor or whether failure to give 
such notice will affect the right to claim for deficiency.  Therefore, 
in practice, debtors frequently refuse to pay the deficiency after 
disposition of the collateral by contending that they did not receive 
proper notice of disposition.251 
Moreover, because the law does not provide the “commercially 
reasonable” standard, a secured party has to go through a long 
appraisal  process  to  determine  the  sale  price,  and  this  process 
depends significantly on the debtor’s cooperation.252  The secured 
party and the debtor frequently dispute over the fair price of the 
collateral, prolonging the foreclosure process.  For example, in one 
case, it took a financial lessor five years to have its deficiency 
claim  resolved  because  the  lessee  disputed  the  value  of  the 
collateral.253  The lessee rejected the deficiency claim, contending 
that  at  the  time  of  repossession,  the  lessor  and  lessee  already 
examined the property and agreed on the value of the property, and 
that the lessee was not given notice of the sale and did not have a 
chance to participate in the sale.254  The trial court accepted the 
lessee’s argument on the agreed value of the collateral and rejected 
the lessor’s deficiency claim, which the appellate court affirmed.255  
The appellate decision was reviewed by the Supreme People’s 
 
parties, or (2) register the notice of foreclosure at the secured transactions registration 
office.  Decree on Security Transactions art. 61 § 1.  The notice requirement must be 
fulfilled at least seven days before the foreclosure, if the collateral is personal property, 
or at least fifteen days before the foreclosure, if the collateral is real property, except in 
circumstances where the secured party can foreclose immediately as mentioned above.

  251 This  method  is  especially  common  in  financial  lease  disputes.  See,  e.g., 
Judgment No. 304/2013/KDTM-ST (Ho Chi Minh City People’s Ct. Mar. 25, 2013) 
(Viet.) (discussing how the debtor contended that the secured party failed to give proper 
notice of the auction of the collateral); see also, e.g., Judgment No. 13/2012/KDTM-PT 
(Hanoi App. Div. of the Sup. People’s Ct., Feb. 8, 2012) (Viet.); see also, e.g., Judgment 
No. 2109/2011/KDTM-ST (Ho Chi Minh City People’s Ct., Dec. 6. 2011) (Viet.) The 
lessor refused to pay the deficiency because it did not receive notice of disposition of the 
leased property and because the sale price was lower than fair market value. Id. 
  252 See, e.g., Judgment No. 57/2012/KDTM-PT (Hanoi App. Div. of the Sup.

Court and was vacated and remanded to the appellate court.256  The 
second  appellate  panel  held  that  although  the  parties  initially 
agreed  on  the  value  of  the  leased  property,  they  eventually 
disputed the sale price, because during the three month period after 
this agreement was reached, the lessor sent many letters to the 
lessee notifying that the agreed price was too high compared to 
fair market value, and asked the lessee to adjust the sale price, but 
the  lessee  declined.257    The  court  also  noted  that  the  lessor 
subsequently consulted the appraisal center under the Ministry of 
Finance to value the leased property and sold the property at fair 
market value based on this appraisal.258  Therefore, the court held 
that the lessor properly disposed of the collateral and could claim 
deficiency.259   In sum, the lessor had to wait for five years, from 
2007 to 2012, to obtain the final judgment.260  As a consequence of 
ineffective and incomplete remedies rules, financial leasing has 
been considerably decreasing in recent years.261 
The  law  on  foreclosure  also  fails  to  provide  rules  for 
determining damages when the secured party violates its duties 
after default, such as a duty to give notice of disposition or a duty 
to dispose of the collateral in a commercially reasonable manner.  
Disputes  over  the  secured  party’s  violation  of  the  notice 
requirement and its right to claim deficiencies are very common,262

significant decrease in the number of financial lease contracts registered at the secured 
transactions registration offices.  The number of registrations of financial leases and sales 
with retention of title dropped from 3,528 in 2007 to 3,408 in 2008, 2,974 in 2009, 2,441

and the Civil Code does not provide specific rules to resolve these 
disputes. 
The  incomplete  secured  transactions  law  with  respect  to 
property  collateral,  perfection,  priority,  and  remedies  clearly 
hinders secured financing, because it fails to encourage the use of 
all kinds of property rights and assets as collateral and does not 
warrant certainty and adequate remedies for the secured party. 
VII.  Solutions For Transplanting Secured Transactions 
Law 
A.  Quick Fix with Additional Pain: The Decree Attempts 
Vietnam has engaged in a pattern of fixing shortcomings of 
Codes  promulgated  by  the  National  Assembly.  After  the 
promulgation  of  the  Civil  Code  in  1995,  the  Vietnamese 
government or “Chinh Phu” realized that the scope of the then 
secured  transactions  law  was  too  narrow  and  passed  Decree 
165/1999/ND-CP [hereinafter Decree 165] to expand the scope.263  
Prior to Decree 165, the secured transactions law did not allow 
non-possessory  secured  transactions.264    That  meant  only 
transactions where the creditor must either take possession of the 
collateral or have possession of certificates of title in the collateral 
were recognized.  Consequently, financing transactions involving 
inventory and equipment were excluded from the legal framework.  
Individuals and entities were not permitted to leverage their rights 
in these types of property to obtain credit. Decree 165 was passed 
to allow some secured transactions for non-possessory security 
interest in inventory.265  Due to internal conflicts and rigid belief in 
the  absolute  separation  between  all  things  civil  and  all  things 
commercial, Decree 165 was quickly undermined by the creation 
 
because the sale price was lower than fair market value.  Id. 
  263 See  Decree  on  Security  Transactions,  Decree  No.  165/1999/ND-CP  (1999) 
(Viet.). 
  264 See Claude Rohwer, Progress and Problems in Vietnam’s Development of 
Commercial Law, 15 BERKELEY J. INT'L L. 275, 285-86 (1997) (discussing the restrictive 
approach of the 1995 Civil Code to secured transactions before Decree 165 was 
promulgated). 
  265 See generally Decree on Security Transactions, No. 165. Decree 165, however, 
was undermined by the passing of a different decree, Decree No. 178/1999/ND-CP. See 
Decree on Credit Institutions Loan Security, No. 178/1999/ND-CP (1999) (Viet.). 50  N.C. J. INT'L L. & COM. REG.  Vol. XL 
of Decree 178/1999/ND-CP in a matter of months.266 
Likewise,  after  the  Civil  Code  was  amended  in  2005,  the 
Vietnamese  Government  passed  Decree  163/2006/ND-CP 
[hereinafter Decree 163] to incorporate some features of modern 
secured transactions.267  Decree 163, however, cannot fix the roots 
of the secured transactions law problems, because the vastness of 
the problems is beyond its capability.268  Moreover, using Decrees 
to fix secured transactions law buried deep inside the Civil Code 
has  many  shortcomings.    These  Decrees  do  not  address  the 
burdens  and  cost  caused  by  an  antiquated  system  of  multiple 
security  devices.269    These  Decrees  often  conflict  or  contradict 
provisions in the Civil Code.270  These Decrees are unable to fill 
the gaps exposed by the incomplete secured transactions law.271  
These gaps, such as lack of perfection, priority and remedies rules, 
are simply too large for the Decrees to address.  Most importantly, 
these Decrees fail to recognize that new rights and interests based 
on property are being created daily.  Consequently, these Decrees 
do not allow for a secured financing system that leverages new 
types of property effectively. 
B.  Different Placement Within the Civil Code? Moving from 
“Civil Obligations and Civil Contracts” to “Property 
Ownership” Section of the Civil Code 
Another potential solution to address the secured transactions 
law  problem  is  to  move  some  of  the  articles  of  secured 
transactions law from the “Civil Obligations” Part to the “Property 
Ownership” Part of the Civil Code.272  Unfortunately, this solution 
is also laden with concerns. 
First,  this  part  is  still  buried  deep  inside  the  Civil  Code.  
 
  266 See Decree on Credit Institutions Loan Security. 
  267 See Decree on Security Transactions, No. 163. Decree 163 also replaced Decree 
165 and Decree 178. 
  268 See supra Part IV. 
  269 See supra Part III.A. 
  270 See supra Part III.B. 
  271 See supra Part IV. 
  272 This  proposed  solution  is  currently  under  consideration  in  Vietnam.    See  
NATIONAL  REGISTRATION  AGENCY  FOR  SECURED  TRANSACTIONS  OF  VIETNAM 
(“NRAST”), Preliminary Draft of the Amendments to the Provisions on Security Devices 
of the 2005 Civil Code (Mar. 10, 2014) (unpublished). 2014  TRANSPLANTING SECURED TRANSACTION LAW  51 
Revision cannot be made, as it must wait for the entire Civil Code 
to be revised.  Outdated articles imposing restrictions and burdens 
on credit availability cannot be promptly revised to adapt to new 
market demands. 
Second, fragmenting a body of secured transactions law by 
placing  some  articles  under  “Property  Ownership”  and  other 
articles under “Civil Obligations and Civil Contracts” will cause 
confusion to debtors, creditors, and third parties.  No one would 
know where to look for applicable laws and which laws would 
apply. 
Last,  and  most  importantly,  separating  secured  transactions 
laws into two different Parts of the Civil Code would mean the 
secured  transactions  law  is  not  necessary  to  increasing  credit 
availability  for  a  growing  economy.    It  would  mean  that  the 
drafters have no understanding of modern secured transactions law 
in the twenty-first century.  Secured transactions are property and 
contract;  therefore,  the  drafters  should  not  place  some  articles 
under the “Property Ownership” part of the Civil Code and other 
articles under the “Civil Obligations and Civil Contracts” part of 
the Civil Code.  The property used in secured transactions can be 
any  right  or  interest  in  any  type  of  property,  such  as  stock, 
securities, intellectual property, promissory notes, chattel papers, 
letters  of  credit,  bills  of  lading,  air  bills,  accounts,  licenses, 
inventory, equipment, farm products, consumer goods, and general 
intangibles.  The property right or interest used as collateral for 
secured transactions purposes does not require ownership of the 
property, as any right or interest to the extent that the debtor has in 
particular  collateral  is  sufficient.    Contracts  used  in  secured 
transactions are valid irrespective of form, either oral or written. 
They  are  agreements  between  the  parties  to  create  a  security 
interest  in  identified  collateral  to  secured  obligation  or 
performance.  Secured transactions law facilitates and encourages 
the  creation  and  enforcement  of  security  interests  in  property 
rights and interests through the use of contracts. 
On the other hand, continuing to keep secured transactions law 
under “Civil Obligations and Civil Contracts” does not reflect the 
true nature of secured transactions today.  A separate body of law 
apart from the Civil Code is needed in order to fully address the 
credit needs of individuals and businesses. 52  N.C. J. INT'L L. & COM. REG.  Vol. XL 
C.  A Separate Body of Law Apart from the Civil Code 
It  is  time  for  Vietnam  to  consider  releasing  secured 
transactions law from the “Civil Obligations and Civil Contracts” 
Part of the Civil Code.  Adopting a separate body of law apart 
from the Civil Code will allow secured transactions law to grow 
and  reflect  the  changes  in  a  modern  economy.273.    These  new 
transactions in daily commerce can be included in the scope of 
secured transactions.  Revisions to secured transactions law can be 
made  both  promptly  and  deliberately  in  response  to  market 
changes without waiting for the entire body of the Civil Code to be 
revised. 
Developing a separate body of law apart from the Civil Code is 
not without precedent in Vietnam.  Vietnam has already done so 
with  Intellectual  Property  Law.274    Due  to  market  demands, 
Vietnam developed a separate body of intellectual property law 
and moved most of it outside the Civil Code.275  The result was an 
achievement that Vietnam was proud to present to its people and 
the  world:  a  more  complete  and  better  developed  intellectual 
property law that embraces most of the international intellectual 
 
  273 In particular, secured transaction law must be able to recognize new types of 
property rights and interests as collateral in secured financing 
  274 The Civil Code devotes a separate part to intellectual property  rights  and 
technology  transfer. See C. CIV. part VI (Viet.). Historically, these provisions were 
necessary to set basic principles for intellectual property protection in Vietnam before the 
Law on Intellectual Property was enacted. See Christian Schaefer, Vietnam’s Evolving 
Intellectual Property Law, 3 No. 4 ABA SCITECH LAW. 18 (2007) (stating that Part VI of 
the Civil Code provides the basic legal framework for intellectual property rights in 
Vietnam); see also EDWARDS FENNESSY, 3 TRADEMARKS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD § 
175:3 (noting that Part VI of the 1995 Civil Code “sets out the basic principles to be 
followed in new legislation on trademarks, industrial designs, patents, appellations of 
origin and copyrights.”) 
  275 In 2005, the National Assembly passed the Law on Intellectual Property, which 
was the first comprehensive intellectual property legislation in Vietnam and retained 
only  a  few  general  provisions  on  intellectual  property  in  the  Civil  Code  (2005). 
Nevertheless,  the  Civil  Code’s  provisions  on  intellectual  property  quickly  became 
outdated and redundant after the Law on Intellectual Property and its guiding regulations 
were promulgated. See Ministry of Justice, ASSESSMENT OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE 
CIVIL CODE, Report No. 151/BC-BTP at 15, 52 (July 15, 2013) (Viet.) (suggesting that 
the intellectual property provisions be taken out of the Civil Code because civil relations 
involving intellectual property and technology transfer have developed more complex 
and change so rapidly that the Civil Code’s intellectual property provisions will soon 
become obsolete). 2014  TRANSPLANTING SECURED TRANSACTION LAW  53 
property law and best practices.276 
Vietnam can take the same approach with secured transactions 
law as it already did with intellectual property law. The drafters 
should draft a body of law that fully embraces modern secured 
transactions and international best practices, thereby increasing the 
credit available for Vietnam’s growing economy.  The new law 
should move away from the fragmented, multiple security devices 
approach  and  replace  all  devices  with  a  unitary  approach,  as 
embodied in the UNCITRAL Legislative Guide and the United 
States Uniform Commercial Code Article 9.277 
Via  a  thorough  understanding  of  the  purposes  of  modern 
secured  transactions  law,  the  drafters  can  ensure  that  each 
provision and article of secured transactions law be drafted to meet 
the purposes.  For example, the new law should contemplate the 
reality of new types of property rights and interests that could be 
used as collateral in secured financing.  That means the new law 
should be inclusive to all new collateral and have a system of 
identifying  and  classifying  the  collateral.    Consequently,  more 
individuals and businesses could use new types of property rights 
and interests as collateral in financing, and lenders could rely on 
these collateral property rights and interests for lending. 
The new law should address the missing perfection, priority, 
and  remedies  rules.    Without  perfection,  priority,  or  remedies, 
there is no transparency, and no orderly determination of who has 
rights  in  what  collateral.  Furthermore,  there  is  no  systematic 
disposition of said collateral and no systematic recourses for all 
parties in secured transactions. With a complete set of rules for 
perfection, priority, and remedies, the new law can truly encourage 
financing and enhance the availability of credit for individuals and 
businesses. 
Vietnam, with a new separate body of secured transactions law 
apart from the Civil Code, would join other nations in Asia and 
throughout  the  world  in  modernizing  its  financing  system.278  
 
  276 See LAW ON INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY No. 50/2005/QH11 (Viet.) (2005). 
  277 See LEGISLATIVE GUIDE, supra note 8, ¶ 50, at 20; see also U.C.C. § 9-109(a) 
(2010) (indicating the scope of secured transactions law covers all kinds of secured 
transactions, regardless of forms). 
  278 See Gordon Walker & Alma Pekmezovic, Legal Transplanting: International 
Financial Institutions and Secured Transactions Law Reform in South Pacific Island 
Nations, 25 N. Z. L. REV. 560, 560 (2013). 54  N.C. J. INT'L L. & COM. REG.  Vol. XL 
Vietnam would enable individuals and businesses to gain access to 
credit so that new businesses, new jobs, and new economic growth 
can  occur,  allowing  Vietnam  to  fully  integrate  into  the  global 
economy and compete in the global market. 
VIII. Conclusion 
It is time for Vietnam and other emerging economy countries 
to truly encourage the availability of credit for individuals and 
businesses in order to create new jobs, manufacture new products, 
and  expand  commerce.    Countries  with  developing  economies 
must shed the vestiges of the Roman law approach and adopt a 
modern secured transactions law as embodied in UNCITRAL’s 
Legislative Guide and international best practices.
