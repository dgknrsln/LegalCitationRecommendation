REPEAT PLAYERS IN MULTIDISTRICT
LITIGATION: THE SOCIAL NETWORK
Elizabeth Chamblee Burch† & Margaret S. Williams††
As class certification wanes, plaintiffs’ lawyers resolve
hundreds of thousands of individual lawsuits through aggre-
gate settlements in multidistrict litigation. But without class
actions, formal rules are scarce and judges rarely scrutinize
the private agreements that result. Meanwhile, the same prin-
cipal-agent concerns that plagued class-action attorneys lin-
ger. These circumstances are ripe for exploitation: few rules,
little oversight, multi-million dollar common-benefit fees, and a
push for settlement can tempt a cadre of repeat players to fill
in the gaps in ways that further their own self-interest.
Although multidistrict litigation now comprises 36% of the
pending federal civil caseload, legal scholars have offered lit-
tle sustained theoretical or empirical analysis as to how re-
peat players’ enforcement efforts shape litigation or claims
resolution. We wade into this increasingly controversial terri-
tory to offer the first comprehensive empirical investigation of
private attorneys’ efforts in multidistrict leadership on both the
plaintiff and defense side. We found that transferee judges
regularly appoint the same lead attorneys.
To then uncover what the naked eye cannot see, we em-
ployed a social-network analysis to reveal repeat actors’ con-
nections to one another. No matter what measure of centrality
we used, a key group of attorneys maintained their elite posi-
tion within the network. This matters considerably, for lead
lawyers  control  the  proceeding  and  negotiate  settlements.
They can bargain for what may matter to them most: defend-
ants want to end lawsuits, and plaintiffs’ lawyers want to

way.
By identifying settlement provisions that one might argue
principally benefit the repeat players, we examined the pub-
licly available nonclass settlements these elite lawyers de-
signed. Over a twenty-two-year span, we were unable to find
any deal that did not feature at least one closure provision for
defendants, and likewise found that nearly all settlements
contained some provision that increased lead plaintiffs’ law-
yers’ common-benefit fees. Bargaining for attorneys’ fees with
one’s opponent is a stark departure from traditional contin-
gent-fee principles, which are designed to tie lawyers’ fees to
their clients’ outcome. Based on the evidence available to us,
we found reason to be concerned that when repeat players
influence the practices and norms that govern multidistrict
proceedings—when they “play for rules,” so to speak—the
rules they develop may principally benefit them at the expense
of one-shot plaintiffs.

INTRODUCTION
Time and again judges appoint the same plaintiffs’ attor-
neys to lead large multidistrict litigations, then compensate
them handsomely for doing so. But identifying repetitive play
is merely the tip of the iceberg, for what lies beneath repeat
plaintiff and defense attorneys’ formal interactions has critical
implications for the development of law and the fulfillment of
fundamental procedural and tort goals such as fairness, effi-
ciency, compensation, and deterrence. When repeat players
interact over time, their past and present connections can im-
pact norm development and entrenchment. Social architecture
may thus affect how actors perceive ethically grey areas in
structuring aggregate settlements, whether they privilege self-
interest over clients’ interests, and how they approach regula-
tory ambiguities.
Because hard-and-fast formal rules are scarce when mul-
tidistrict litigation is not certified as a class action, transferee
judges tend to seek guidance from predecessors, peers, and
lawyers who have litigated other multidistrict proceedings.1
Even though multidistricting aims to avoid duplicative pretrial
efforts, most cases settle.2 So, the small cadre of repeat players

and the procedural norms they develop are integral to resolving
the cases.
The prevalence of norms over formal, legal precedent af-
fords repeat players a critical opportunity. As they act strategi-
cally to maximize gains over a series of cases, and play for
“rules,” the shorthand term for standardized practices that will
tip the scales in their favor in future cases, those rules may well
stick. When layered atop “bet-the-company” litigation, multi-
million-dollar attorneys’ fees, and significant media attention,
the full picture for potential abuse and influence begins to
emerge. Multidistrict cases like those against Volkswagen over
its emission-defeat device3 and General Motors over its igni-
tion-switch defect4 have increased in both prominence and
quantity; they have risen from 16% of the federal courts’ civil
caseload in 2002 to 36% in 2014.5 Excluding social security
and prisoner cases escalates that number to 45.6%.6 Conse-
quently,  through  publicity,  replication,  and  proportion,  key
players’ influence and rules can impact the entire civil justice
system.7
High stakes, rising filings, private settlements, and signifi-
cant attorneys’ fees—sometimes more than $350 million8 in
common-benefit fees alone—have spurred heated debate. Mul-
tidistrict litigation’s champions herald its quiet efficiency and
ability to benefit claimants and attorneys through uniform de-
cisions and resolutions.9 But critics suggest that it can lead to
“lawless  administration  of  aggregate  claims”  and  “black
holes.”10

The lead attorneys who run these litigations must act as
fiduciaries to all plaintiffs, yet critics claim that those lawyers
have engaged in self-enriching acts: by offering lead lawyers’
“‘red-carpet treatment on fees’ in return for favorable terms
elsewhere,” defendants can take advantage of lead attorneys’
control over settlement negotiations to strike deals that benefit
the leaders and the defendant, but not the claimants.11 Moreo-
ver, because transferee judges handpick lead attorneys and
control their financial remuneration through fee transfers from
non-lead attorneys, critics contend that “obedience is the pru-
dent course for non-lead lawyers . . . .”12 Critics likewise note
that, as “veterans,” leaders “have developed an arsenal of strat-
egies to corral, convince, and coerce other lawyers to come
together  for  purposes  of  organizing  and  settling  cases  en
masse.”13 Yet, repeat players explain that it is only through
their extensive experience and financial means that they can
“go toe to toe” with big defense firms.14
Despite this burgeoning battle over multidistrict proceed-
ings and the ramifications of repeat play, relatively little empiri-
cal research exists. This Article begins to fill that gap not just
by collecting data or investigating the centrality of repeat plain-
tiff and defense attorneys, but also by analyzing the results
they obtain on behalf of themselves and their clients. Part I
launches this inquiry with a look into the circumstances be-
hind multidistrict litigation’s ascent and its absence of formal
rules. When formal rules are scarce, socially constructed rules
and norms impact legal outcomes on a broad scale. Accord-
ingly, this Part theorizes the ways in which current practices,
including judicial methods for selecting lead lawyers, create
fertile conditions for repeat play and norm development. It
likewise evaluates the costs and benefits of appointing repeat
players, and thus rounds out the usual efficiency maxim that
typically justifies centralizing cases.15

aggregate claims.”).

1450 CORNELL LAW REVIEW [Vol.102:1445
By focusing on the institutional players who routinely—
and somewhat administratively—negotiate and settle similar
claims, this Article then adds three missing ingredients to the
empirical  and  theoretical  literature  on  aggregate  litigation.
First, Part II introduces an affiliation network analysis (a scien-
tific approach to understanding how agents in a complex sys-
tem interact)16 to visualize the connections among plaintiffs’
attorneys and between lead plaintiffs’ and defense attorneys.
To do this, we built an original dataset out of all the judicially
selected lead lawyers in all product liability and sales practice
proceedings pending on the multidistrict litigation docket as of
May  2013—seventy-three  total  proceedings.  The  Judicial
Panel on Multidistrict Litigation (the Panel) centralized those
proceedings over a twenty-two-year span and collectively they
include over 312,500 actions.
Using that data for the social-network analysis, Part II cap-
tures the interplay between lead plaintiff and defense attor-
neys. When many agents interact—judges, multiple attorneys,
and defendants, for instance—game theory’s traditional ana-
lytic focus on bilateral interactions can break down.17 Network
analysis, however, provides us with a tool for mapping the com-
plex connections between many people (lead attorneys) and
events (multidistrict proceedings), allows us to identify critical
actors and proceedings, and helps us to theorize more accu-
rately about how multidistricting promotes efficiency and re-
solves  cases.18  With  the  network  intact,  we  can  then
hypothesize about what flows through it and what repeat play-
ers’ connectedness might mean to the outcomes they generate.
Central actors might, for example, wield their power to create

Analysis of the American Federal Judiciary, 71 OHIO ST. L.J. 457, 467 (2010).
17 As John Miller and Scott Page point out:
When an agent interacts with only a few other agents, we can usu-
ally trace all of the potential actions and reactions. When an agent
faces an infinity of other agents, we can average out . . . the behavior
of the masses and again find ourselves back in a world that can
easily be traced. It is in between these two extremes—when an
agent interacts with a moderate number of others—that our tradi-
tional analytic tools break down.

and develop rules, influence settlement design, and shape ethi-
cal norms.19
Accordingly,  Part  III  introduces  the  second  ingredient
missing from current scholarship: an empirical analysis of both
the settlements repeat players design and the common-benefit
fee practices used to compensate lead plaintiffs’ lawyers. While
the presence of tightly networked multidistrict-litigation attor-
neys is hardly surprising given our past findings,20 the influ-
ence these key players have on settlements has been largely
ignored. Looking at the attorneys within the network, we con-
firmed that one of the top five most connected repeat players
participated directly in each settled proceeding’s leadership.
We then analyzed the publicly available nonclass settlements
that resulted within our dataset for provisions that may be
more beneficial to counsel than to litigants. This brought to
light the practices and norms that influential actors used to
foster settlement and influence attorneys’ fees outside of certi-
fied class actions.
All of the examined settlements featured at least one provi-
sion that encouraged closure and finality (which benefits the
defendant), and nearly all settlements contained some provi-
sion that increased lead plaintiffs’ lawyers’ common-benefit
fees. When plaintiffs’ lawyers negotiate their fees with the de-
fendant, it raises questions about self-dealing for it severs the
traditional contingent-fee tie between attorneys and their cli-
ents  and  may  compromise  attorneys’  loyalties.21  We  thus
found reason to be concerned that the rules and norms that
repeat players collectively design may benefit them at the ex-
pense of one-shot plaintiffs.
To  be  sure,  there  is  no  viable  means  to  demonstrate
whether repeat play generates “better” or “worse” client out-
comes, for few alternative settlement values are publicly availa-
ble for comparison. And clauses that one might label as self-
dealing or primarily benefitting counsel arise in the class con-
text, too.22 But multidistrict litigation lacks Rule 23’s struc-

tural  assurances  of  fairness—judicial  settlement  approval,
objectors, and appeals. Setting aside bad faith and overt collu-
sion, the fact that the same players appear in the vast majority
of  these  proceedings  and  design  remarkably  similar  settle-
ments that benefit themselves raises new questions about ade-
quate representation and the need for strong case management
in multidistrict litigation.
Consequently, Part IV adds the third missing ingredient to
the theoretical literature on aggregate litigation by exploring
the impact well-connected repeat actors may have on case res-
olutions, ethical norms, and law reform. Take ethics, for exam-
ple: the Model Rules of Professional Conduct were founded on
an individual attorney-client relationship, and although rules
like 1.8(g) (the aggregate settlement rule) have evolved to ad-
dress some concerns in mass representation, doctrinal confu-
sion  over  the  rule’s  application  has  opened  it  up  to
manipulation and social construction by the very parties it
seeks to regulate.23 If the lines between ethical and unethical
behavior blur and pushing boundaries benefits central players
who possess the power and means to sanction others, that
behavior may turn into the accepted norm.24 Accordingly, Part
IV concludes by considering what effect a cohesive network of
repeat actors may have on law reform efforts. Given agents’
historical  adaptability,  regulatory  designers  may  find  more
success with flexible measures that harness competitive forces
already in play than top-down, external reforms.

2017] REPEAT PLAYERS IN MULTIDISTRICT LITIGATION 1453
I
THE RISE OF REPEAT PLAYERS IN MULTIDISTRICT
LITIGATION
Most people experience only the periphery of the legal sys-
tem: requesting marriage licenses, paying traffic violations, ex-
ecuting and probating wills, and sometimes getting divorced.
But, because of their profession or their size, certain people
and  corporations  encounter  the  judicial  system  regularly—
think Walmart or attorneys, for example. Of course, there is a
wide margin between these two ends of the spectrum, and
many people will have casual repeat encounters, falling some-
where in between “one-shotters” and more extensive “repeat
players” as we use the term.25
Spurred by Marc Galanter’s iconic work in the field, aca-
demics have long expected that routine repeat players who en-
counter the legal system time and again will have different
goals than one-shotters. Regulars develop expertise, have a
stable of go-to specialists, cultivate relationships with institu-
tional incumbents like judges and their staff, and enjoy econo-
mies of scale with low start-up costs for any given case.26
Because they encounter the system and its inhabitants fre-
quently,  their  reputation  becomes  important27:  attorneys
might develop reputations as masterful trial lawyers or settle-
ment artists, and corporations might decide to vigorously de-
fend even meritorious cases to signal that they are not easy
targets. Finally, repeat players tend to litigate with more in
mind than just the stakes of a particular lawsuit. They may act
strategically to maximize gains over a series of cases, and play
for “rules,” the short-hand term for standard practices and
norms that will tip the scales in their favor in future cases.28
Much of the literature surrounding repeat players contem-
plates  litigants  as  the  repeat  players—Walmart,  Merck,  or
Johnson & Johnson.29 And it is true that major corporate
defendants are repeat actors in multidistrict litigation. But
they are not the only ones. Many plaintiffs’ and defense attor-

neys are repeat players, too.30 This leaves only one group as
probable one-shotters: the plaintiffs themselves, and perhaps
their individually retained attorney who must cede control to
the judicially appointed lead lawyers—but typically not the lead
lawyers themselves. To avoid having to coordinate with hun-
dreds of attorneys, the judge appoints a small cadre of lawyers
to run the lawsuit and make decisions on the group’s behalf.
Although plaintiffs’ lead lawyers owe fiduciary obligations of
loyalty to the plaintiffs, their judicial appointment insulates
them from being fired or hired through conventional means.31
Corporate defendants, with a large cadre of sophisticated
in-house attorneys, can easily and effectively monitor outside
counsel. But multidistrict-litigation plaintiffs may be doubly
disadvantaged: they are not only one-shotters, they also tend to
be less knowledgeable about the law, which is, after all, why
they hired an attorney.32 Yet, repeat plaintiffs’ lawyers’ finan-
cial interests might be intertwined with one another through
formal joint-venture agreements that spell out funding coali-
tions, informal promises to distribute common-benefit work
and leadership positions to allies, and settlement provisions
that condition the deal on achieving a certain client participa-
tion rate. While lawyers compete with one another for leader-
ship positions and clients, they may also play the long game to
maximize their mutual financial gains.33 So, the concern is
30 Studies have shown, for example, that repeat players have been more
successful in qui tam litigation, that attorneys who regularly appear before the
same appellate court have higher win rates than their opponents, and that judges
are more likely to vote against lawyers who lack experience before their court.

that repeat plaintiffs’ lawyers may be more loyal to each other
or even to defense attorneys than to their own clients.34
These issues do not occur in a vacuum; they take place
against a rich backdrop of legal developments and socially and
judicially constructed norms. Accordingly, this Part explores
the legal context and leadership selection methodology, which
sets the table for understanding how a small group of repeat
players came to exert such a profound influence in aggregate
litigation. It then considers those players’ competitive advan-
tages and the ways in which those advantages might serve or
disserve plaintiffs.
A. The Growth of Multidistrict Litigation and the Lack of
Formal Rules
Repeat players’ influence derives in part from the steady
use of multidistrict litigation to resolve mass harms as class-
certification standards become more stringent. Corporations
operate on an increasingly nationwide and worldwide scale, yet
certifying a nationwide class action where state laws govern
has become less likely due to a series of congressional and
judicial decisions. Congress and the appellate courts have
made certification more onerous by strengthening the com-
monality requirement,35 requiring plaintiffs to prove Rule 23’s
prerequisites by a preponderance of the evidence,36 instructing
judges to delve into a case’s merits when the merits overlap
34 Galanter, supra note 25, at 24 (“The source of business generally counts R
for more than the client, especially where the client is unlikely to return or to send
in other clients. The client is then expendable: he can be exploited to the full.”).
As plaintiff’s attorney Francis Scarpulla noted in supporting the “consensus”
group in the Lithium Ion Batteries litigation, “this group works collegially and
cooperatively with every single person sitting at that defense table. I’ve known
some of them for 45 years, as long as I [sic] been practicing. And I’ve probably
been lead counsel in more cases than anybody in this courtroom . . . .” Lithium Ion
Batteries Transcript, supra note 33, at 40. When the judge then asked the defend- R
ants’ counsel about objections to the proposed plaintiffs’ structure, Jim McGinnis
responded, “I [sic] been practicing here for almost 34 years, have known all of the
people on that side of the courtroom for most of those years, and I can tell you
with the utmost confidence that I’ve never had a problem with any one of them.”

with  class-certification  requirements,37  and  complicating
choice-of-law and manageability questions through federal ju-
risdiction.38 Thus, it is unsurprising that past researchers
found an increasing number of personal-injury and product-
liability cases consolidated through multidistrict litigation, and
a decreasing number of class-certification motions.39
Stricter certification requirements present challenges for
the transferee judges who coordinate and manage multidistrict
cases. While judges were often critiqued for their class-certifi-
cation opinions,40 Rule 23 set forth clear judicial authority to
appoint class counsel, ensure adequate representation, ap-
prove settlements, and award attorneys’ fees. Plus, Rule 23(f)
built in appellate jurisdiction, providing a clear path to error
correction via interlocutory appeal. Time and again, appellate
court judges overturned collusive deals that benefited the at-
torneys, but disserved class members.41
While plenary class certification has waned, claims of cor-
porate wrongdoing have not. When those affected by corporate
misconduct want to sue, plaintiffs’ lawyers aggregate them
through advertising and referrals, using the sheer number of
people they represent to help defray litigation costs. Plaintiffs
and their attorneys—many of whom who excelled in litigating
class actions—are then transferred and coordinated through
multidistrict litigation.42 This provides a forum with the same
high-stakes, but without the overt judicial monitoring and er-
ror-correction built into Rule 23.
This leaves a lot of potential for both innovation and mis-
chief. The lack of clear policing power has left judges scram-

powers.43 Without standardization, ad hoc practices develop,
creating unpredictability and variation in key areas such as
leadership appointments, compensating lead lawyers (in both
practices and percentages), and endorsing or enforcing private
settlements.44 To avoid the coordination problems inherent in
communicating with many plaintiffs’ attorneys, judges appoint
leaders to shepherd the litigation and negotiate settlement.
When those leaders perform work above and beyond what they
would do for their own clients, they should be compensated.
But there is no uniform theoretical basis or metric for doing
so.45 Consequently, judges have tinkered with methodology
and common-benefit percentages, sometimes cutting individ-
ual attorneys’ fees along the way.46
This uncertainty over attorneys’ fees prompts lawyers to
experiment.  Lead  lawyers  are  searching  for—and  finding—
ways to contract around judicial unpredictability via settle-
ment. As we demonstrate, repeat attorneys with the most ex-
perience  are  more  likely  to  be  appointed  to  leadership
positions, and those in leadership design settlements.47 But
questions remain as to whether fee provisions in settlements
benefit the litigants themselves. Without class certification,
aggregate settlements are private deals that do not undergo
Rule 23(e)’s vetting process to ensure that they are “fair, rea-
sonable, and adequate.”48

1458 CORNELL LAW REVIEW [Vol.102:1445
Particular concerns arise in the aggregate settlement con-
text because plaintiffs’ claims and injuries can vary dramati-
cally; multidistrict litigation requires only a common question
of fact, not that common facts predominate as in a Rule 23(b)(3)
class.49 If tried in plaintiffs’ original fora, for a variety of rea-
sons related to jury pool, injury severity, the lack of genetic
predispositions, and even state laws, some plaintiffs would in-
evitably achieve awards much higher than those offered by an
aggregate settlement.50 Thus, because their claims or circum-
stances present unique issues that deviate from the majority,
some plaintiffs may experience suboptimal outcomes.51
It is here that nonclass cases can divege from class actions.
In Rule 23(b)(3) class actions, dissatisfied class members—par-
ticularly those with idiosyncratic or high-value claims—can opt
out.52 Competing attorneys exist to assist and even solicit
them in this endeavor. When judges appoint class counsel and
certify a class, only class counsel stands to gain from the attor-
neys’ fees generated by the settlement. This incentivizes a host
of lawyers who are otherwise ineligible for that fee award to
investigate and cherry pick class members with individually
marketable claims to opt out of the class regime.53
But the conditions in nonclass multidistrict litigation stifle
the competitive check that exists in class actions in two ways.
First, as the following section explains, the overwhelming mes-
sage  sent  by  transferee  judges  is  that  leadership  appoint-
ments—and  the  lucrative  fees  that  accompany  them—are
conditioned  upon  cooperation  and  team  play.54  So,  even
though  plaintiffs’  attorneys  are  known  to  be  an  aggressive
group, their rational and calculated response may be to pub-
licly silence their discord and play the long game by climbing
the leadership ranks. Second, there are more explicit reasons
that even one-shot plaintiffs’ attorneys do not buck. As we
49 Compare 28 U.S.C. §1407(a) (2012) (requiring “civil actions involving one
or more common questions of fact” as a predicate for multidistrict litigation), with
FED. R. CIV. P. 23(b)(3) (requiring such common questions of fact to “predominate
over any questions affecting only individual members” if it is the basis of a class
action (emphasis added)).
50 The scholarly literature is rife with examples that we will not attempt to
replicate here. The interested reader, however, might begin with these two
sources: NEAL FEIGENSON, LEGAL BLAME: HOW JURORS THINK AND TALK ABOUT ACCI-

demonstrate in this Article, settlements themselves can be de-
signed to force them to capitulate by tying their own financial
interests to defendants’ ability to achieve closure.55
B. Why Repeat Players are so Likely in Multidistrict
Litigations
To streamline and organize cases, transferee judges ap-
point a host of what we collectively term “lead lawyers”: lead
counsel, who head the litigation; steering and executive com-
mittees that make key decisions concerning litigation strategy
and settlement;56 liaison counsel, who disseminates informa-
tion to other attorneys, calls meetings, and coordinates with
counsel in related state (and sometimes bankruptcy) actions;
and occasionally separate committee chairs such as discovery
and trial committees.57
Repeat players are especially likely to occupy these leader-
ship positions for three reasons. First, by encouraging private
ordering and consensus, judicial methods for selecting lead
lawyers favor those who have litigated multidistrict litigations
in the past. Previous players know one another, have worked
together before, and are thus well positioned to take the helm.
Second, the judges appointing attorneys for leadership roles
stress  attorneys’  cooperative  tendencies,  which  advantages
lawyers with pre-existing relationships who have a track record
of working well together. Finally, while all civil litigation tends
to result in settlement over trial, the emphasis on settlement
within  multidistrict  proceedings  is  especially  pronounced.
With less than three percent of cases ever returning to their
court of origin and a persistent stigma of “remand-as-failure,”58
transferee judges have a strong desire to settle these cases.
This suggests a need to select attorneys with experience set-
tling complex matters over those who are relatively inexperi-
enced. As discussed below, these three factors create fertile
conditions for repeat play.

1460 CORNELL LAW REVIEW [Vol.102:1445
1. Lead Lawyer Selection Methods
It is often impossible to determine precisely how judges
select leaders. Attorney applications are rarely found on judi-
cial dockets, judges tend not to be explicit about their actual
methodology, and the attorneys’ internal coordination efforts
may ultimately dictate the slate.59 For example, judges may
conduct  an  open  application  process,  but  may  be  given  a
choice between two competing consensus slates or may simply
select the attorney with the most consensus support.
Still, judges typically use one of three methods: consensus
methods, competitive selection, and a hybrid of those options.
First, the consensus method relies on informal attorney net-
works to identify necessary leadership positions and select
their  own  leaders;  the  judge  then  confirms  the  proposed
slate.60 Second, the hybrid process allows temporary, “interim”
lead counsel to apply, nominate liaison counsel and executive
committee  members,  and  appoint  sub-committee  members
while  simultaneously  permitting  an  open  application  pro-
cess.61 As one objector in the General Motors Ignition Switch
litigation noted, however, this process “empowers [temporary
lead counsel] to handpick the majority of the Executive Com-
mittee” and leaves only a few positions “open to a transparent
application process.”62 Third, judges might implement com-
petitive  selection  where  the  court  invites  submissions  and

MANUALFOR COMPLEX LITIGATION (FIRST) §§1.92, 4.53 (1982), with MANUALFOR COM-
PLEX LITIGATION (SECOND) §20.224 (1985). Informal selection methods vary and
may simply be based on a vote of attorneys invited to a particular meeting.

chooses among them. Judges might leave the vetting to special
masters and law clerks, then treat the final selection as a con-
firmation hearing of sorts.63
In these latter two methods, judges sometimes permit com-
peting attorneys to object to proposed nominees. Attorneys
who work together frequently are likely to have superior infor-
mation about one another’s skills and temperament. Thus,
allowing objections can impart valuable vetting information to
judges and special masters. But repeat players may reveal that
information only if solicited privately. When judges require at-
torneys to serve their objections on all counsel,64 or solicit ob-
jections in open court,65 they are unlikely to receive candid
feedback. The conditions are ripe for conformity and informa-
tion cascades: the relevant plaintiffs’ bar is small, lead lawyers
can influence and sometimes directly control one another’s at-
torneys’ fees, lawyers must often rely on each other to form
funding coalitions, and, as explained below, being dubbed “un-
cooperative” may render defectors ineligible for future leader-
ship roles.66
2. Emphasis on Factors that Favor Repeat Players
When judges consider applicants for leadership positions,
they focus on experience, cooperative tendencies, and an abil-
ity to finance the litigation67—factors that favor repeat players.

1462 CORNELL LAW REVIEW [Vol.102:1445
To gauge these criteria, judges often request short four to five
page submissions, and call other judges to ask about disrup-
tive attorneys.68 Even attorneys’ submissions sometimes sug-
gest  a  litany  of  judges  who  can  vouch  for  the  applicant’s
reputation  and  “proven  ability  to  work  well  with  others.”69
When writing about selection criteria, the judge who presided
over the Hurricane Katrina litigation listed “team players” as
“the primary factor in choosing lead counsel, liaison counsel,
or even membership on a steering committee.”70
In the abstract, experience and cooperation seem like posi-
tive attributes. And experience in building the relevant infra-
structure  to  litigate  claims  is  critical.  But  in  reality,
emphasizing cooperation can lead to three negative effects that
may dampen the advantage that experience confers. First, it
may foster a need for attorneys to curry favor with one another
to secure lucrative positions in future leadership hierarchies.
Second, it deters dissent by implicitly labeling it as something
that should not be rewarded. Yet, dissent can be particularly
important during settlement.
The lack of dissent prompts a third concern over adequate
representation.71 Because multidistrict litigation’s authorizing
statute requires that cases share only a single common ques-
tion of fact,72 claimants’ best interests are unlikely to be uni-

form.  And  the  claimants  most  likely  to  be  disserved  by
nonclass multidistrict litigation—and thus most in need of dis-
sent  on  their  behalf—are  those  with  unique  or  high-value
claims. As Professor Richard Nagareda elaborated in the class
context, “[M]embers with high-value claims are the ones most
at risk from the sale of claims en masse by class counsel as
monopolist. The greater the variance in claim value, the more
fervent the effort at variance reduction through the embrace of
a class settlement that dampens the prospect for variance at
the high end of the damage scale . . . .”73 The same logic holds
true  when  multidistrict  proceedings  are  resolved  through
mass—though not class—settlement, as is the case for most
product liability and sales practice proceedings.74 But incen-
tives to dissent are weaker.
Unlike class actions, where the defendant has reason to
raise conflicting interests when battling class certification, the
controlling stakeholders in nonclass multidistrict litigation—
plaintiffs’ lead lawyers, defendants, and their attorneys—have
little economic motive to raise conflicts. Lead lawyers have two
income sources: contingent fees from their own clients and
court ordered “taxes” from plaintiffs (and their individual coun-
sel) who benefit from leaders’ efforts. Attorneys profit from rep-
resenting as many people as possible—not from recognizing
divisive interests. And defendants’ closure hinges not on the
preclusive effect of a class-wide settlement that demands ade-
quate representation, but on convincing claimants to accept a
settlement offer. Consequently, judicial pressure toward coop-
eration and consensus may erode dissent and the adequate
representation that follows from it.
3. Settlement Pressure
As  is  the  case  nationwide,  in  multidistrict  proceedings
there are far more claims than an individual judge can try in
full.75 As the proceedings in our database illustrate, this cre-
ates systemic pressure to settle that is exacerbated by the con-
tinued  control  that  key  stakeholders  can  exert  through
centralization and the transferee judges’ reluctance to remand
perspective of the paternalism model are exacerbated by the extremely loose con-
nection required among the claims.”).

multidistrict litigation as well.

Settlement likewise allows repeat players to expand their power
beyond the federal court’s jurisdiction. As transferee judges
recognize their limited authority to command parallel litigation
in state courts—at least beyond informal coordination—repeat
players may seize the opportunity to benefit from fees in com-
peting state cases through settlement design.79 As lead law-

C. Costs and Benefits of Repeat Play—Why This Matters
As Table 1 illustrates, multidistrict litigations are ripe not
only for repeat players to influence, create, and change the
standard practices—“rules,” for short—that occur within them,
but also to entrench those rules. First, appellate oversight is
rare. Cases often conclude through private settlements that
are not appealable;81 interim rulings, such as those appointing
lead lawyers or creating common-benefit funds, are not dispos-
itive and are reviewable only through an extraordinary writ of
mandamus or subsequent dismissal;82 and, in the unlikely
event of appellate review, courts use the deferential abuse-of-
80 See infra section III.B.2.
81 Some judges have expressly waived parties’ ability to appeal through their
common-benefit fund participation agreement. E.g., In re C.R. Bard, Inc. Pelvic
Repair Sys. Prods. Liab. Litig., No. 2187 (S.D. W. Va. Oct. 4, 2012) (Pretrial Order
No. 54, at 5–6).
82 See Cunningham v. Hamilton Cty., 527 U.S. 198, 207 (1999); Firestone
Tire & Rubber Co. v. Risjord, 449 U.S. 368, 376–78 (1981); Redish & Karaba,

discretion standard.83 Second, because formal, hard-and-fast
rules are scarce, transferee judges tend to look to their prede-
cessors and peers for guidance.84 Without much external scru-
tiny, past practices may become best practices and experienced
repeat players could cite, replicate, and improve upon proce-
dures that benefitted them while discarding those that did not.
Repeat players can shape leadership appointments in at
least three ways. First, the consensus-selection method (and
even methods where the judge formally selects but defers to
private ordering) allows repeat players to proffer a preordained
leadership slate.85 Second, even if the transferee judge em-
ploys a competitive-selection process for key positions like lead
and liaison counsel as well as the steering committee, chosen
leaders can then select attorneys to perform the work or serve
on sub-committees, like a discovery committee. Third, in open-
selection  or  hybrid-selection  methods,  repeat  players  may
vouch for one another’s cooperative abilities, providing a cho-
rus of support—either in writing or in open court—for the unof-
ficial consensus nominees.86
Once appointed, leaders can likewise work to maximize
their common-benefit fees. Because there is no firm doctrinal
ground to guide judges in awarding these fees,87 ample oppor-
tunities exist for lead lawyers to influence their compensation.
First, judges often implement leaders’ proposed common-bene-
fit orders, and defer to leaders’ requests to raise fees during the
proceeding.88  Second,  in  some  multidistrict  proceedings,
judges may create a fee-allocation committee comprised of the
83 E.g., In re Vioxx Prods. Liab. Litig., No. 09-30446, 388 Fed. Appx. 391 (5th
Cir. July 16, 2010) (using the abuse-of-discretion standard in reviewing the alle-
gation that the judge should have recused himself based on his dual roles as
judge and Chief Administrator of the Master Settlement Agreement).
84 For example, the opinions in Zyprexa heavily influenced the oversight of
Guidant and Vioxx. E.g., In re Vioxx Prods. Liab. Litig., No. 1657, 650 F. Supp. 2d
549, 560 (E.D. La. Aug. 3, 2009); In re Vioxx Prods. Liab. Litig., No. 1657, 574 F.
Supp. 2d 606, 611–12 (E.D. La. Aug. 27, 2008); In re Guidant Corp. Implantable
Defibrillators Prods. Liab. Litig., No. 05–1708, 2008 WL 682174, at *17–18 (D.
Minn. Mar. 7, 2008).
85 For example, in the Lithium Ion Batteries Antitrust Litigation, when plain-
tiffs’ attorneys could not reach a complete consensus as to who would represent
the indirect purchasers before the court’s hearing, Dan Becnel noted, “I tried to—
when we came down here to—to have three [lead counsel], make a deal, and—and
Mr. Berman decided not to. So the bulk of us think Mr. Cotchett and the Cabraser
firm are excellent.” Lithium Ion Batteries Transcript, supra note 33, at 51. R

we are glad to work with all three firms.”).

principal lead lawyers.89 This means that at any given time,
lawyers could pressure other attorneys through their influence
over fees in concurrent multidistrict proceedings. Third, repeat
players  may  understand—and  perpetuate—norms  about
which kind of work is most beneficial (and thus most deserving
of enhanced compensation), perform that work themselves,
and delegate less profitable tasks to others.90 Finally, as the
settlement designers, lead lawyers could insert fee provisions
into settlements, negotiate their fees directly with the defen-
dant, and contract around judicial fee orders to tax settling
state-court plaintiffs via master settlement agreements.91
To be sure, repeat play can generate positive effects, too.
First, repeat players capitalize on economies of scale and their
acquired knowledge is imperative. It takes expertise to compre-
hend the science behind injuries, understand the risks of vari-
ous  litigation  strategies,  build  the  infrastructure  that
accompanies a multidistrict proceeding, and manage litigation
effectively.92
Second, repeat actors are intimately familiar with the myr-
iad layers of administrative service providers who work behind
the scenes from claim initiation to resolution, but may renege
on their price structuring and deliverables. These providers
range from client-intake call centers and client-referral services
that promise to deliver client leads through advertising93 to

marketing firms,94 document repositories, and claims adminis-
trators.95 In this way, multidistrict litigation is merely one
facet of a broad network of stakeholders.96 Because there is
little direct judicial oversight and regulation, particularly with
regard to pricing document databases and claims administra-
tion, repeat play incentivizes providers to follow through on
their commitments. Yet, this also creates opportunities for ser-
vice providers to conspire with repeat players in ways that dis-
serve plaintiffs.
Third, when repeat players get involved in a multidistrict
litigation, it signals to other plaintiffs’ lawyers and defendants
that it’s a high-stakes case. Certain firms are known to inten-
sively vet cases with experts long before filing a complaint.
Consequently, their reputation may encourage others to adver-
tise and recruit clients, and prompt cases to settle more quickly
than they otherwise might. Those settlement values may like-
wise reflect repeat players’ knowledge about previous awards,
which helps prevent defendants from using information asym-
metries to their advantage.97
Finally, attorneys who have worked together closely in the
past will know more about one another’s work habits and ex-
pertise than the judge. As lawyers form leadership groups for a
particular case, they might design their team to maximize one
another’s strengths. Moreover, because they work together fre-
quently, repeat players can use social and financial sanctions
to enforce norms and promote efficiency beyond simplistic effi-
ciencies such as avoiding duplicative discovery and pre-trial
motions. For example, it makes sense to ostracize disorganized
attorneys with poor work product, those who are inefficient
time-managers with inflated billable hours, and those who can-
not complete assignments on time. Yet, reciprocal relation-
ships might likewise mean that attorneys who would otherwise

be excluded for their various failings may nevertheless remain
if lead or liaison counsel is indebted to them.98
Given the degree of specialization and success required to
fund firms’ capital contributions in multidistrict litigation, this
segment of the plaintiffs’ bar is relatively small; reciprocal rela-
tionships  form,  and  an  attorney’s  reputation  matters  im-
mensely. Playing the long game may not only allow repeat
players to play for rules and reap the advantages those rules
provide, but also empower those attorneys to influence and
control group dynamics in ways that could impinge on client
representation.99
Accordingly, whether the positive gains outweigh the po-
tential negatives remains to be seen.100 Because repeat players
have so much control with so few external safeguards and so
little incentive to draw attention to deals that may not favor
litigants over lawyers, there is a pressing need to examine both
who repeat players are and the deals they design. Conse-
quently, we turn now to those tasks using a dataset of repeat
players in products-liability and sales-practices multidistrict
litigation.

ship positions, which helps gauge the participation and influ-
ence levels that allow attorneys to control litigation and shape
settlements. After establishing who is in the repeat-player net-
work, we then analyze the publicly available nonclass settle-
ments that these leaders create.
A. Data Description and Sample Selection
To achieve some sense of how prevalent repeat players (in-
dividual attorneys and law firms) are in multidistrict litigation,
we built an original dataset that includes all judicially ap-
pointed lead plaintiff and defense lawyers in all products-liabil-
ity and sales-practices multidistrict litigations pending as of
May 14, 2013. This date allows us to examine an array of
resulting settlements.102 A list of these 73 proceedings appears
in Appendix A1; collectively the proceedings include approxi-
mately 312,555 actions.
If repeat players exist, these proceedings should provide a
representative sample for several reasons. First, products lia-
bility and sales practices constitute well over one-third of all
multidistrict proceedings—the largest segment by far.103 And
looking beyond the simple count of multidistrict proceedings to
the actual number of actions contained in each shows that
products liability comprise up to 92% of all those pending ac-
tions.104 Second, examining pending cases on a certain date
includes data from cases centralized over a twenty-two-year
102 We identified the relevant proceedings using the Panel’s list of pending
multidistrict litigations as of May 14, 2013. Because the Deepwater Horizon Oil
Spill proceeding dealt with issues similar to products liability, such as physical
harm and economic loss, we also included it. One case mentioned on that May
14, 2013 list was excluded because the orders were not electronically available (In
re Methyl Tertiary Butyl Ether (“MTBE”) Prods. Liab. Litig., which began in 2000).
Only interim counsel appointments were available in In re Plavix Marketing, Sales
Practices and Products Liability Litigation and In re Toyota Motor Corp. Hybrid
Brake Marketing, Sales Practices, and Products Liability Litigation. Finally, we
included five separate multidistrict litigations over pelvic-repair systems trans-
ferred to the Southern District of West Virginia. The transferee judge named the
same 62 attorneys as lead lawyers in four of those five cases. Coding those four
litigations as one would reduce the percentage of repeat play: repeat attorneys
would hold 54.9% of all lead-lawyer positions and repeat law firms would occupy
73.2% of the available positions. Because the Panel could have created one large
multidistrict case, but chose not to do so, we treat these five proceedings
separately.

span.105 Third, to the extent possible, we included data from
all orders appointing lead lawyers (plaintiffs’ steering commit-
tees, plaintiffs’ liaison committees, discovery committees, trial
committees, defendant’s lead counsel, etc.), not just lead coun-
sel. While lead counsel has the most power in any proceeding,
the additional steering or executive committee members follow
them closely. Once lead lawyers negotiate a master settlement,
liaison counsel also plays a vital role in marketing the deal to
individual lawyers both inside and outside the multidistrict
proceeding—including those attorneys litigating solely in state
courts. When taken as a whole, this information should give
an accurate sense of the scale of repeat play.
Our data confirmed that repeat players populate most mul-
tidistrict leadership positions. On the plaintiffs’ side, repeat
players (attorneys who held more than one leadership position
within our dataset) held 767 out of 1,221 available leadership
roles, or 62.8%. Fifty attorneys were named as lead lawyers in
five or more multidistrict litigations and those 50 attorneys
occupied 30% of all plaintiff-side leadership positions.106 A full
list of those attorneys appears in Appendix A2, and a partial list
of the top 25 high-level players appears subsequently in Table
3. Repeat play among plaintiffs’ law firms was even more evi-
dent. Again, even though only 40.7% of law firms were repeat
players (i.e., had more than one lawyer from that firm ap-
pointed to a leadership position within the dataset), lawyers
from those 70 firms occupied 78% of all available leadership
positions.107 Seventy law firms had attorneys who were named
to five or more leadership roles, and attorneys from those firms
were appointed to well over half of all lead-lawyer positions.
Put starkly, 16% of the involved law firms held nearly 54% of all
leadership positions. Appendix A3 contains a list of plaintiffs’-
side  repeat-player  law  firms  with  the  greatest  number  of
appearances.
On the defense side, repeat players held 73 of 414 leader-
ship positions, or 17.6%. Of course, defense lawyers are rarely
105 As noted in footnote 102, one older case was excluded because the orders R
were not available electronically, but In re Asbestos Products Liability Litigation,
which began in 1991, is included.
106 This statistic does not count lawyers who occupied multiple leadership
positions within the same multidistrict litigation.
107 Two judges named entire law firms as lead or liaison counsel. Where
possible, only the attorneys from the named law firm who were “to be notified by
the court” on PACER were included in the data. The number of available leader-
ship positions from the law firm perspective was 1,222, and lawyers from firms
named more than once occupied 957 of those leadership positions.\\jciprod01\productn\C\CRN\102-6\CRN602.txt unknown Seq: 28 29-SEP-17 12:56

judicially  appointed  to  leadership  positions;  the  defendant
hires the law firm directly and different partners may spear-
head distinct matters. So, evidence of repeat play by those
attorneys’ law firms was more indicative for defendants: of the
414  available  leadership  positions,  attorneys  from  repeat-
player defense firms occupied 341, or 82.3%, of those leader-
ship roles. The 19 defense firms whose attorneys occupied five
or more leadership positions claimed 41.5% of those roles. A
list of defense-side repeat-player law firms with the greatest
number of appearances appears subsequently in Table 4.
While this Article focuses on nonclass proceedings, infor-
mation on repeat play in class-action settlements occurring
within multidistrict proceedings nevertheless provides some
useful comparisons. Class actions tended to have fewer leader-
ship positions, ranging from 22 at the high end to 4 at the low
end, and averaging 11.5 positions per proceeding, 43.9% of
which were filled with repeat players. By contrast, plaintiffs’
leadership positions in nonclass cases ranged from 62 in the
pelvic-mesh cases (American Medical Systems, Ethicon, Boston
Scientific, and  C.R.  Bard)  at  the  high  end  to  3  positions
(Coloplast and Zimmer Durom Hip Cup) or 1 firm (Mirapex) at
the low end.108 Nonclass multidistrict litigations averaged 21.9
positions per proceeding, 75.2% of which were filled with re-
peat players. Excluding the unusually high number of pelvic-
mesh appointments (in American Medical Systems, Ethicon,
Boston Scientific, and C.R. Bard) lowers the average number of
positions to 15.9, with repeat players occupying 61%. More
detailed information on the level of repeat play by proceeding
appears subsequently in Table 5.
B. The Network Methodology
We used a social network analysis to depict the connec-
tions between lawyers and multidistrict proceedings. Network
analysis has long been used to study relationships between
leaders such as judges and corporate board members.109 Not
only does graphing the network demonstrate if there are inter-
108 The New England Compounding litigation was excluded from these calcu-
lations given its unique bankruptcy status.

ander, Small Worlds Among Interlocking Directors: Network Structure and Distance
in Bipartite Graphs, 10 COMPUTATIONAL & MATHEMATICAL ORG. THEORY 69, 74 (2004).
This work builds on the early contributions of Jacob Moreno, who pioneered
networks analysis’s use in diagramming social relationships between individuals
holding leadership positions. JACOB L. MORENO, WHO SHALL SURVIVE? A NEW AP-
PROACHTOTHE PROBLEMOF HUMAN INTERRELATIONS 86, 153 (1934).\\jciprod01\productn\C\CRN\102-6\CRN602.txt unknown Seq: 29 29-SEP-17 12:56

connections within data (or not), the graphs can highlight the
relative importance of a set of entities to the larger group, such
as  particular  multidistrict  proceedings  or  attorneys  within
those proceedings.110
Accordingly, we built an adjacency matrix and employed a
two-mode (actors and events) projection of a bipartite network,
also known as an affiliation network, to graph the ties between
lawyers judicially appointed to leadership positions (the actors)
in multidistrict proceedings (the events).111 Bipartite networks
avoid the loss-of-information problems sometimes associated
with converting an affiliation matrix to one-mode data.112 As
corporate boards do for corporations, lead lawyers make the
full range of pretrial litigation decisions for all of the plaintiffs
within the group and, because leaders are judicially appointed,
we know exactly who is and is not a member, which gives the
network clear boundaries (also known as edges).113
While we cannot identify friendship, cooperation, or even
contrarians by looking directly at the actors, we can look at
agents’ ties to one another and generate hypotheses about their
influence on both social connections and legal norms.114 For
example, our network graphs formal affiliations based on lead-
ership appointments, but friendships, joint ventures, and rival-
ries  may  contribute  to  or  result  from  these  formal
appointments.115 While some social network studies antici-
pate linkages and hierarchies,116 we make no such assump-
tions about the structure of leaders at the outset. Instead, by
looking at statistical measures of degree centrality (the number
of  connections  a  node—attorney  or  proceeding—makes),
betweenness centrality (how often a node is on a path between
two other nodes), and eigen values (how close one powerful
node is to another), we can begin to understand how the net-
work formed, and who is most important within it. From there

we can formulate and explore hypotheses about control, influ-
ence, and power as well as theoretical propositions about infor-
mation flow, norm development, and norm entrenchment.117
We provide an overview of network terminology below in Table
2.118
TABLE 2: SOCIAL NETWORK TERMINOLOGY
Social
network term Applied definition
Node An attorney or multidistrict proceeding in the network
Centrality The position of a node (attorney or proceeding) in the network;
more central nodes have more potential to influence others, act as
gatekeepers, and receive “flows” such as information or financial
support; central actors tend to have more social capital
Degree Indicates how many ties one attorney or proceeding has to other
centrality attorneys or proceedings within the data; nodes with high degree
centrality tend to be those that insiders might flag as integral to
complex proceedings
Betweenness Indicates how often a node is on the shortest path to other nodes
centrality (think of a bridge, for example); nodes with high betweenness
centrality tend to have a high potential for gatekeeping or toll-
taking and have power because they can filter, distort, or threaten
to stop transmitting information
Eigen value Indicates how close one node is to other well-connected nodes;
centrality nodes with high eigen values tend to indicate popularity—they
connect to well-connected others
In the context of multidistrict proceedings, these network
insights  are  especially  important.  As  other  studies  have
shown,  attorneys  in  multidistrict  litigation  are  repeat
players.119 The more often they appear in proceedings, the
more likely they are to be appointed to leadership positions,
and being in leadership means having the opportunity to play
for rules. As we discussed in subpart I.C, the same attorneys
appearing in multiple proceedings could have advantages and
disadvantages.  Leadership  consistency  offers  a  number  of
benefits, both to the litigants who rely on experienced repeat
players to win their case and net a high reward, and to judges
who may have handled few, if any, multidistrict proceedings
and  perceive  the  attorneys  as  a  reliable  source  of  case-
management information.
Of course, repeat players’ informational advantage may
also have a downside: less high-profile attorneys who have
extensive experience in the trenches of discovery committees

are closed out of opportunities to gain leadership experience,
leaders’ perspectives and heuristics may be less diverse, and,
even  when  privy  to  unique  information  that  others  lack,
attorneys may not share it for fear the dominant group member
will disapprove.120 Such dissent might be particularly useful
in  both  ensuring  adequate  representation  for  “outliers”
(plaintiffs with idiosyncratic injuries or circumstances) and for
the group as a whole.
Knowing what the network looks like and who is key within
it provides additional information to researchers examining the
role of attorneys in multidistrict litigation. Before we delve into
the network, however, a word of caution is in order. While our
list  of  products-liability  proceedings  contains  a  substantial
number of the cases centralized by the Panel as well as a
substantial number of the attorneys in those proceedings, it is
not exhaustive. Without a complete list of all proceedings, it is
difficult to speculate about how important specific attorneys or
litigations are to the entire world of complex litigation. As
such, our discussion focuses on the importance of attorneys
and proceedings in the network created with our data. The
scope of the data suggests that the results are generalizable
outside the realm of products liability (and indeed the results
below are consistent with past work), but we cannot say with
certainty that what we find is true across all proceeding types,
or even for all products-liability cases for all time. Nonetheless,
the importance of products-liability proceedings to the larger
world of civil litigation suggests this is an appropriate starting
place  to  examine  attorneys’  relationships  as  well  as  their
influence.
C. Results

Using our database of 73 products-liability and sales-prac-
tices multidistrict litigations, we graphed the network among
the participating lead lawyers. Our data include plaintiff and
defense attorneys, the leadership roles they held, how many
total appearances they make in the data, the size of the pro-
ceeding, and how many appearances the attorney’s firm made.

work among entities provides insights into data that cannot be

sight. Still, our work is meant to generate hypotheses, not to
test them per se.
FIGURE 2: LEAD LAWYER NETWORK, PRODUCTS-LIABILITY AND SALES-

The network created among lead products-liability lawyers
in our data is quite cohesive. As Figure 2 above shows, there is
a single densely populated network, and two much smaller
isolated networks on the periphery. The smaller networks in-
clude litigation over Porsche’s plastic coolant tubes122 and the

Factor VII or IX blood products litigation.123 These two litiga-
tions do not share any leadership counsel common to the rest
of the larger network. Unlike many other proceedings in our
data, the blood products litigation involved only three lead law-
yers and contained 337 total actions, making it a relatively
small proceeding in both overall size and number of leadership
counsel. Porsche Cars featured the unusual event of a judge
appointing an entire firm co-lead counsel. The whole proceed-
ing encompassed only eight actions, again making it a small
proceeding relative to others in our data. The size of the pro-
ceedings suggests that they are outliers as they may not pre-
sent  the  case  management  challenges  typical  of  most
multidistrict products-liability proceedings.
The larger network features more of the principal products-
liability proceedings that appear in the academic literature and
in media coverage. Both proceedings and attorneys have key
roles in the network’s cohesion. Four of the pelvic-mesh cases
are in the center of the network,124 and most connections radi-
ate from this core set of proceedings. The pelvic-mesh cases
comprise 55% of all cases pending in multidistrict proceed-
ings—the largest grouping since the asbestos litigations.125
Given the number of participating attorneys and the appoint-
ment of the same 62 attorneys to leadership in four of the five
pelvic-mesh proceedings, this is hardly surprising. What is
interesting, however, is how these proceedings feature some
but not all of the attorneys most central to the network. Look-
ing specifically at degree centrality emphasizes this point.

CENTRALITY HIGHLIGHTED
Figure 3 above highlights degree centrality. In general, the
more central a node (actor or event) is to a network, the more
opportunities it has to influence others and receive information
and support from others in the network.126 That, in turn, gives
those actors social capital; people who are more central to a
network may have opportunities and advantages that those on
the periphery lack.127 Higher degree centrality—the number of
ties a node has to other nodes—may indicate influential insid-
ers who are well positioned to control how information flows
over the network and to spin that information in ways that
benefit them.128 As such, the literature on repeat players sug-

gests that degree centrality is a particularly apt measurement:
attorneys appointed as leaders in more proceedings can make
more connections.129
Those events with the highest degree centrality include
four of the pelvic-mesh proceedings130 and litigation against
the New England Compounding Pharmacy.131 The attorneys
with the highest degree centrality include Richard Arsenault,
Daniel Becnel, Jr., Dianne Nast, Christopher Seeger, and Jer-
rold Parker. Many of these attorneys appear in a substantial
number of proceedings, both generally and in our data specifi-
cally. Arsenault is featured in eighteen proceedings in our
data, Seeger appears in sixteen, Becnel and Nast each appear
in fourteen, and Parker appears in eleven. They are well con-
nected, so to speak, and presumably exhibit judicially pre-
ferred  characteristics  of  experience,  cooperative  tendencies,
and an ability to finance the litigation.
Interestingly, however, the proceedings in which these at-
torneys appear are not the same. Becnel and Seeger do not
appear as leaders in any of the five proceedings with the high-
est  degree  centrality:  the  pelvic-mesh  cases  against  C.R.
Bard,132 American Medical Systems,133 Boston Scientific,134
and Ethicon,135 or the New England Compounding Pharmacy
litigation.136 In fact, what links these two lawyers with the rest
of the network is their participation in Accutane.137 Of the
eleven proceedings most central to the network (based on all
measures of centrality) Becnel appears in only two and Seeger
appears in only one. It appears that the importance of these
two attorneys to this network is in linking those proceedings

and attorneys in the upper right portion of the network to the
central nest. Extending this analysis to other types of multidis-
trict proceedings may show a different pattern.
FIGURE 4: LEAD LAWYER NETWORK, PRODUCTS-LIABILITY AND

BETWEENNESS HIGHLIGHTED
Figure 4 illustrates betweenness. Betweenness centrality
measures how often a given attorney or proceeding falls along
the shortest path to other attorneys or proceedings.138 It helps
to identify which events or actors might play either a gatekeep-
ing or toll-taking role, for nodes with high betweenness rank-
138 See BORGATTIETAL., supra note 112, at 174; Katz & Stafford, supra note 16, R
at 495 (“[B]etweenness centrality is often used to identify the bridges between
different communities and clusters. To identify these gatekeepers, betweenness
calculates the shortest paths (known as geodesics) between all pairs of vertices,
identifies the frequency of each node appearing on those paths, then normalizes
the statistic.”).\\jciprod01\productn\C\CRN\102-6\CRN602.txt unknown Seq: 37 29-SEP-17 12:56

ings can act as information brokers—relaying, distorting, or
disrupting the information they pass to others.139 When attor-
neys form the shortest distance from one attorney to the next,
they might engage in rent extraction or gatekeeping; the effi-
ciency of the network requires information to flow through
them, which increases their power within the network. These
lawyers join otherwise disparate groups. Attorneys with high
betweenness rankings may likewise broker litigation financing
arrangements between plaintiffs’ law firms or negotiate global
settlements.
Looking at the betweenness ranking, we find a list of lead
attorneys similar to those in the degree centrality discussion,
but a different list of proceedings. While New England Com-
pounding Pharmacy is also on this list,140 the other proceedings
are different, including Accutane,141 Fosamax,142 Propecia,143
and Yasmin/Yaz.144 Interestingly, unlike the degree centrality
list (composed of the pelvic-mesh cases—involving a medical
device), here we see pharmaceutical litigations. The attorney
list—Richard Arsenault, Daniel Becnel, Jr., Dianne Nast, Joe
Rice, and Christopher Seeger—is almost exactly the same, with
the exception of Joe Rice appearing in place of Jerrold Parker.
Rice makes an interesting series of connections in the network,
tying the largest multidistrict litigation of all time, Asbestos,145
and litigation over BP’s Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill146 to all
other proceedings. Without his appearance in leadership in
both  proceedings,  neither  Deepwater  Horizon  nor  Asbestos
would connect to the rest of the nest in our data.
Overall,  the  network  shows  a  strong,  cohesive  center,
where attorneys participate in leadership in many multidistrict
proceedings, and a set of attorneys with relatively few connec-
tions, both to proceedings and other lead lawyers. To clarify
the center of the network, we kept the attorneys participating

pelvic-mesh litigations148 are to each other in terms of the par-
ticipating attorneys. In fact, as Figure 6 below shows, if we look
at the entities with the highest eigen values (attorneys and
proceedings closest to other key attorneys and proceedings), we
find that those four proceedings include all five attorneys who
have the highest eigen values: Richard Arsenault, Dianne Nast,
Jerrold Parker, Jane Conroy, and Michelle Parfitt.
Figure 6 illustrates how much pull those four pelvic-mesh
proceedings have on the current picture of multidistrict litiga-
tion provided by our data. Highlighting eigen value indicates a
way to consider an attorney’s importance in a relative way: how
important are the attorneys to which that attorney is con-
nected?149 While degree centrality measures the number of
connections, and betweenness measures how key an attorney
is to connecting other parts of the network efficiently, eigen
value considers the importance of the connections an attorney
makes. It is perhaps here where the centers of power are most
likely to be seen. The four pelvic-mesh proceedings, and the
attorneys participating in them, are central to the network of all
attorneys with a leadership role in two or more products-liabil-
ity proceedings. This is likely in part because so many of the
attorneys in one pelvic-mesh litigation are in another (which is
why they rank so highly in degree centrality), but also because
these cases involve some of the attorneys most common to all
multidistrict products-liability proceedings. In other words,
the related nature of the pelvic-mesh proceedings strengthens
ties among lawyers who were already interacting with each
other more than one would find outside the realm of complex
litigation.

others are to copy that behavior.151 Add to that that intercon-
nected agents can have emergent properties—that networked
people can demonstrate complicated, shared behavior without
explicitly coordinating with each other—and hypotheses about
the potential for norm development and entrenchment can be
extensive.152
What we can determine with certainty is that attorneys
with more appearances in proceedings are more likely to be
appointed to leadership positions, and attorneys in leadership
design master settlement agreements. If we look specifically at
the type of leadership roles we can begin to separate those
making the rules from those merely playing by them. All the
attorneys in our network served in some leadership position
within a multidistrict litigation, but even among this highly
experienced group of attorneys there are those who appear
more often than others. Table 3 below shows how much lead-
ership  experience  the  top  twenty-five  repeat  plaintiffs-side
players in our dataset have, followed by Table 4, which illus-
trates the leadership experience among the defense bar by

153 Judicial appointments to leadership roles on the defense side are rare and
typically used only in cases where the number of defendants requires more formal
coordination. More comprehensive lists of leadership appearances by the top 50
attorneys in our data, as well as firm experience, is available in the Appendix.\\jciprod01\productn\C\CRN\102-6\CRN602.txt unknown Seq: 42 29-SEP-17 12:56

1488 CORNELL LAW REVIEW [Vol.102:1445
Typically, highly experienced attorneys serve on a steering
committee  in  addition  to  serving  in  one  other  leadership
position within a proceeding.154 The attorneys shown to be
central  to  the  network  above  have  the  greatest  amount  of
experience in leadership positions as well. Again, while these
results  are  not  surprising  (more  experience  in  these
proceedings means more opportunities for leadership, and one
leadership  appointment  makes  the  next  leadership
appointment more likely), it is important to point out that
attorneys who are central to a network of products-liability
proceedings are not only powerful for their connections to other
attorneys, but for their leadership in conducting and shaping
the  proceedings.  These  attorneys  broker  the  master
settlements that resolve these cases. This raises the question
of what their deals look like, as well as the unanswerable
question about how those deals might differ if courts appointed
non-central attorneys to leadership.
III
EMPIRICALLY ASSESSING THE DEALS THOSE REPEAT
PLAYERS DESIGN
How might well-connected lead lawyers’ ties affect the set-
tlements they design? As Professors Nicholas Christakis and
James  Fowler  demonstrated,  social  networks  can  have
profound effects on people’s lives—they can spread joy and
health and help us understand how markets and democracies
function, but they can also spread things like depression, vio-
lence, and even suicide.155 They find that all social networks
“tend to magnify whatever they are seeded with.”156 We can
only guess at the seeds in multidistrict litigation. As Part I
explained, transferee judges try to select cooperative, exper-
ienced, and well-financed leaders and presumably encourage
efficiency in accordance with the authorizing statute’s mis-
sion.157 But, because all of these leaders are agents, we must
154 We might begin to think of this as positional inequality—the notion that
some are better off based on where they are located within the network. Their
situational inequality might be causally related to positional inequality, for if
judges routinely select those attorneys with more financial means (situational
inequality due to socioeconomics) then they are likely to be better connected
positionally within the network. See CHRISTAKIS & FOWLER, supra note 18, at 31. R

also consider the possibility of a more troubling seed: an agent
may better herself at her principal’s expense.
To be clear, there is no way for us to reliably test what flows
through our network.158 By looking at the settlements that
well-connected leaders implement and the fee practices they
influence, however, we can formulate better-informed hypothe-
ses about the network’s effects. Using a variety of sources
(including media stories and docket entries from the proceed-
ings), we analyzed the publicly available nonclass settlements
that resulted within our dataset, the accompanying lead law-
yers’ common-benefit fee awards, and the attorneys in leader-
ship  roles  who  designed  the  settlements.  Specifically,  as
indicia of advantages that repeat players might enjoy that one-
shotters do not, we looked for provisions that one might argue
principally benefit the lead lawyers and the defendants, and
not necessarily the plaintiffs. We focused our inquiry on four
main types of provisions: (1) those that induce claimants to
settle and thereby generate closure for defendants; (2) those
compensating  lead  lawyers;  (3)  those  that  allow  unclaimed
funds to revert to the defendant; and (4) those that reduce
payout amounts to latecomers who do not have counsel as of
the settlement date.
This enterprise has two notable caveats. First, settlement
provisions designed to induce claimants to settle can deliver
closure that unlocks gains for the settling plaintiffs that may
not exist otherwise—a “peace premium.”159 Defendants, par-
ticularly those with publicly traded stock, are often eager to
end lawsuits and ease shareholders’ minds about future busi-
ness prospects. In class actions, defendants accomplished clo-
sure  through  a  combination  of  preclusion  doctrines  and
walkaway provisions, which allowed defendants to withdraw
the settlement offer if too many class members opted out. The
need for finality persists even when multidistrict litigation con-
cludes through a nonclass, aggregate settlement. But, without
a certified class, closure requires more creativity in settlement
design. The trouble comes both in the lack of structural assur-
ances of adequate representation in appointing leaders on the
front end, and on the back end in policing the line between
acceptable settlement tactics that rational claimants should
accept because the offer is too good to decline and those that
158 We do not have access to attorneys’ financial assets, for example, and for
reasons explored elsewhere, attorneys are unlikely to be candid if interviewed.

claimants can’t refuse in The Godfather sense—a gun to the
head accompanied by assurances that either the person’s sig-
nature or brains would appear on the contract.160
Second, lead lawyers may perform the lion’s share of the
work in any given multidistrict litigation, and they should be
compensated for their performance insofar as it benefits claim-
ants.161 But allowing lead lawyers to negotiate their fees with
the defendant—either by inserting fee-related provisions within
the settlement or by having the defendant pay their fees di-
rectly—is troubling. Leadership fees are big business: using a
settlement agreement to contract around the initial judicial fee
award in Guidant, for example, boosted lead lawyers’ fees by
$29.7 million.162 And while defendants must be on board with
the deal, they are not na¨ıve; fee provisions may cost them noth-
ing if they come from the plaintiffs’ share of the funds, yet
defendants receive a powerful bargaining chip that they might
exchange for things like lower settlement amounts, higher par-
ticipation rates, or stringent criteria to qualify for settlement
money.163 Moreover, through settlement consent, lead lawyers
might be able to tax state-court plaintiffs who eluded federal
jurisdiction and the transferee judge’s common-benefit assess-
ment. Perhaps lead lawyers confer a benefit here as well, but
the fee assessments are typically uniform and not tailored to
quantum-meruit principles.164
Class settlements can include coercive provisions designed
to deliver closure, too.165 In the Sulzer hip implant litigation,
for example, defendant Sulzer hired Dickie Scruggs, a noted
plaintiffs’ attorney, to design a class settlement that minimized
opt outs.166 Among other provisions, that settlement placed
liens on virtually all the defendants’ assets in favor of settling
class members such that the opt outs would have to wait at
least six years before receiving payment.167 And if Sulzer set-

these terms. Richard A. Nagareda, Closure in Damage Class Settlements: The

tled with an opt-out claimant on more favorable terms than
those in the settlement, it would have to pay all participating
class members more as well.168 Functioning a bit like a dooms-
day device that would never actually be triggered, the idea was
to signal to opt-outs that they would never receive a better deal
than what the settlement offered. As Scruggs described it, “[I]f
anybody opts out, they still have to try their case, win their
case, win their appeal, and then there would be no assets to
satisfy their judgment, because they are all pledged to the
class.”169
But the circumstances in multidistrict proceedings make
closure and fee-related clauses even more troubling. In Sulzer,
objectors (whose attorneys stood to gain fees only if their objec-
tion improved the deal170) challenged the legitimacy of those
provisions on appeal, which led settlement designers to boost
benefits to class members, change the deal’s questionable pro-
visions, and remove the lien—all before the Sixth Circuit could
rule on the original settlement.171 Nonclass aggregate settle-
ments, by contrast, are private deals with no appellate review
to correct error or threaten change. Judges do not ensure the
settlement is fair under Rule 23(e), subject lead lawyers to ade-
quate representation scrutiny under Rule 23(a)(4), or have ex-
plicit control over attorneys’ fees under Rule 23(h). As such,
nonclass  settlements  lack  key  structural  failsafes.  Thus,
clauses that appear to principally benefit the attorneys rather
than their clients raise significant concerns.
Turning to the settlements themselves, of the seventy-three
products-liability and sales-practices multidistrict litigations
in our dataset, we were able to obtain private, nonclass settle-
ments in ten multidistrict litigations (three of which generated
two settlements each for a total of thirteen settlements),172
class settlements in twenty, and one bankruptcy-related settle-
ment.173 One of the nonclass settlements (in the American
Medical Systems litigation) is a partial settlement: it covers

that when objectors confer a benefit on the class, they should receive attorneys’
fees).
171 See Nagareda, supra note 50, at 205 n.240 (2003) (“A preliminary ruling by R
the Sixth Circuit did not bode well for that court’s ultimate disposition of the
settlement and, as such, spurred negotiations that ultimately recast the deal.”).

only the claimants represented by two law firms, not all the
pending claims. Because the other settlements in that case
were confidential, we could not determine whether that settle-
ment was representative of the others. Twenty-one other mul-
tidistrict litigations in our data have also settled; however,
those aggregate settlements were confidential and nonpublic.
Because this Article focuses on the practices and norms
that develop outside of directly authorized judicial supervision
under established class-action principles, we limited our anal-
ysis to the thirteen publicly available nonclass settlements that
resulted from ten multidistrict litigations. Our analysis, while
limited, nevertheless provides some interesting insights into
what the settlements brokered by repeat players look like. And
though the number of publicly available private settlements
was relatively small, the proceedings in which those settle-
ments occurred collectively included 64,107 total actions.174

2017] REPEAT PLAYERS IN MULTIDISTRICT LITIGATION 1495
A. Settlement Attorneys
Before examining these thirteen settlements, we must first
confirm that the repeat players we previously discussed partici-
pated  in  leadership  positions  when  these  agreements  were
brokered. Not surprisingly, the plaintiffs’ attorneys who fre-
quently appeared as leaders in our data were key to these
settlements.
The multidistrict proceedings we examined varied in terms
of the number of repeat players appointed to leadership posi-
tions. Zimmer Durom Hip Cup, American Medical Systems,175
and Propulsid were at the high end, with repeat players occupy-
ing 100, 100, and 90% of the plaintiffs’ leadership positions,
respectively. Yasmin/Yaz and DePuy ASR followed suit with
repeat players in 89 and 80% of those positions. Actos and
Fosamax had slightly fewer repeat players, with 68% in Actos
and 66% in Fosamax. Both Biomet and Vioxx filled around half
of the plaintiffs’ leadership positions with repeat players—58%
in Biomet and 50% in Vioxx. And NuvaRing contained the few-
est repeat players, with 35%.
What became apparent in reviewing the settlements, how-
ever, was that it was not so much the sheer number of repeat
players involved in a proceeding that seemingly affected the
outcome, but the influence of a relatively small cadre of high-
level, well-connected repeat players occupying the most power-
ful positions who actively designed and implemented those set-
tlements. Our findings here are consistent with those in other
disciplines; in research and development laboratories, for ex-
ample, about six individuals act as information and technologi-
cal gatekeepers, or bridges, in network terms.176 Table 6 below
shows which attorneys with the highest degree centrality (to
take  one  measure)  appeared  as  leaders  in  the  examined
settlements.

B. Settlement Provisions and Lead Lawyers’ Fees
Given the interconnections among these attorneys in our
data, it should not be surprising to find commonality in the
settlement provisions. What may be surprising, however, is
how closely these settlement provisions mirror one another,
beginning with the two Propulsid settlements. The Propulsid
settlements were the first nonclass settlements in our data,
and, as we show, they appear to be the template that repeat
players sought to replicate and improve upon in future settle-
ments. As such, we introduce these settlements in detail to
highlight the means by which leaders resolved mass litigation
without  the  class  device—principally  through  widespread
plaintiff participation requirements. As we note, these settle-
ments not only helped end the litigation for the defendant, but
paid plaintiffs’ lawyers directly for doing so. The question that
lingers,  however,  is  whether  these  developments  benefitted
one-shot plaintiffs.
In the first Propulsid settlement, three provisions worked
in concert to induce closure. First, the deal required 85% of
those with death claims and 75% of those with injury claims to
enroll in the program before the agreement took effect.178 Sec-
ond, to entice plaintiffs to participate, the settlement escalated
the defendant’s payment amounts based on higher participa-
177 Note that we have only one of several aggregate settlements negotiated with
American Medical Systems. The others are confidential.

tion percentages and included a $4 million “bonus” if 100% of
non-death claimants enrolled.179 Third, an “opt-out” form ac-
companied the settlement even though the settlement was not
a class action and all claimants had to affirmatively “opt in.”180
Designed for plaintiffs who refused to enroll, this form ex-
plained that the client’s chosen attorney was no longer permit-
ted  to  represent  her  under  the  settlement’s  terms  and
authorized counsel to withdraw from the representation.181
So, the client was opting out of representation—not just declin-
ing the settlement offer.
Somewhat like arbitration, submitting claims to the settle-
ment program extinguished them, win or lose. After four years,
the panel of three physicians reviewing claims deemed only 11
of 1,356 claimants eligible for payouts.182 Still, the program
could not bind absent plaintiffs as a class action does, and the
first settlement did not cover 2,000 state-court plaintiffs or
5,000 claimants who had not filed as of February 1, 2004.183
Nevertheless, by using a lodestar analysis that estimated
the attorney’s fee from the money deposited for awards instead
of the money actually paid to claimants, the court awarded the
Plaintiffs’ Steering Committee a fee of $22.5 million.184 No one
objected.185
At the end of the first settlement only 32 out of 4,245
plaintiffs satisfied the settlement’s claims criteria and were eli-
gible for relief.186 Collectively, those 32 plaintiffs received little
more than $3.66 million.187 The remaining settlement funds
went elsewhere: two donations of more than $8 million each

Given the continued need to resolve the remaining claims,
in December of 2005, reportedly at the behest of counsel repre-
senting  state-court  plaintiffs,  the  federal  Plaintiffs’  Steering
Committee and the State Liaison Committee negotiated Propul-
sid II. This $15 million settlement mostly mirrored the first
one, but required 90% of death claimants and 95% of personal-
injury claimants to consent before becoming effective.191 This
time, the physician panel found only 5 out of 1,767 claimants
compensable, and Johnson & Johnson paid slightly more than
$2.85 million from the settlement fund.192 Nevertheless, the
Plaintiffs’ Steering Committee requested over $4.1 million in
fees.193 Once again, no objections to that motion appeared on
the docket, and the court granted the request.194 The court

settlement fund to the defendant, as well as the remaining
balance of all settlement and administrative funds.195 As the
litigation concluded, lead lawyers requested and received the
additional six-percent holdback fund put in place at the begin-
ning of the litigation for common-benefit fee awards, which
taxed settlements that occurred before the master settlement
agreements, and equaled $397,860.196
The lead lawyers in Propulsid noted that their settlements
were the first of their kind to globally resolve mass litigation
without the class device and, as such, “promise[d] to become
the template” for future cases.197 Using Propulsid as a base-
line, we examined the other eleven settlements in our database
for similar closure and common-benefit fee provisions. We
find, overwhelmingly, that the settlement model produced in
the Propulsid settlements is carried out in various respects
through all other settlements in our database. The principal
variations in the other settlements included how many plain-
tiffs had to participate in the settlement for it to take effect and
whether settlement money reverted back to the defendant in
the end. Table 7 below shows how the small group of attorneys
negotiating, designing, and implementing future settlements in
our database consistently applied, again and again, both the
closure provisions and the common-benefit fee awards created

1502 CORNELL LAW REVIEW [Vol.102:1445
Looking closely at Table 7 above and Figure 7 below shows
that even though all the settlements share and replicate certain
features, some resemble one another even more closely. Take
DePuy ASR, NuvaRing, Actos, and Yasmin/Yaz, for example.
All employ what we call “third generation”198 versions of both
attorney-withdrawal provisions and defendant-walkaway pro-
visions in which designers enlist judges to issue “case-census”
orders that enable leaders to take stock of both pending and
unfiled claims in determining whether plaintiff participation
requirements are met.199 These four litigations shared a host
of common lead lawyers, lead law firms, and claims adminis-
trators as Figure 7 below visually demonstrates. For instance,
Richard Arsenault was a lead lawyer in DePuy ASR, NuvaRing,
and Actos, and Chris Seeger and Mark Robinson, Jr. helped
lead DePuy, Yaz, and Actos.
Network models share inherent limitations in depicting
real-world events: “nodes” in real life have multiple flows with
other nodes, like claims administrators. Figure 7 shows, for
example, that BrownGreer, PLC administered all four of these
settlements.

1504 CORNELL LAW REVIEW [Vol.102:1445
1. Closure Provisions
As Propulsid illustrates, without a class-action judgment’s
claim  preclusive  effect,  settlement  designers  have  experi-
mented with a number of alternative closure devices that are
sometimes used alone, and sometimes used in concert with
one another. Yet, all the settlements in our database uniformly
featured one key departure from conventional settlements: un-
like  typical  settlements  between  plaintiffs  and  defendants,
these deals were made between lead lawyers and the defend-
ants, and most of them explicitly required the plaintiff’s indi-
vidual attorney to become a signatory if she wanted to enroll a
single client in the settlement program. By shifting the deal-
making entity from the client to the lawyer, these offers lever-
aged the attorney-client relationship itself to achieve closure
and tied plaintiffs’ attorneys’ financial self-interest to one an-
other as opposed to a particular client. Put differently, we saw
a  uniform  departure  from  the  conventional  contingent-fee
model where an attorney’s fees increase solely based on a par-
ticular client’s outcome.
In common parlance, we refer to these interrelated closure
provisions as follows: (1) walkaway provisions, which release
the defendant from any contractual obligations if a certain per-
centage of plaintiffs do not consent to settle; (2) case-census
provisions, which rely on the presiding judge to order all attor-
neys to register their filed and unfiled claims by a certain date
such that the defendant can use that number as the denomi-
nator in calculating compliance with the walkaway percentage;
(3) attorney-recommendation provisions, which require partici-
pating attorneys to recommend the deal to all of their clients,
and (4) attorney-withdrawal provisions, which instruct attor-
neys to withdraw from representing clients who do not consent
to settle.
Across all the settlements in our database, we found the
most common closure provision to be the defendant’s ability to
walk away from its settlement offer if too few plaintiffs ac-
cepted. The threshold for the defendant to abandon the settle-
ment varied somewhat. In Vioxx, if fewer than 85% of plaintiffs
accepted, Merck could walk away and leave the plaintiffs and
their attorneys with nothing.200 In Fosamax, the stakes were
even higher. If a single claimant or attorney failed to sign onto
the deal, Merck (again the defendant) could void the agree-

ment.201 Alternatively, Merck could reduce the settlement by
however much it would have paid the non-participating claim-
ants (as determined by the allocation committee).202 Both De-
Puy ASR settlements took a middle path, requiring 94% of
claimants to accept before the deal took effect.203
Several  settlements  included  an  overall  participation
threshold as well as specific levels for various claims catego-
ries. The two Yasmin/Yaz settlements set the overall walkaway
percentage at 90% of all eligible gallbladder claimants,204 and
97.5%  of  all  arterial-thromboembolic-event  (“ATE”)  claim-

95% of wrongful-death claims, and 95% of various specific cat-

Case-census  provisions,  a  relatively  new  development,
work in concert with walkaway thresholds to create the per-
centage’s denominator. By jointly petitioning both the trans-
feree judge and the coordinating state-court judges, census or
“registration”  provisions  produce  case-management  orders
that require all attorneys who represent a single plaintiff in the
issuing courts to register all claims relating to the product in
which the attorney has an interest (broadly defined to include
“any financial interest of any kind whatsoever”) by a certain
date.211 These orders cover all claims, including those that are
unfiled, pending in other courts, or controlled by attorneys who
decline to recommend the deal to any client.212 Failing to com-
ply with the judicial census triggers a show-cause hearing for
counsel to satisfactorily explain the noncompliance or face dis-
missal.  The  Vioxx  settlement,213  both  DePuy  ASR  settle-

pending  the  conclusion  of  the  settlement’s  mediation
process.220
The  attorney  recommendation  and  attorney  withdrawal
provisions from Propulsid were also common across the settle-
ments in our database, with some form of recommendation
included in all but the Zimmer Durom Hip Cup and Biomet
settlements, and explicit, mandatory attorney-withdrawal pro-
visions in Vioxx,221 Fosamax,222 and American Medical Sys-
tems.223 As in Propulsid, the recommendation and withdrawal
provisions in these three proceedings worked in concert to re-
quire an attorney who had a single client who wanted to accept
the settlement offer—whether in the multidistrict proceeding or
state court—to recommend that all of her clients accept the
deal. If a client refused to do so, the attorney had to withdraw
from representing her. Essentially, these provisions tie the at-
torneys’ desire to be paid for their services to the defendant’s
desire for closure. After Vioxx, commentators frequently dis-
cussed and criticized that link,224 which may have prompted
settlement designers in Actos, NuvaRing, and Yasmin/Yaz to
require only that the lead lawyers “use their best efforts to
achieve  sufficient  participation  to  meet  the  participation
benchmarks necessary to effectuate the Program.”225 The Yas-
min/Yaz gallbladder settlement, however, contained an addi-
tional provision that automatically enrolled the plaintiffs in the
settlement and required them to either affirmatively opt-out of

221 Vioxx Settlement, supra note 200, §1.2.8.1. After some plaintiffs’ attorneys R
contended the settlement conflicted with ethical rules, it was reinterpreted to
mean that the attorneys should recommend the deal only if it was in the client’s
best interest. See Alex Berenson, Some Lawyers Seek Changes in Vioxx Settle-
ment, N.Y. TIMES, Dec. 21, 2007; see also In re Vioxx Prods. Liab. Litig., 388 Fed.
Appx. 391, 395–97 (5th Cir. July 16, 2010) (affirming district court judge’s han-
dling of non-settling plaintiffs).
222 Fosamax Settlement, supra note 200, ¶¶ 1–2, 5 & Ex. C at C-15 (certifica-

numerous’ attorneys motions to withdraw from representing non-settling claim-
ants. E.g., In re Fosamax Prods. Liab. Litig., 06-md-1789 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 22,
2014) (order allowing Levin, Papantonio, Thomas, Mitchell, Rafferty & Proctor,
P.A. to withdraw as counsel).
223 Even if 95% of the claimants took the offer, the agreement still required
counsel to “employ their best efforts to obtain an executed Release from 100%,”
and if a client refused those overtures, counsel had to withdraw from representing
that client. American Medical Systems Settlement, supra note 207, §§II.H–I. R

the arrangement (even though it was not a class action) or
submit a claim package before the deadline.226
The two DePuy ASR settlements varied slightly in their
recommendation and withdrawal provisions. Individual signa-
tory attorneys—not just lead lawyers—had to “represent and
warrant that they each will use their best efforts to secure all
documentation required for timely enrollment and compliance
with  this  Agreement,”227  and,  subject  to  their  professional
judgment, “endorse enrollment in the U.S. Program to clients
covered by this Agreement.”228 Instead of requiring plaintiffs’
counsel to withdraw from representing those clients who pre-
ferred not to settle, the Special Master could determine that a
law firm or interested counsel “did not act in good faith in
connection with the informed consent process and participa-
tion,”229 and DePuy, “at its sole option,” could expel that firm’s
or that attorney’s other clients from the settlement.230
In sum, Figure 8 below illustrates how highly connected
repeat players have replicated and advanced Propulsid’s clo-
sure provisions, presumably in response to feedback and defi-
ciencies they perceived in prior settlements. Propulsid may well
have been a tipping point in handling nonclass litigation. But,
because it is the earliest available nonclass settlement in our
data, we cannot be certain. Generally speaking, tipping points
occur when innovations take off in a network, as it seems that
Propulsid’s closure provisions did.231 And it appears that re-
peat players in our network used their connections to diffuse
and perfect settlement practices originating from Propulsid.232
As such, well-connected attorneys may not only lead litiga-
tions, they may also occupy roles as influential opinion leaders;
individuals who are central to a network and rank highly on
betweenness measures can be especially effective at transmit-
ting and diffusing new ideas and practices.233

2. Common-Benefit Fee Awards
One such practice has evolved with regard to enhancing
leaders’ common-benefit fees. Transferee judges often issue an
order at the beginning of litigation that establishes a common-
benefit fund to pay lead lawyers for their fees and costs by
taxing the individual attorneys and their clients a specific per-
centage of clients’ gross settlement proceeds.234 While judges
have cited various rationales for their authority,235 the orders
essentially create a take-it-or-leave-it proposition, where “leav-
ing it” means referring clients to someone else or, if possible,
filing suit in state court where individual attorneys may never-
theless have to contribute if their clients want to participate in
a global settlement that federal leadership negotiates. While
lead lawyers with clients will have to contribute to the fund too,
their money will eventually transfer from one pocket to the
other at the same rate, unless the judge awards that leader less
of a common-benefit fee. Our analysis of the settlements and
attorneys’ fees found not only that common-benefit fees are
typically awarded, but that they are frequently increased dur-
ing the litigation when leaders request a judicially awarded
raise, negotiate some aspect of their fees with the defendant

Midstream fee increases took a variety of forms. In DePuy
ASR, the court initially assessed a 3% common-benefit fee plus
1% for costs.236 But after the plaintiffs’ steering committee
negotiated a settlement that required each plaintiff who set-
tled—whether  in  federal  or  state  court—to  consent  to  the
transferee court’s fee order, it then requested that the court

2017] REPEAT PLAYERS IN MULTIDISTRICT LITIGATION 1511
increase fees from 3 to 5%, leaving 1% for costs intact.237 No
one objected, and the court made the change.238 Similarly, in
the Yasmin/Yaz litigation, a request from the lead lawyers in-
creased the assessments from 4 to 9%,239 with the court noting
that no one opposed the motion and that the increase received
“unanimous consent by the PSC.”240 Unlike DePuy and Yaz,
one attorney in the NuvaRing litigation did object to fees, but
only as to his own payout as a steering committee member.241
Yet, the NuvaRing plaintiffs’ steering committee was united in
asking the court to raise its common-benefit assessment from
5% fees and 3% costs to 11% for attorneys’ fees (to be sub-
tracted from primary counsel’s fees) and 4.5% for costs (sub-
tracted from clients’ settlement amount).242
Not only did plaintiffs’ leadership request and receive fee
increases midstream, but in three of the examined settlements
lead lawyers negotiated their payment directly with the defen-
dant. That practice first appeared in the tobacco litigation243
and continues now, appearing in both Propulsid settlements,
and in the Biomet settlement. In the first and second Propulsid
settlements, lead lawyers negotiated a $22.5 million fee244 and
a $4 million fee,245 respectively. The court later authorized

these  amounts  through  its  award,246  and  then  added
$397,860.00 based on the 6% common-benefit fund it installed
at the litigation’s outset.247
Biomet is likewise interesting as it was the only settlement
to feature a choice for those on the Plaintiffs’ Steering Commit-
tee. Lead lawyers negotiated a $6 million fee directly with the
defendant via a separate agreement—contingent, of course, on
fulfilling the participation percentages necessary to effectuate
the master settlement agreement—as well as a 5% attorneys’
fee assessment (with an additional 1% for costs).248 But the
court’s order required them to accept the lesser of the two—not
both.249 Leaders took the fee they negotiated directly with the
defendant, which was likely far more profitable for them: it
appears that lead lawyers represented the bulk of the clients
(the court needed a new steering committee post-settlement
since most members settled all their clients’ claims),250 so the
defendant may have compensated the steering committee for
work they were already required to perform under their initial
contingent-fee agreement. Put differently, lead lawyers likely
received their full contingent fees plus a $6 million bonus from
defendants.251
Sometimes, even when lead lawyers negotiate aspects of
their fees directly with the defendant, those fees come out of
other plaintiffs’ attorneys’ fees. By inserting fee provisions into
a master settlement such that claimants (and their counsel)
who want to settle must also “consent” to leadership’s height-
ened fee, lead attorneys can reach settling state-court plaintiffs

who would otherwise fall outside of the transferee judge’s juris-
diction. In Actos and Fosamax, lead lawyers included a provi-
sion  that  subjected  all  settling  plaintiffs—including  those
pending in state courts—to the transferee judge’s fee assess-
ment.252 And, in Fosamax, if a lawyer waited until settlement
to agree to the common-benefit tax (as many state-court attor-
neys would) then the court’s common-benefit fund order in-
creased the assessment from 6 to 9%.253 Lead lawyers in Vioxx
went one step further: they contracted around the court’s 3%
fee cap, raised it to 8%, and deducted the entire amount from
individual attorneys’ contingent fees.254 Yet, unlike many of
the cases examined, the carte blanche revision incited numer-
ous objections.255 Accordingly, the judge appointed a liaison
counsel, who oversaw status conferences, discovery, briefing,
and arguments; eventually lead lawyers agreed to reduce their
fee request to 7.5%.256 Nevertheless, the judge reduced the
award to 6.5%, or $315,250,000 in fees—still a notable differ-
ence from the initial 3%.257
Zimmer Durom Hip Cup was notable for initially deviating
from this pattern, but then following it. The judge’s original
common-benefit order included a 4% fee, permitted the court to
adjust that percentage based on factors in the Model Rules of
Professional  Conduct,  and  expressly  struck  language  that
taxed state-court litigants.258 After the court repeatedly re-
duced common-benefit holdbacks in individual cases,259 the
lead lawyers asked for a new order applying the holdback to all
state-court plaintiffs who benefitted from their efforts.260 Cit-

leaders had not conferred benefits on the state plaintiffs, the
court  refused.261  Nevertheless,  when  leaders  negotiated  a
master settlement, they included a provision that unilaterally
taxed all settling plaintiffs 4%.262 The court then ordered all
multidistrict plaintiffs to participate in the settlement, comply
with its deadlines, or face dismissal.263 Because the settlement
required all participating lawyers to register all their cases (filed
or unfiled, in state or federal court),264 lead lawyers effectively
used their bargaining authority with the defendant to expand
the federal court’s jurisdiction and their fee base.
Additionally, we observed a common practice of scaling up
fee assessments based on how quickly individual counsel as-
sented to common-benefit fees. The Fosamax fee request and
order, for example, offered 3% fees and 3% costs for those who
consented (whether in federal or state court) to the assessment
agreement within 90 days, but increased the price to 5% fees
and  3%  costs  for  latecomers;  if  an  attorney  waited  to  see
whether the lead lawyers actually negotiated a beneficial deal
for their clients, then fees and costs increased to 6 and 5,
respectively.265 Likewise, the Yasmin/Yaz litigation assessed
6% initially, and 10% for latecomers.266 Plainly, the point is to
incentivize early buy-in from the individual attorneys whose
contingency fees will be reduced even though the increase may
not align with quantum-meruit principles.267

sented by counsel as of a certain date.268 The idea was to
thwart the Field-of-Dreams problem for the defendant: creating
a claims process can encourage attorneys and plaintiffs (often
with weaker claims) to emerge at the last minute, file suit, and
partake of the settlement.
To discourage this, latecomer provisions immediately re-
duced unrepresented claimants’ awards by 29% and covered
two groups of people: (1) those litigating pro se, and (2) those
who retained attorneys and filed suit after the identified date.
As to the former, DePuy ASR designers claimed that the reduc-
tion simply discounted pro se litigants’ payout to the same
amount they would have received if they had to pay attorneys’
fees, but noted, “there will be an additional Court approved
deduction for common benefit fees and expenses.”269 The sec-
ond group with counsel is even worse off, for they began with
29% less than those who retained counsel before the date and
will then have to pay their primary counsel’s fees and common-
benefit fees out of that reduced award.270 These latecomer pro-
visions help defendants by encouraging attorneys to file all of
their pending cases immediately and by discouraging further
attorney advertising. Plus, the provisions are mostly costless
for lead lawyers who have advanced notice of the provision, can
file all of their claims, and, in DePuy ASR’s case, still receive
latecomers’ common-benefit fees.
In addition to the latecomer reductions, both DePuy ASR
settlements contained reversion clauses: the 29% taken off the
top of unrepresented plaintiffs’ claims reverted to DePuy, the
defendant.271 Propulsid made even greater use of reversion
clauses, initially reverting $40 million of an $87 million fund to
defendant Johnson & Johnson,272 then $5 million of the sec-

reversion clauses have triggered additional scrutiny to deter-
mine whether the settlement’s terms were detrimental to the
class.275 Absent the class device, courts lack the formal au-

principles.276

IMPLICATIONS
Nonclass aggregation has long fostered an uneasy union
between the individual and the collective. This tension plays
out among scholars, as they consistently prioritize one over the
other: some want to use aggregation procedures to regulate
conduct efficiently and deter wrongdoing in order to maximize
social welfare, while others privilege individual autonomy and
consent over the general welfare, aiming to afford individual
justice to victims through their own day in court.277 While

social networks do not ease this fundamental tension, they do
allow us to consider both individuals and groups—to under-
stand how interconnections and interactions among people
and events affect attorneys’ fees and claims resolution, and
how those fees and results may impact individuals’ perceptions
about the justice system.
Mapping the network of attorneys and proceedings and
then analyzing the deals that repeat players design provides us
with some insight into the flow of information between con-
nected repeat players, the replication and refinement of prac-
tices,  and  how  well-connected  leaders  might  use  their
positional influence within the network to create, disseminate,
and perpetuate norms and practices that benefit their working
relationships. As past work considered how these cases com-
pared with non-aggregated litigation and how they proceeded
through federal courts,278 the next logical step was to examine
who shepherded these cases through the legal system and how
they resolved them without Rule 23’s protections. Accordingly,
this Article considered who the repeat lawyers are in a sample
of products-liability and sales-practices proceedings, the con-
nections  between  them,  the  nonclass  settlements  they  de-
signed, and the common-benefit fees they received.
Consistent with past findings, repeat players do exist, and
they serve in leadership positions that allow them to negotiate
master settlements. As we elaborate in this Part, those posi-
tions likewise afford them influence. And their connectedness
in the network may allow them to diffuse, adapt, and replicate
practices that benefitted them financially.279 Consequently,

1518 CORNELL LAW REVIEW [Vol.102:1445
this Part begins by discussing our findings on repeat players’
impact, then postulates that these repetitive interactions could
add to classic principal-agent problems by desensitizing law-
yers to behavior that benefits counsel more than clients. We
then situate multidistrict litigation within the rich literature on
other complex adaptive systems and use those core insights to
suggest that future reformers would do well to consider how
network connectivity affects their efforts to provoke systemic
change.
A. Repeat Players’ Impact
To begin to gauge repeat players’ impact, we obtained and
analyzed the thirteen publicly available, private nonclass set-
tlements that occurred in ten multidistrict litigations within
our dataset, which collectively covered 64,107 actions. In ex-
amining those settlements, we looked for four types of provi-
sions:  (1)  those  that  generate  closure  (attorney-
recommendation, attorney-withdrawal, walkaway, and case-
census provisions); (2) those where lead lawyers negotiate some
aspect of their fees with a defendant either directly or through
the settlement; (3) those that reduced awards to latecomers;
and (4) those that allowed the money remaining in the settle-
ment fund to revert to defendants. Closure, latecomer, and
reversion provisions benefit defendants, while common-benefit
fee provisions reward lead plaintiffs’ lawyers. When courts and
the parties made the claims-filing data public, which was rare,
we considered that information as well.280
As evidenced previously in Table 6, we found that at least
one of our top five repeat players (based on degree centrality)
participated directly in each settled litigation’s leadership. The
Propulsid settlement designers noted they were creating a tem-
plate for settlement, and they were correct. Every nonclass
settlement in our database after it contained some of its fea-
tures and at least one closure-related provision to help end the
lawsuits.
280 For an overview of what little information was available, see Burch, Monop-
olies, supra note 71, at 131–32, Table 3. R\\jciprod01\productn\C\CRN\102-6\CRN602.txt unknown Seq: 75 29-SEP-17 12:56

FIGURE 9: SUMMARY OF PROVISIONS IN THE THIRTEEN
EXAMINED SETTLEMENTS
Each  settlement  uniformly  departed  from  conventional
deals between plaintiffs and defendants, shifting the deal-mak-
ing entities to lead lawyers and defendants, and then requiring
individual attorneys to either become additional signatories or
recommend the deal to all of their clients if one client wanted to
settle. Additionally, as Figure 9 illustrates, every settlement
permitted the defendant to walk away from its funding obliga-
tions if too few claimants abandoned their right to sue in the
judicial system in favor of the settlement’s claims-administra-
tion process. Combined, these changes tied plaintiffs’ attor-
neys’ financial self-interest to each other, for none of them
would receive fees if too few claimants accepted the settlement
offer. Also like Propulsid, two settlements took the added step\\jciprod01\productn\C\CRN\102-6\CRN602.txt unknown Seq: 76 29-SEP-17 12:56
1520 CORNELL LAW REVIEW [Vol.102:1445
of explicitly requiring attorneys to withdraw from representing
clients who refused to settle.
Common-benefit  fee  and  settlement-fund  distribution
practices were remarkably similar, with plaintiffs’ leadership
often negotiating a fee increase for themselves at the end of a
proceeding. Moreover, in two of the eleven litigations, Propulsid
and Biomet, lead lawyers negotiated their fees directly with the
defendant, such that the fees were not apportioned from the
common fund (in accordance with a restitution theory),281 but
from the defendant’s coffers. In six other litigations—Vioxx,
Yasmin/Yaz, DePuy ASR, Fosamax, Actos, and Zimmer Durom
Hip Cup—lead lawyers included some aspect of their common-
benefit fee within the settlement, which meant negotiating their
compensation with the defendant. Bargaining over attorneys’
fees with one’s opponent—even if subject to court approval—is
a unilateral move away from contingent fees, which are de-
signed to tie the fates of lawyer and client by increasing fees in
proportion with a client’s actual recovery.
Finally,  both  DePuy  ASR  settlements  and  the  Zimmer
Durom Hip Cup settlement contained latecomer reductions,
which help defendants by discouraging attorney advertising
and reducing payouts. And two litigations (each producing two
settlements)—Propulsid and DePuy ASR—included provisions
in which all or part of the remaining settlement funds reverted
to the defendants. In DePuy ASR, the reversion clause worked
in concert with the settlement’s practice of reducing payouts to
latecomers since those funds reverted to the defendant.
In sum, we found robust empirical evidence of repeat-
player attorneys on both the plaintiff and defense side as well
as a multidistrict-litigation leadership network that contains a
strong, cohesive center. The lack of formal rules in multidis-
trict  proceedings  allows  these  repeat  players  to  shape  the
methods for selecting and compensating leadership, and the
lack of formal judicial oversight in nonclass settlements affords
repeat players considerable latitude in settlement design.
Based on the limited nonclass settlements available to us,
we found reason to be concerned that when repeat players
influence the practices and norms that govern multidistrict
proceedings—when  they  “play  for  rules,”  so  to  speak—the
practices they develop, cite, and replicate may principally bene-
fit them at one-shot plaintiffs’ expense. While we were often

unable to obtain claims-rate or payout information that was
filed under seal or kept private, many of the settlement provi-
sions appear to enrich lead plaintiffs’ lawyers and the defend-
ants  with  whom  they  broker  the  deal—not  one-shot
plaintiffs.282 If claims-administration data were available, it
could provide a more complete and robust picture of the benefit
these practices confer on claimants.
Given the data available to us, however, over a twenty-two-
year span, we were unable to find any publicly available non-
class settlement that did not feature at least one closure provi-
sion (which benefits the defendant). And, excepting NuvaRing,
where the transferee court taxed settling state-court plaintiffs
directly,283 and American Medical Systems, where fees were not
available, each settlement likewise contained some provision
that increased lead lawyers’ fees. While one could argue that
we cannot claim causation with such evidence (and to be fair,
we are not trying to do so), the mere fact that the same play-
ers appear in the vast majority of these cases, resulting in
remarkably similar settlements that benefit the people design-
ing  them  merits  concern  and  warrants  further  empirical
investigation.284
B. Implications for Leverage, Ethics, and Collusion
A highly concentrated plaintiff and defense bar is nothing
new, nor is the disquiet about where that concentration may
lead. As scholars have long recognized, repeat play tends to
regress our adversarial system from its confrontational roots
toward a state of cooperation.285 In the criminal context, pros-
ecutors and public defenders routinely work together through
plea bargaining, leading them toward mutual accommodation;
incumbents form a primary community of interest, whereas
282 Anecdotal evidence is rife with mistrust of the deals these lawyers create.
See, e.g.,Barry Meier, Frustration from a Deal on Flawed Hip Implants, N.Y. TIMES,
Nov. 25, 2013, at B1 (“But some patients contend that the deal’s real winners are
Johnson & Johnson and the plaintiffs’ lawyers. Those lawyers are set to receive
about one-third of the settlement, or about $800 million. The single biggest
chunk of those fees will go to the firms most involved with developing cases
against Johnson & Johnson and negotiating the settlement; they will get a bonus
of about $160 million.”).

clients present secondary challenges and contingencies.286 As
such, adversary features are often overshadowed by regulars’
quid pro quo needs.287 As Professor Jerome Skolnick has ex-
plained, those working group relationships become a social
control problem only once they reach a “tipping point where
cooperation may shade off into collusion, thereby subverting
the ethical basis of the system.”288
In 1995, Professor John Coffee lamented in the class con-
text, “[t]hese circumstances supply the preconditions for collu-
sion  between  defendants  and  a  favored  plaintiffs’  counsel:
repeat players, a single forum in which the court is eager to
achieve a global settlement, and ‘passive’ future claimants.”289
He went on to distinguish between “old” collusion, where there
is an actual or implicit agreement in which defendants settle
cheaply in exchange for higher plaintiffs’ attorneys fees,290 and
“new” collusion through inventory settlements as side deals to
a settlement class, double-dipping by serving as both class
counsel and individual counsel for opt-outs, and striking deals
that restrict claimants’ eligibility through rigorous claims crite-
ria.291 Some of these scenarios resonate with the settlements
examined,  such  as  Propulsid’s  claims  process,  reversion
clauses, and direct fee negotiation; Biomet’s direct fee agree-
ment with the defendant and potentially doubled attorneys’
fees; DePuy ASR’s reversion clause; and both DePuy ASR and
Zimmer Durom Hip Cup’s reductions for nonclient, unrepre-

clients  more  than  class  members—a  practice  the  Supreme
Court struck down in Amchem Products, Inc. v. Windsor and
Ortiz v. Fibreboard Corp.292
Of course, there are some important distinctions between
class and nonclass aggregation: nonclass aggregation cannot
bind those not before the court as a class action can. Because
plaintiffs are present and have filed suit, conventional thinking
suggests that plaintiffs’ consent to settle is enough; there is no
need to layer in judicial supervision as there is when absent

class members’ rights are at stake. But our findings suggest
that attorneys’ financial interests may muddy plaintiffs’ con-
sent since clients typically follow their attorney’s advice.293
Lawyers’ finances may be intertwined with each other not only
through settlement provisions that condition the deal (and at-
torneys’ fees) on achieving a certain plaintiff participation rate,
but also through formal joint venture agreements and informal
promises to distribute common-benefit work and leadership
positions to allies. Longstanding principal-agent research sug-
gests that agents’ financial self-interest may color their advice
to clients.294 Just as they do in the class action and criminal
context, repeat players face systemic temptations to be more
loyal to each other or even to defendants, than to their own
clients.295
Individual plaintiffs’ attorneys’ lack of litigation leverage
and power may compound these temptations. Ordinarily, even
an out-gunned and out-manned plaintiffs’ lawyer squaring off
against a well-heeled defendant can threaten to take a case to
trial on a shoestring budget. But multidistrict litigation takes
away that bargaining chip for all but a handful of bellwether
cases; transferee judges rarely remand cases for trial.296 When
combined with plaintiffs’ attorneys’ interlaced financial inter-
ests and a tightly connected social network, that lack of lever-
age against defendants turns into a lack of power for individual
attorneys who might otherwise act as a check on questionable
settlement practices.
Repeat players’ relationships with one another may like-
wise play a critical role in creating social norms and perpetuat-
ing practices that push ethical boundaries. Regular interaction
could lead plaintiffs’ attorneys to have stronger social and rela-
tional ties to each other than to one-time clients, and could
prompt them to identify as a group.297 Groups tend to catalyze

can turn into an accepted practice.305 Put simply, unethical
behavior,  particularly  among  in-group  members,  can  be
contagious.306
In-groups comprised of highly connected actors likewise
tend to police themselves internally through social and finan-
cial  sanctions.307  As  the  social  network  illustrates,  repeat
players form dyadic relationships to others, which not only
allows knowledge of common settlement practices to flow freely
among them, but also information about cooperative and unco-
operative behaviors, and attorneys’ reputations as collabora-
tors, contrarians, or defectors. The easy flow of information
may enable leaders to credibly punish and reward others for
following or disregarding norms, which decreases the likeli-
hood that information about tacit or explicit collusion would
surface or that members would raise ethical concerns about
settlement practices on their client’s behalf.308 Our anecdotal
evidence bears this out. In-group attorneys spoke with us
freely only on the condition of anonymity, for defecting in one
proceeding could prompt financial repercussions in concurrent
and future proceedings. After all, when judges defer to attor-
neys to pick their own leaders through the consensus method
and appoint lead lawyers to serve on fee-allocation committees,
they can give repeat players substantial enforcement tools.
This leaves us with a new variant on the timeless principal-
agent concern that, without monitoring, agents may disserve
their principals to benefit themselves: lead lawyers as agents
may disserve out-group principals with whom they seldom in-
teract to immediately benefit lead lawyers’ collective interests

and to better their own, individual interests over time.309 At-
torneys on the social network’s periphery might further their
own interests by cooperating with questionable practices; this
could earn them trust from the current group leaders and posi-
tion them for future leadership roles as well as the lucrative
common-benefit fees that accompany them. It likewise adds
insight into the path dependencies that led to Professor Coffee’s
conclusion that “[o]nce bent, legal rules tend to stay bent.”310
Questionable practices may be entrenched and replicated not
only  because  they  benefit  repeat  actors,  but  because  they
might be woven into the legal, social, and ethical culture.
C. Implications for Law Reform
Stepping back and looking more broadly at the social net-
work suggests that the behaviors of controlling stakeholders—
plaintiffs’ attorneys, defense attorneys, defendants, and even
judges—cannot be understood in isolation. As social norms so
aptly illustrate, each agent adjusts to feedback from a variety of
sources and circumstances such as Rule 23’s absence, judicial
selection criteria, agents’ needs, parties’ desires, ethical cul-
tures, legislation, and of course the underlying facts and law.
Agents adapt.311 As the evolution of Propulsid’s settlement pro-
visions  demonstrate,  new  practices  emerge  from  past  suc-
cesses and failures. Dissecting the discrete settlements that
repeat actors design and viewing them in the aggregate allows
us to identify emergent properties and trends.312
Understanding how these agents interact, change, and ac-
climate—what, in other words, makes multidistrict litigation
complex—can help us formulate more realistic and useful pro-
positions about how we might improve the system. Of course,
some existing theories already explain basic interactions. For
instance,  the  prisoner’s  dilemma—where  players  decide
whether to cooperate with one another by staying silent or to
defect by giving the other player up in return for a shorter
sentence—helps us understand bilateral, strategic interactions
309 See Blumberg, supra note 286, at 24 (“Close and continuing relations R
between the lawyer ‘regular’ and his former colleagues in the prosecutor’s office
generally overshadow the relationship between the regular and his client.”).

2017] REPEAT PLAYERS IN MULTIDISTRICT LITIGATION 1527
without much complexity.313 Likewise, tit-for-tat strategies in
repeated situations—where players cooperate upon first inter-
acting with someone, but retaliate when cooperation is not re-
ciprocated—can  help  us  understand  how  interconnected
repeat players may profit more financially over time by working
together than objecting to questionable practices.314 It can
also shed light on why a one-shotter attorney may be better off
defecting (by objecting when excluded from leadership or not
cooperating when the usual practices diverge from her client’s
best interest, for example) unless she hopes to become a repeat
player.315
But these traditional analytic tools tend to break down
when many people interact—multiple claimants, attorneys, de-
fendants, judges, rules committees, and legislatures.316 It is
the difference between tic-tac-toe and chess.317 Unlike conven-
tional tools, complex adaptive systems theory, the theory that
underpins  social  network  analysis,  allows  us  to  consider
agents’ interconnectivity.
Characterizing multidistrict litigation as a complex adap-
tive system alongside things like cities, stock markets, and
grasslands provides a way to explore the complexity and adap-
tivity inherent in those proceedings.318 Across the board, these
systems share characteristics that are not perfectly patterned,
completely random, or entirely chaotic. Instead, they include
sophisticated agents who evolve to capitalize on changing cir-
cumstances, and act strategically in ways that are sometimes
rational and sometimes not.319 Like other complex adaptive
systems, multidistrict proceedings include diverse, connected,
interdependent, networked agents that interact repeatedly and

generate adaptive outcomes that cannot be isolated into their
component  parts.320  The  patterns  that  emerge  are  neither
completely ordered nor totally arbitrary. Plaintiffs’ lawyers do
not randomly pair with one another to form coalitions (as mod-
els for considering the spread of disease often assume), nor
does everyone within the plaintiffs’ bar interact simultaneously
with everyone else (like political models often suppose).
Complexity arises when agents like repeat players depend
on  each  other  and  that  dependence  spurs  system-wide  ef-
fects.321 Take grasslands, for example. The species in that
environment interact in many different ways, which builds net-
work connectivity. Substituting one agent, say a “sit-and-wait”
spider (or an experienced but less centrally networked attor-
ney) with an “active hunting” spider (a central repeat player)
can set off a chain reaction: to avoid becoming the active spi-
der’s prey, grasshoppers change their feeding strategy, which
likewise alters vegetation.322 Agents adapt through feedback
and produce effects beyond their bilateral interactions. Once
active hunting spiders infiltrate an area as repeat players have
done in multidistrict leadership, they may create a pattern that
makes inroads by sit-and-wait spiders increasingly difficult,
thereby establishing “path dependence.”323
Path dependence isn’t limited to grasslands and spiders.
When Congress passed the Private Securities Litigation Reform
Act (PSLRA), for example, it aimed to reform and dislodge class-
action lawyers—Milberg Weiss, in particular—by creating a
presumption that the most adequate plaintiff is the one with
the largest financial interest.324 Congress’s hope was that this
would instill a sophisticated, incentivized entity to monitor
plaintiffs’ lawyers. But rather than displacing large plaintiffs’
firms, the PSLRA entrenched them;325 one study published
eight years after PSLRA’s enactment showed Milberg Weiss as
lead or co-lead counsel in over 50% of the cases.326 Why? To
gain institutional clients with the biggest stakes, the plaintiffs’

bar had to spend significant resources to advertise, effectively
boxing smaller firms out of the market.327 In short, the PSLRA
actually benefitted larger, moneyed plaintiffs’ firms like Milberg
Weiss,  created  a  concentrated  bar,  and  established  path
dependence.
Likewise, when transferee judges use experience, coopera-
tive tendencies, and an ability to finance the litigation as pri-
mary factors in selecting lead lawyers in multidistrict litigation,
they entrench repeat players in leadership roles. But path de-
pendence is not path permanence. Just as the active hunting
spider might be “locked in” for now, another key feature of the
complex adaptive system is “stable disequilibrium.”328 Change
can constantly occur. If sit-and-wait spiders are less suscepti-
ble to harsh winters than the active hunting spider, then a
particularly  cold  winter  might  prompt  conditions  ripe  for
change.329 Similarly, if non-repeat players faithfully defend
their clients’ best interests against their own self-interest and
the self-interest of lead lawyers, then ethical clarifications and
external measures that promote competition might provoke
change, too. External adjustments such as the passage of the
Class Action Fairness Act can upset the balance in complex
litigation as well.330 Nevertheless, because of agents’ adaptiv-
ity,  most  change  is  incremental—not  dramatic;  entrenched
agents are resilient, as the PSLRA example illustrates.
What then can we learn from situating multidistrict litiga-
tion as a complex adaptive system? First, drawing from its rich
interdisciplinary literature, its core ideas, and its metaphors
allows us make more realistic assumptions about the social
activity, information, and behaviors that are likely to occur
within multidistrict litigation’s social network.331 There are
certain patterns that emerge and hold true across all complex
adaptive systems—ecosystems, political elections, and econo-
mies, for instance. Here are two: (1) diversity typically en-
hances  complex  systems’  functionality  and  contributes  to
innovation and productivity; and (2) complex systems need

competition  to  flourish  and  diversity  drives  competition.332
When the same actors work together repeatedly, their thinking
tends to converge, and emphasizing cooperation can dampen
competition that might otherwise serve to safeguard plaintiffs’
best interests.333
Second, using social network analysis to map connections
between agents in multidistrict litigation reveals links that can-
not be seen by the naked eye. Those connections allow us to
develop some working hypotheses about the level of repeat play
and the kind of social interactions that might occur when
agents encounter one another in well-defined networks. Con-
sider three such possibilities. First, when attorneys become
lead lawyers, they and their allies have the power to distribute
common-benefit work, suggest fee allocations, and report un-
cooperative behavior to the judge—carrots and sticks, in other
words.334 Second, judicial focus on experience, financial re-
sources, and cooperation means that lead attorneys not only
possess power in the current litigation, but will almost always
have concurrent and future leadership opportunities to credi-
bly punish or reward other attorneys. Finally, unlike game-
theoretic computer exercises, repeat players likely have inside
information about past behaviors and transactions through di-
rect knowledge, gossip, and news reports. In short, reciprocity
and reputation may prove integral to this close-knit group of
lawyers: they may share information easily through their net-
work, exercise power in future litigations, and credibly sanc-
tion  and  reward  one  another  for  following  or  disregarding
norms that promote their collective interests.
Third, from there we can diagnose probable systemic dys-
functions. Multidistrict litigation is designed to promote pre-

trial  efficiency  and  consistency  without  altering  core  due
process rights such as adequate representation and the right to
have one’s day in court. But settlements with provisions that
principally benefit the attorneys or the defendant at the plain-
tiffs’ expense might indicate that efficiency has trumped ade-
quate representation.335 Recalibration may be in order.
Fourth, we can recognize the limited capacity to dramati-
cally change the status quo and instead propose malleable
methods that work with—not against—the inertia of a complex
adaptive system. While federal rules committees and legisla-
tures may seek changes that provoke paradigm shifts,336 the
reality is that attorneys in this elite bar are adaptive, resilient,
and likely to withstand these adjustments. Thus, the broader
lesson is that enhancing functionality within multidistrict liti-
gation may not hinge on top-down or external legislative re-
forms,  but  in  harnessing  an  equally  adaptive  power  that
already lies within the system itself: competition.337 As the
vast literature on collateral attacks in the class-action context
illustrates, the plaintiffs’ bar is highly competitive.338 But judi-
cial selection methods and deference to repeat players may
have muted open rivalry by encouraging and rewarding cooper-
ation. Interconnected agents who benefit from the status quo
are more likely to shun and ostracize objectors who threaten to
disrupt their practices—particularly if that objection could de-
rail a lucrative settlement. Consequently, the question going
forward becomes how to tweak norms and design adjustments
that  capitalize  on  pre-existing  competitive  forces  such  that
faithfully representing plaintiffs’ interests becomes more lucra-
tive than playing the long game.339
335 For an argument as to why Due Process protections of adequate represen-
tation should extend to nonclass multidistrict litigation in ways that are similar to
class actions, see Burch, supra note 71, at 158–61, 179. R
336 E.g.,Class Action Fairness Act of 2005 §§2(a), (b), Pub. L. No. 109-2, 119
Stat. 4, 5 (codified in scattered sections of 28 U.S.C.); Advisory Committee on Civil
Rules, Washington D.C., Apr. 9–10, 2015, at 39–41, available at http://www

CV2015-04.pdf [https://perma.cc/T77P-4JU2]; Jeffrey D. Koelemay, Bill to Curb
Class Suits Clears Committee; Civil Rights Plaintiffs Thrown a Bone, 16 BNA CLASS
ACTION RPT. 718 (June 24, 2015).
337 For proposed reforms based on competition, see Burch, supra note 71, at R
168–85.

quate Representation in Class Suits, 79 TEX. L. REV. 383, 384–87 (2000).
