MDL v. TRUMP: THE PUZZLE OF PUBLIC LAW IN
MULTIDISTRICT  LITIGATIONt
Andrew D. Bradt & Zachary D. Clopton
ABSTRACT-Litigation against the Trump Administration has proliferated
rapidly since the inauguration. As cases challenging executive actions, such
as  the  "travel  ban,"  multiply  in  federal  courts  around  the  country,  an
important  procedural  question  has  so  far  not  been  considered-Should
these sets of cases be consolidated in a single court under the Multidistrict
Litigation Act?  Multidistrict  litigation,  or  MDL,  has  become  one  of the
most prominent parts of federal litigation and offers substantial benefits by
coordinating  litigation pending in geographically  dispersed federal  courts.
Arguably,  those benefits  would  also  accrue  if "public  law"  cases  were
given  MDL  treatment.  There  also  are  some  underappreciated  strategic
reasons why both plaintiffs and the government might want to invoke the
MDL process in these cases-and we suspect that, sooner rather than later,
one of these parties might give MDL a try.
In this Essay, we argue that although the MDL statute would allow for
consolidation  of these public  law cases, there  are prudential reasons why
the judges  in charge of MDL should stay their hands. In our view, these
cases rarely achieve the efficiencies of most MDLs,  and there is value to
these cases undergoing scrutiny in multiple trial and appellate courts before
they percolate upward to Supreme  Court review. Moreover, consolidation
of these cases would raise the political profile of the MDL process and thus
might politicize the MDL itself as well as the selection of its judges.  This
politicization  could  undermine  MDL's  primary  role  in  mass  tort
litigation-and,  indeed,  it  risks  harming  the  national  tort  system  more
generally.

INTRODUCTION
While running  for the presidency,  Donald Trump  campaigned  on a
platform promising jobs to the American people.I So far, however, perhaps
his biggest success  on that score has been creating work for lawyers  suing
him  and  his  Administration.2  Lawsuits  challenging  the  new  President's
actions have proliferated throughout the federal courts, including the high-
profile suits contesting the "travel ban" Executive Order,3 contending that
the President's business entanglements  violate the Emoluments  Clauses of
the Constitution,4 and asserting that his plan to punish so-called "sanctuary
cities" is unconstitutional.5
The travel ban litigation, in particular, has been notable  for its speed
and multiplicity. Almost immediately after the ban was announced, lawyers

fanned  out  across  the  country  both to  aid  affected  individuals  and  to
challenge the order in multiple federal courts.6 What resulted was a panoply
of  rulings  and  overlapping  injunctions,  followed  by  several  appellate
decisions  and, inevitably,  cert. petitions  and Supreme  Court review.7  As
these  cases wended  their way  through various  federal  courts  around the
country,  a  question  occurred to  us, as procedure  scholars-Why  haven't
these cases-and the other sets of cases challenging the Administration-
been made the subject of multidistrict litigation (MDL)? And, if they were,
would that be preferable to the free-for-all of the status quo?
The  MDL  statute,  28 U.S.C.  § 1407,  allows  for  consolidation  of
pretrial  proceedings  in  a  single  federal  district  of all  cases  sharing  a
common question of fact. Any party to any of the allegedly related cases
may make  a motion for consolidation.'  This motion triggers consideration
by the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation (JPML, or the Panel), the
panel  of  seven  federal  judges  that  decides  whether  cases  should  be
consolidated into MDL and where the MDL should be assigned.9 The MDL
statute's  goal  is  to  prevent  duplication  of similar  litigation  in  multiple
federal courts across the country. The basic idea is that it is more efficient
to conduct pretrial proceedings  in cases involving the same questions only
one time and before only one judge, rather than over and over again before
many.
For many years,  the  1968 MDL statute was relatively  little noticed,
even by most procedure  scholars,10 but that is emphatically  no longer the
case. Quite the opposite is true: MDL is now in the spotlight, if for no other
reason than the surprising statistic that MDL cases currently make up more
than one-third of the pending federal civil docket, an astonishing increase
over the last two decades.II  Over the last few years, it has become accepted
wisdom  that  virtually  any  tort  controversy  of  national  import  will
inevitably become an MDL proceeding consolidated before a single judge.

Examples  include  the BP  oil spill, the Volkswagen  "clean  diesel"  fraud,
and  the  NFL  concussion  litigation,  all  of which  were  "MDL-ed"  and
assigned  by  the  JPML  to  handpicked  judges  in  New  Orleans,  San
Francisco,  and  Philadelphia,  respectively.12  And  all  have  been  resolved
relatively  successfully  through massive  settlements,  though not  without
hiccups. In short, MDL is now a central and mostly well-regarded aspect of
the  federal  legal  system  when  it  comes  to  litigation  of national  scope,
largely  because  it  facilitates  a  unitary,  nationwide  proceeding  and,
potentially, a global settlement.
While it is true that MDL is best known for consolidating mass torts, it
is not confined to those cases. The small group of judges who  developed
the  MDL  statute wanted  it  to  be  as  open-ended  as  possible,  so  that  its
application would not be limited to particular subject matters.13 As a result,
there is no language in the statute preventing the MDL device  from being
deployed in what we might think of as "public law"  cases,14 such as those
pending  against  the  Trump  Administration.  There  also  are  some  good
reasons  why  participants  in these cases-and  the judges hearing  them-
might find MDL attractive. For one thing, the same sort of efficiencies that
motivate a typical MDL may  exist in public law cases-Why  litigate the
same question, take the same  discovery, and file the same briefs multiple
times when one will do, particularly in cases that are destined for Supreme
Court review? Although MDL is best known as a mass tort mechanism, it
is not difficult  to imagine how  its benefits  might translate to  public law
cases.
Moreover, parties  on either side of the "v" might see MDL as a way
out of a courtroom  they find unfriendly.  That  is, should  a lawyer not be
satisfied with the luck of the draw in any particular district, she might roll
the dice with the JPML in hopes of getting a preferable judicial assignment.
The  possibility of getting a more  favorable draw  from the JPML may be
especially tempting for plaintiffs  if they  expect,  rightly  or wrongly,  that
they will get more favorable treatment from a JPML dominated, six to one,
by Clinton appointees.

proposal intended to apply broadly to all litigation pending in multiple districts,  including 'contract,
fraud, negligence, antitrust, and civil rights').

Given the opportunities that MDL consolidation offers, we expect that
it will not be long before  some party  dissatisfied with a random judicial
assignment will take a crack at MDL consolidation in a public law case. In
this  Essay,  we  hope  to  provide  some  perspective  about  whether  such
consolidation is consistent with the purposes of the MDL statute, preferable
as  a matter of procedural policy,  and desirable  as a matter of procedural
politics.  In  other words-May  these  cases  be sent  to  MDL,  and,  if  so,
should they be?
In brief, we argue that, while MDL treatment of these cases would be
permissible under the terms of the statute, the JPML should usually avoid
consolidation of public law cases for two sets of reasons. First, we think the
traditional arguments for consolidation based on efficiency and consistency
are weakened in these  cases and, to the contrary, there is some benefit to
percolation of these issues in multiple district courts. Moreover, in most of
these  cases,  the major  disputes  likely involve  questions  of statutory  and
constitutional  interpretation  to  be  resolved  on motions  for  preliminary
injunction or motions to dismiss, not after lengthy discovery or after trials
to resolve disputes of material fact. As a result, in these cases,  one of the
primary  benefits  of  MDL-the  ability  to  minimize  expensive,  time-
consuming, and potentially duplicative discovery-is less important.
The second reason to avoid use of MDL in the public law context is
that there is real  danger in politicizing  the panel by involving it in these
sorts of cases. Introducing litigation like the travel ban cases would enmesh
the JPML in selecting the judge who will write the district court  opinion
resolving the matter,  likely  on a motion for preliminary  injunction. That
assignment  decision will be both fraught  and well publicized,  and it may
risk the credibility of the panel in all of its judicial assignments. Moreover,
this  new  role  may  create  an  incentive  for  the  Chief  Justice,  who  has
unfettered  statutory  discretion  to  appoint  the members  of the  JPML, to
stack the committee with philosophical fellow travelers-an allegation that
has been  leveled  against the  Chief Justice's  more politically  noteworthy
assignments.15
In this  Essay, we  will  first briefly  introduce  MDL,  where it  came
from, and how it works. We will then discuss why it might appear to be an
appealing  option  in  public  law  litigation.  After  giving  those  potential
benefits  serious  consideration,  we  then turn to  explaining  why  in  most
cases we believe that the JPML should presumptively refuse to consolidate
these cases, on the ground that the risks outweigh the benefits.

I.  MDL BACKGROUND
For a long time, multidistrict litigation flew  under the radar. It  was
perceived as a wonkish, technical procedural  device designed to coordinate
discovery in related cases.16 All that has changed:  MDL has gone from bit
part in the federal litigation scheme to a starring role, at least in the context
of mass torts.17
In order to understand MDL's current prominence,  it is necessary  to
understand the statute's origins and the power it grants to the Judicial Panel
on Multidistrict Litigation and transferee judges. Although its roots go back
even further, the proximate progenitor of the MDL statute was the massive
civil antitrust  litigation that arose  from  revelations  of price-fixing  in the
electrical-equipment  industry.18  That  scandal-unprecedented  in  its  size
and scope-threatened to overwhelm the federal  courts with thousands  of
complex  and  resource-consuming  cases.19  In  an  attempt  to  mitigate  the
threat posed by the deluge of litigation, Chief Justice Earl Warren created a
Judicial  Conference  committee  called  the  Coordinating  Committee  on
Multiple Litigation. The Committee, initially chaired by Chief Judge Alfred
P. Murrah of the Tenth Circuit, was composed of nine federal judges, all of
whom were assigned at least one of the electrical-equipment cases and who
had  previously  demonstrated  their  enthusiasm  for  the  then-novel  but
burgeoning concept ofjudicial management.2
The Coordinating Committee had no formal power, but its goal was to
encourage  cooperation  between  the  federal  judges  and  parties  to  the
litigation scattered  around the country. Perhaps because  of the scale of the
nationwide  litigation,  there  was  almost  complete  cooperation  by  all
involved.21   Ultimately,  the  Committee's  efforts  were  remarkably

matters.").

PROCEEDINGS  OF THE  TWENTY-EIGHTH ANNUAL  JUDICIAL CONFERENCE  OF THE THIRD  JUDICIAL
CIRCUIT OF THE UNITED  STATES,  39 F.R.D.  375,  515  (1965)  (statement of Judge  Thomas  Clary)
(describing the nationwide civil antitrust actions as an "avalanche").
20  See Bradt, supra note 13, at 852  53, 860-61.
21 Among other innovations, the Coordinating Committee made use of nationwide conferences and
depositions, uniform national pretrial orders, and national document depositories to streamline pretrial
proceedings. See Phil C.  Neal & Perry Goldberg, The Electrical Equipment Antitrust Cases: Novel
Judicial Administration, 50 A.B.A.  J.  621  (1964);  see also MANUAL  FOR  COMPLEX AND  MULTI-
DISTRICT LITIGATION 6 (1969)  ("If it had not been for the monumental effort of the nine judges on this112:905 (2018) MDL v. Trump
successful:  although  at  least  some  of the  defendants  felt  railroaded  to
settlement by the pace of the litigation, it succeeded in its efforts to resolve
the entirety of the litigation quickly22
The legacy of the Coordinating Committee goes beyond the electrical-
equipment suits. While those cases were ongoing, the Committee-with the
backing  of Chief Justice Warren and the Judicial  Conference-turned  its
attention to  creating  a permanent  mechanism  for  consolidating  litigation
pending in multiple districts around the country. The two primary drafters
of the statute, Coordinating Committee member  Judge William H. Becker
and reporter Phil C. Neal of the University of Chicago Law School, had the
insight that the kind of cooperation  exhibited in the electrical-equipment
cases  would  be  unlikely  to  recur,  in  large  part because  of defendants'
dissatisfaction  with  aggregated  proceedings  and  federal  judges'  chafing
under  the  control  exercised  by  the  Committee.  As  a result,  in  cases  of
national import, the power of the federal courts needed to be centralized in
the hands of a single judge, and preferably one committed to the principles
of active case management.23 Indeed, as Judge Becker memorably put it, a
single judge must be in control of the pace of discovery and other pretrial
proceedings, or else the "litigants would run cases. '24 The ultimate result of
Neal  and Becker's efforts,  the details of which  are chronicled  elsewhere,
was the MDL statute, passed by Congress without a single dissenting vote
in 1968.25
The statute itself is relatively barebones. It provides that "[w]hen  civil
actions  involving  one or more  common questions  of fact are pending in
different  districts,  such  actions  may  be  transferred  to  any  district  for
coordinated  or consolidated pretrial proceedings"  by the Judicial Panel on
Multidistrict  Litigation,  a panel  of seven  federal judges  selected  by  the
Chief Justice.26 The  statute provides that consolidation should be "for  the
convenience  of parties and witnesses"  and "promote the just and efficient
conduct of such actions."27 Either the JPML on its own motion or any party
Committee of the Judicial Conference and the remarkable cooperation of the 35 district judges before
whom these cases were pending, the district court calendars throughout the country could well have
broken down."  (quoting Earl Warren,  Chief Justice,  U.S.  Supreme Court, Address to  the Annual
Meeting of the American Law Institute (May 16, 1967))).

in any pending case may move for consolidation2.8 Decisions about whether
cases will be consolidated,  and where they will be transferred,  are to be
made by the JPML.9 At the conclusion of pretrial proceedings,  the cases
are to be remanded to the districts where they were filed for trial3. 0
There  are  almost no  real  limits  on the  JPML's  discretion  when  it
comes  to  the  all-important  conclusions  about  whether  cases  should  be
consolidated into an MDL and to whom the MDL will be assigned. For one
thing,  the  statute  applies  anytime  there  are  civil  actions  involving  a
common  question  of  fact  pending  in  multiple  districts-there  is  no
limitation as to subject matter.  This was important to the drafters of the
statute, who perceived a coming "litigation explosion"  arising out of new
technology, population growth, and expanded rights of action.2  Traditional
limitations on venue and personal jurisdiction also have been thought not to
apply  to  MDL.3  The  only  real  barrier  to  the  MDL's  selection  of a
transferee judge is that both the proposed MDL judge and the chief judge
of  her  district  must  consent  to  the  assignment. 4  But  none  of  these
limitations on the JPML's discretion are practically enforceable because the
statute provides that review of an order  of the panel may be had only by

extraordinary writ.35 In the first fifty years of the JPML's existence, such a
writ has never been granted.6
Moreover,  the  seemingly  important  limit  of  MDLs  to  "pretrial
proceedings"  has proved  illusory-or, at least,  overstated.  It is true that,
under the  statute,  "[e]ach  action  so transferred  shall be remanded  by  the
panel at or before the conclusion of such pretrial proceedings to the district
from  which  it  was  transferred." 37  But  that  command  comes  with  an
important  condition:  "unless  it  shall have been  previously terminated."38
Previously terminated cases include those decided on dispositive motion or
settled. Most readers  will no doubt be familiar with the vanishing trial in
American  civil litigation,  whereby  barely  any civil  cases  make it all  the
way to trial, instead  ending after summary judgment or settlement.9  That
same trend extends to MDL. Virtually all consolidated cases are resolved in
the MDL district without any substantive contribution from the originating
courts.40 As a result, many MDL decisions are insulated from both appellate
review and review by other district judges.
Although the MDL statute has not changed since  it was passed fifty
years  ago,  its  prominence  has  expanded  rapidly  during the  last  fifteen
years.41 Now with nearly 40%  of the pending federal civil cases as part of
an MDL,42 the MDL process is impossible to ignore.43  Today, it is nearly a
15  Id. § 1407(e). The JPML's decision not to consolidate cases is not subject to appellate review.

is in large respect insulated from both appellate review and the meddling of rulemakers, as are MDL
judges who have wide discretion to manage cases to resolution. See Andrew D. Bradt, The Stickiness of
the MDL Statute, REV. LITIG. (forthcoming 2018).

40 The Administrative Office of U.S. Courts reported the following about MDL cases:
Since its creation in 1968, the Panel has centralized 593,711 civil actions for pretrial proceedings.
By the end of fiscal year 2016, a total of 16,221 actions had been remanded for trial, 398 actions
had been reassigned within the transferee districts, 440,174  actions had been terminated  in the
transferee courts, and 136,918 actions were pending throughout 55 transferee district courts.

foregone  conclusion that mass tort litigation will be considered  for MDL
treatment,44 and indeed  the major tort controversies  of recent  years have
found themselves in front of MDL judges.45 And to the extent that we limit
ourselves  to the  goals  of the  statute's  drafters-centralized  control  over
dispersed  litigation-MDL has been  a massive success  because it creates
ideal conditions  for resolution:  a single  decisionmaker who  can gather all
involved parties in a single courtroom4t.
II.  MDL'S PUBLIC LAW PUZZLE
Given  its  open-ended  mandate,  MDL  is a  conceivable  vehicle  for
public law cases that share a common question of fact. On rare occasion, a
public law-like case has reached the JPML. The panel consolidated  some
9/1 1-related  litigation,47  the  BP  oil  spill  Cases,4   various  suits  against
telecommunications  providers  that  allegedly  participated  in  NSA
surveillance,49  and the  occasional  administrative  law dispute.  But these
43 What explains MDL's emergence? Most scholars peg the recent growth of MDL to the decline in
availability of the mass tort class action. See, e.g., Margaret S. Thomas, Morphing Case Boundaries in
Multidistrict Litigation Settlements, 63 EMORY  L.J.  1339,  1346 (2014)  ("As reliance  on Rule  23
diminished, MDL has ascended as  the most important federal procedural device to aggregate (and
settle) mass torts.").

increase in MDL aggregate litigation").
45 See supra note 12 and accompanying text.
46  Admittedly, MDL has generated its own  set of controversies,  but  on its own terms,  it is a
success. See JOHN C. COFFEE, JR., ENTREPRENEURIAL LITIGATION: ITS RISE, FALL, AND FUTURE 155
(2015)  (describing the MDL statute as "[t]he most successful step in the administration  of aggregate
litigation in the United States").

USA, 568 U.S. 398 (2013). Note also that the MDL cases were resolved not with the transferee judge
issuing (or denying) nationwide relief but with Congress stamping out the litigation entirely. See FISA
Amendments Act of 2008, Pub. L. No.  110-261,  § 201,  122 Stat. 2436, 2468  70 (2008) (codified at

examples  are not the prototypical public law cases that we address  in this
Essay.51 Perhaps  more importantly, these  cases are  outliers-they  are the
best examples we could find among the 2,782 MDLs that have been created
during the  fifty-year  lifetime  of the  statute. Instead,  the  list of MDLs  is
dominated  by  classic  private  law  claims:  products  liability,  mass  torts,
antitrust, commercial law, and consumer law.5 As if to make our point, the
2 
government  has  sought  consolidation  of FOIA  litigation  related  to  the
travel ban but not for the travel ban litigation itself.5 To be sure, the line
1 
between  "public"  and  "private"  law  cases  is  blurry;  MDLs  involving
private  law  claims  against  private  defendants  have  intensely  public
consequences.  Cases  in  these  areas-and  particularly  ones  involving  a
nationwide set of litigants-may be of national importance.  Nevertheless,
there  is  a  difference  between  these  cases,  which  typically  involve  tort
claims against corporate defendants,  and challenges to federal government
action, which have not been consolidated.
There  have been plausible candidates  for MDL among recent public
law  cases.  During  the  Obama  Administration,  the  Supreme  Court
entertained  public  law  litigation  with  national  consequences  involving
issues from immigration (deferred action)54 to marriage equality (DOMA)55
administrative  law cases. See In re Clean Water Rule: Definition of "Waters of the United States,"
140 F. Supp. 3d 1340,  1341 (J.P.M.L. 2015) (denying consolidation of related suits challenging EPA
rule); In re Removal From U.S. Marine Corps Reserve Active Status List Litig., 787 F. Supp. 2d 1350,
1351 (J.P.M.L. 2011) (denying consolidation of Administrative Procedure Act cases). The Panel denied
a series of MDL requests in IRS subpoena cases as well. See, e.g., In re Cybil Fisher Litig., 987 F.
Supp. 2d 1376, 1376 (J.P.M.L. 2013).
5  The 9/11 litigation and the BP case involved major issues of national concern, but they lacked
the classically public law character in their claims or proposed remedies. See Samuel Issacharoff & D.
Theodore Rave, The BP Oil Spill Settlement and the Paradox ofP ublic Litigation, 74 LA. L. REV. 397,
401 (2014) (noting that the BP Oil Spill's "mass harms take on the quality of public law litigation, even
if played  out in  thousands  of claims  for private  recompense"  (footnote omitted)).  Although  the
Endangered Species Act cases sought declaratory and injunctive relief against a government agency in
an area of public law, they lack theje ne sais quoi of the cases at issue in this Essay.

classic questions of fact for which one resolution might be more convenient
than many.62 In short, therefore,  § 1407  could have been satisfied.63 And
yet, the JPML did not (at  least formally)  even  consider  consolidation in
these  cases.  Commentators,  too,  seemed  uninterested  in  consolidation.

"marriage  equality,"  "Affordable  Care  Act,"  "Obamacare,"  "executive

This  lack  of interest is  all the more  puzzling  because MDL  would
seem to have been in the interest of the some of the players in these cases.66
Most obviously, MDL seems like it would have been in the interest of the
government defendants. For the federal government, MDL appears to solve
two  key  problems:  a multiple-plaintiff  problem67 and  a  forum-shopping
problem.68 First,  the government  might turn to MDL because it believes
that it has a better chance  of success  arguing before a single judge rather
than many. Consider the travel ban litigation. When these cases were being
litigated  in  district  courts,  the problem  for  the  government  was  that,  in
order  for the ban to remain in place,  it needed to  win every single  case
challenging  the  ban.  From  the  plaintiffs'  perspective,  if even  one  suit
succeeded  in obtaining  a preliminary injunction, the ban would be halted
nationwide.9 But had all of the cases been consolidated in a single MDL
proceeding, then the government  would have needed to win only once to
avoid a preliminary injunction.  Indeed, the Administration was successful
before Judge Nathaniel M. Gorton in Massachusetts. 70  If he had been the
MDL judge,  the  government  would not have  had  to  continue  litigating
other district court cases around the country.
65 Technically,  there were  two potentially  relevant  results. One  was  a  blog  post  we  wrote
previewing this article. Andrew Bradt & Zachary Clopton, MDL v. Trump, DORF ON LAW (Feb. 13,
2017), http://www.dorfonlaw.org/2017/02/mdl-v-trump.html  [https://perma.cc/5NLC-83GY].  The other
was a discussion of litigation  against Donald Trump and  others arising from the failed Taj Mahal
Casino. See In re Donald J.T rump Casino Sec. Litig., 7 F.3d 357 (3d Cir. 1993).
66  Recall that the JPML may consider consolidation upon the motion of any party in any action
proposed for consolidation, or upon the JPML's own initiative. 28 U.S.C. § 1407(c).
67  The  challenge resonates with the "multiple-claimant  anomaly"  in the law of preclusion. See
generally CHARLES  ALAN WRIGHT & ARTHUR  R. MILLER,  FEDERAL PRACTICE AND  PROCEDURE
§ 4465.3 (2d ed. 1987); Brainerd Currie, Civil Procedure: The Tempest Brews, 53 CALIF. L. REV. 25
(1965); Brainerd Currie, Mutuality of CollateralE stoppel: Limits of the BernhardD octrine, 9 STAN. L.
REV. 281 (1957). Though the government is not subject to offensive nonmutual issue preclusion, United
States v. Mendoza, 464 U.S. 154, 162 (1984), the availability of nationwide injunctions replicates this
anomaly.
68  See, e.g., Atlantic Star, [1974] AC 436 (HL) 471 (Eng.) ("'Forum shopping' is a dirty word; but
it is only a pejorative way of saying that, if you offer a plaintiff a choice of jurisdictions, he will
naturally choose the one in which he thinks his case can be most favourably presented: this should be a
matter neither for surprise nor for indignation.").
69  See supra note 67 and accompanying text (discussing multiple-claimant anomaly).
70  Louhghalam v. Trump, 230 F.3d 26, 38 (D. Mass. 2017).NORTHWESTERN  UNIVERSITY  LAW REVIEW
The second reason the government might turn to MDL is as a tool to
fight forum shopping. Many people have been critical of the recent spate of
nationwide injunctions allowing plaintiffs to forum shop for courts likely to
issue judgments in their favor that  apply nationwide.71 In Samuel  Bray's
excellent  treatment  of  these  injunctions,  he  collected  numerous  such
injunctions issued against the Obama Administration from federal courts in
Texas and against the George W. Bush Administration from federal courts
in California.72 Although, in theory, the JPML could send the government
to  an unfavorable  district  every  time,  it  seems  unlikely  that  the  JPML
would  be  so  uniformly  plaintiff  friendly-and  even  if  it  were,  the
government would be left no worse off.
Plaintiffs also might see a strategic advantage in MDL. Recall that any
party to any action may request consolidation.73 If even one plaintiff in one
of these cases were unhappy with her draw of a district judge,74 she might
be intrigued by a JPML on which six of seven judges were appointed to the
bench by President  Clinton.75 Such a plaintiff would hope that a friendly
JPML might pick and choose  cases to send to friendly MDL judges. Even
if this would not be the interest of the entire collection of plaintiffs, it might
be  sufficiently  in  the  interest  of a  single  plaintiff  (or  her  lawyers)  to
motivate a motion to consolidate.76
Yet  another  reason  that  either  plaintiffs  or  defendants  might  be
interested  in  MDL  is  as  a  means  to  hasten  Supreme  Court  review.
Sometimes the Supreme  Court will wait to resolve an issue until there has
71  See, e.g., Bray, supra note 61, at 2. This problem is exacerbated by the long-standing practice of
according home-state senators a role in the selection of judicial nominees. See generally LEE EPSTEIN &
JEFFREY A. SEGAL, ADVICE AND CONSENT: THE POLITICS OF JUDICIAL APPOINTMENTS (2005).
72  See Bray, supra note 61, at 8  10.
71  See 28 U.S.C. § 1407(a) (2012).
74 Even a plaintiff forum  shopping for a  favorable judicial district might be unhappy with the
particular judge within that district.

76  See, e.g., Amchem Prods., Inc. v. Windsor, 521 U.S. 591,  625 (1997)  (noting that the inquiry
into adequacy of representation "serves to uncover conflicts of interest between named parties and the
class  they  seek  to represent");  Bruce Hay  &  David  Rosenberg,  "'Sweetheart" and "'Blackmail"
Settlements in Class Actions: Reality and Remedy, 75 NOTRE DAME L. REV. 1377, 1377 (2000) (noting
"the problem of 'sweetheart'  settlements, in which the class members' interests are compromised by
class counsel"). Plaintiffs' lawyers also might use MDL to cut off other plaintiffs' lawyers' independent
management  of their cases. See, e.g.,  Elizabeth Chamblee Burch, Judging Multidistrict Litigation,
90 N.Y.U. L. REV. 71, 80 (2015) (discussing attorney incentives in MDL).112:905 (2018) MDL v. Trump
been an opportunity for percolation.77 Were a party interested in taking its
argument  straight  to  the  Supreme  Court,  it  could  use  MDL  as  an
antipercolation device. In that situation, the Supreme Court could not delay
consideration  of an important case on the grounds  of percolation  because
all potentially percolating cases would have been consolidated and resolved
in the MDL court.
Public law MDL also might pique judicial interests. It is possible that
one of the district judges hearing a major public law case might be inclined
to pass the hot potato,78 or that some of the JPML judges might be eager to
snatch these high-profile cases.79 Judges are people too, and thus they might
have preferences (in either direction) about their roles in high-profile cases.
Yet, they too have seemingly declined to propose MDL in public law-like
cases.
In short, parties and judges have had opportunities to request MDL in
public  law  cases-and  they  have  had  reasons  to  do  so.  Despite  these
reasons, however, they have demurred. The explanation may be as a simple
as  the parties'  risk aversion  when  it  comes  to rolling  the  dice  with  the
JPML.80 Or, there may be some path dependence-lawyers  on both sides,
often repeat players, may  simply intuit that public law MDL is not done
because it has not been done so far.8" Whatever the explanation, the public
law MDL has remained an anomaly.
Observing that multidistrict litigation has been available but unused in
major public law cases sounds  like the set up for a pitch for more public
law MDL.  Yet, as  explained  in the next part, there  are  sound reasons to
oppose any such  expansion-and to implore  the JPML to resist any such
temptation.
77 See SUP. CT. R. 10(a) (suggesting among the factors auguring in favor of certiorari would be that
"a United States court of appeals has entered a decision in conflict with the decision of another United
States court of appeals on the same important matter").
78  Technically the transferor judge may not order JPML consideration sua sponte, but it would not
be hard for a motivated judge to gently suggest that a party should make such a motion.
7' 28 U.S.C. § 1407(c)(i) (2012).
80  Plaintiffs may prefer a multitude of cases and are happy to take their chances by forum shopping
in districts where a majority of the judges seem amenable to their position; the government may prefer
the opportunity to litigate over and over again, immune to collateral estoppel in individual cases it loses.
81 This argument might be especially compelling because the types of lawyers familiar with MDL
(e.g., mass tort lawyers) are not usually involved in public law cases. Or, to put it another way, we
might be more likely to see a public law party invoke MDL when represented pro bono by one of these
MDL-familiar private lawyers.NORTHWESTERN  UNIVERSITY  LAW REVIEW
III. WHY THE JPML SHOULD USUALLY DECLINE TO CONSOLIDATE
PUBLIC LAW CASES
The previous Part explained  that MDL is a plausible tool for public
law cases. This Part explains why we nevertheless  oppose the use of that
tool. First, the kind of public law cases that may be candidates  for MDL
would  not  benefit  from  the  usual  strengths  of  consolidated  resolution:
reducing  discovery  costs,  providing  singular  resolution,  and  facilitating
settlement.  And  any  such  consolidation  deprives  the  federal  courts  of
potentially  meaningful  percolation.  Second,  despite  superficial  appeal,
MDL would not be an effective  bulwark  against forum shopping in these
cases. Indeed, any attempt to use MDL to check forum shopping may have
the dynamic effect  of undercutting MDL  as a tool for resolving complex
civil disputes.
A.  Efficiency v. Percolation
One reason to be dubious of MDL in public law cases is that those
cases  likely  would  not  obtain  the  traditional  efficiency  benefits  of
consolidation.
First of all, one major benefit of MDL is that it can reduce potentially
massive  discovery  costs  in  complex  cases.2  A  single judge  overseeing
consolidated  cases  is in a  better position to  police  duplicative  discovery
requests than scores of judges hearing hundreds of separate cases. A single
judge  also  could resolve  each  of the many inevitable  discovery  disputes
only once-a major savings for court  and lawyer resources. On the expert
side, Daubert motions, which are often very expensive and central to the
resolution of mass tort cases, can be centralized too.83
But while these issues are significant for complex civil cases, they are
not so pressing in public law litigation. In many public law cases, discovery
is minimal or nonexistent.14 Indeed, the fact that preliminary injunctions are
so central in these cases suggests that much of the legal work can be done
82  Civil discovery costs have been central to many of the important fights in civil procedure in the
last few decades. See, e.g., Adam N. Steinman, The End of an Era? FederalC  ivil ProcedureA fter the
2015 Amendments, 66 EMORY  L.J. 1, 44 (2016) (discussing discovery  amendments  to the Federal
Rules); Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 558  60 (2007) (discussing relationship between
pleading standards and discovery costs).
83  See, e.g., In re Bextra & Celebrex Mktg. Sales Practices & Prod. Liab. Litig., 524 F. Supp. 2d

(MTBE) Prods. Liab.  Litig., 593 F. Supp. 2d 549,  563 (S.D.N.Y.  2008). See generally Daubert v.
Merrell Dow Pharm., 509 U.S. 579 (1993).
84  Even questions of fact, such as  intent, often may be resolved  on the public record or thin
discovery. See supra note 62 and accompanying text.112:905 (2018) MDL v. Trump
on a thin record.85  The travel  ban cases provide  an excellent  example-
much of the crucial legal work was done at the preliminary injunction stage
without any fact discovery. Consolidating discovery, therefore, would be of
little use.
Second, MDL's ability to facilitate global settlement is likely to be of
less  utility in public  law cases.86  If available,  class action treatment may
allow  parties  to  efficiently  settle  all  related  claims.17 But  when  class
treatment is unavailable-which is increasingly  the case given the federal
courts'  hostility to Rule 2388-MDL is an important vehicle to make non-
class settlement less burdensome.  The MDL judge can manage settlement
negotiations  and play  a highly  important information-forcing  role among
parties.89 Consider the yeoman's work of the BP oil spill MDL, in which
hundreds  of cases  involving thousands  of individual  claims were  settled
without the aid of a global class action.90
Here  again,  however,  public  law  MDLs  look  different.  Although
certainly public law cases may be voluntarily dismissed based on amicable
resolution, those resolutions do not look like private law settlements.  The
issues in these cases are of public concern, and "settlement"  would be the
result  of  a  political  process  that  seems  like  a  poor  candidate  for
"managerial judging."9  The problem in the travel ban cases, for example, is
not that the President has been unable to get in a room with representatives
of the various affected groups in order to demonstrate  the art of the deal.
And any change in immigration policy is not likely to result from an MDL
judge  ordering  court-sponsored  mediation  or  enlisting  the  services  of a
high-profile  special  master92 but  from political  deal  making  or  electoral
93
turnover.
85 See supra notes 71  72 and accompanying text (discussing nationwide injunctions). Moreover, to
the extent that some public law cases will turn on specific factual evidence  think, for example, proof
of the harm on different classes of citizens  that evidence will be case specific and thus not susceptible
to consolidation.  And, again, even those  costs likely will be low compared to complex private law
litigation.

Multidistrict Litigation, 105 CALIF. L. REV.  1259,  1291  (2017)  (describing how MDL  is a "superb
vehicle for the development of information in modern mass-tort litigation").

others). For an unusual (and non-MDL)  counterexample, see United States v. AT&T, 567 F.2d  121,NORTHWESTERN  UNIVERSITY  LAW REVIEW
Finally  (and  relatedly),  MDL  may  promote  singular  resolution  by
resolving  all cases  on the merits94 or resolving  important  issues that  can
lead to settlement. 5 The idea of consolidating some public law cases is not
new-indeed,  consolidated  litigation  for  injunctive  relief in  civil  rights
cases  was  the  animating  purpose  of Federal  Rule  of Civil  Procedure
23(b)(2). 96  Mandatory  classes  for  injunctive  relief  not  only  offer  the
efficiency benefits of consolidation, but they also insulate the government
from having to comply with potentially inconsistent obligations imposed by
different courts.97
However  they  are  litigated, public  law  cases  can  produce  singular
judgments too-but we might not be so eager to reach that result at the trial
court level and, potentially, even on a motion for a preliminary injunction.8
In cases like those addressed in this Essay, there may be systemic benefits
from  multiple  decisions  by  multiple judges  arising  from  arguments  by
multiple  lawyers.99  Since  cases  of this magnitude  are  likely  to  wind  up
before the Supreme Court,100 the quality of justice may improve with even a
123  25 (D.C. Cir.  1977), describing court-sponsored mediation of interbranch dispute over executive
privilege as it related to congressional subpoenas.

1183, 1242  43 (2013)  (describing the potential benefits of settlements in mandatory class actions for
injunctive relief).
98  While the existence of the Rule 23(b)(2) class action recognizes that a single answer in public
law  litigation  may  be desirable,  it  does not  preempt the question  of whether MDL  treatment is
appropriate  in the cases we discuss  especially when  many of these cases seek preliminary relief,
which could be accorded prior to decisions  about class certification. Instead, the question becomes
whether MDL  treatment of multiple  (b)(2)  class  actions  makes  sense  at  the outset. For reasons
described here, we think not.
Moreover, we think it is significant that the standard for class certification is much higher than
the low bar for MDL  consolidation. Arguments  for a single resolution are  stronger when there is
numerosity, commonality, typicality, adequacy, and the government has acted on grounds applicable to
the class as a whole. See FED. R. CIV. P. 23(a), (b)(2). And, in contrast to MDL (as described in the next
Section), a decision by a single district judge to certify a Rule 23(b)(2) class does not pose any special
risk of politicizing the JPML or undermining the ability of the federal courts to resolve mass tort cases.

little bit of percolation  in the lower courts.101 And even if the benefits  of
percolation are weak, the countervailing costs to efficiency from foregoing
consolidation are not significant either.
B.  Forum Shopping v. JudicialP  oliticization
Even  if MDL does  not provide the  usual  benefits  when applied  to
public law cases, we suggested above that the government might find MDL
attractive for a different reason:  as a check on forum shopping.102 Lawsuits
against the federal government  for matters  of national policy often can be
litigated anywhere, and rational plaintiffs select districts that will give them
the best chances to succeed. 103 Especially when the district judge may issue
relief with national or universal scope,104 the government should be wary of
a plaintiff's handpicked district.
Although  our  earlier  discussion  was  framed  as  a  reason  that  the
government  might be inclined to seek consolidation, the same  arguments
may be relevant to the broader public policy question.105 Certainly, there is
disagreement  about how much forum shopping should be permitted,106  but
we suspect that there is wide agreement that the U.S.  legal  system should
have  some  way  to  check  unbridled  court  selection.  In individual  cases,
federal  courts can cut back on plaintiff forum shopping in the interest of
justice with a horizontal venue transfer under  § 1404(a).107 Perhaps  MDL
101S ee, e.g., Maryland v. Balt. Radio Show, Inc., 338 U.S. 912, 918 (1950) ("It may be desirable to
have different aspects of an issue further illumined by the lower courts. Wise adjudication has its own
time for ripening."); Samuel Estreicher & John E. Sexton, A ManagerialT heory of the Supreme Court's
Responsibilities:A n EmpiricalS tudy, 59 N.Y.U. L. REV. 681, 719 (1984) ("A managerial conception of
the Court's role embraces lower court percolation as an affirmative value. The views of the lower courts
on a particular legal issue provide the Supreme Court with a means of identifying significant rulings as
well as an experimental base and a set of doctrinal materials with which to fashion sound binding
law."). But see, e.g., Paul Bator, What Is Wrong with the Supreme Court?, 51 U. PITT. L. REV. 673, 689
(1990) ("First, we must always remember that perpetuating uncertainty and instability during a process
of percolation exacts important and painful costs.").

104 Id.;s ee also  Bray, supra note  61,  at  8  10  (discussing  these  injunctions  and  collecting
examples).
105 In future work, we intend to explore  more deeply the role of the MDL process in forum
shopping generally, and the significant power wielded by the JPML in this regard.
106 See, e.g.,  Pamela K. Bookman,  The Unsung Virtues of Global Forum Shopping, 92 NOTRE
DAME L. REV. 583,  587 (2016) (highlighting "unappreciated virtues of global forum shopping" and
collecting sources arguing that forum shopping is "often a neutral practice").
107 See 28 U.S.C.  § 1404(a). See generally Edmund W. Kitch, Section 1404(a) of the Judicial
Code: In the Interest of Justice or Injustice?, 40 IND. L.J. 99 (1965).  Removal achieves  this effect
vertically,  28  U.S.C.  § 1441(a)  (allowing  removal  from  state  to  federal  court),  and  forum  non
conveniens is available intersystemically. See Piper Aircraft Co. v. Reyno, 454 U.S. 235,  261 (1981)
(granting forum non conveniens motion to dismiss in favor of litigation in Scotland).NORTHWESTERN  UNIVERSITY  LAW REVIEW
also  can  achieve  an anti-forum-shopping  function-much like  § 1404(a),
the  MDL  statute  gives  the  JPML  the  power  to  move  cases  based  on
considerations of justice.18
Furthermore,  using  MDL  to  fight  forum  shopping  rather  than  §
1404(a) might avoid some of the biases inherent in that latter procedure.109
By  statute,  §  1404(a)  transfers  are  at  the  discretion  of the  potential
transferor judge.110 Presumably,  some judges are disinclined to give away
high-profile  cases,111  and  as  such  they  would  be  disinclined  to  grant  §
1404(a) motions.112 This seems especially likely if the plaintiff is successful
in landing a politically friendly judge, who may be wary of transferring  a
case to the  less  friendly  district requested  by  defendant.113  Avoiding the
transferor-judge  bias  of § 1404(a),  the MDL  statute  assigns  the  transfer
decision to the independent judgment of the JPML. 114
In spite of these advantages  to using MDL to limit forum shopping,
there are a number of reasons it may be a poor response in the public law
context.  First,  while  § 1404(a)  transfers  typically  identify  the  transferee
district,115  JPML  orders  typically  identify  the  transferee judge1.16  This
approach might make some sense when trying to identify a judge capable
of handling  a truly complex piece  of litigation117 or trying to build  up a
'o' See 28 U.S.C. § 1407(a) (suggesting that consolidation  should, among others, "promote the
just..,  conduct  of such  actions).  Section  1407  consolidations  are  for pretrial purposes  only, but
especially when a TRO or preliminary injunction is a significant goal, then pretrial purposes become
more prominent than the name suggests.
109  MDL also might be better at checking forum shopping because while § 1404(a) transfers are
limited to the districts where the case might have been brought, the JPML may transfer to "any district."
Compare 28 U.S.C. § 1404(a), with id. § 1407(a).
110  See § 1404(a).
111 One need not be a student of the "endowment effect" to recognize that judges might have an
attachment to cases before them. See Daniel Kahneman, et al., Experimental Tests of the Endowment
Effect and the Coase Theorem, 98 J.P OL. ECON. 1325, 133235 (1990) (summarizing studies).
112  Clermont and Eisenberg found that the success rate of § 1404(a) transfer motions was close to
(but  less than) 50%.  Kevin  M. Clermont &  Theodore  Eisenberg, Exorcising the Evil of Forum-
Shopping, 80 CORNELL L. REV. 1507, 1529 (1995). Their study does not identify the baseline for the
right number of transfers, nor does it address high-profile cases in particular.
113  Of course, some judges might want to duck high-profile cases or they might have a "preference
for leisure," either of which would result in an overuse of § 1404(a) transfers. See RICHARD A. POSNER,
How JUDGES THINK 36 (2008). Whatever the direction of the bias, in all cases transferor-judge bias will
be introduced.
114  It is also possible that the group decisionmaking of the Panel improves outcomes. See generally
JAMES SUROWIECKI, THE WISDOM OF CROWDS (2004).
115 See 28 U.S.C. § 1404(a).

cadre  of judges capable of doing so."8 But when it comes  to high-profile,
public law cases, the selection of a transferee judge is necessarily fraught.
Every federal district judge was appointed to her seat by a president  from
one party or the other.  Every federal  district judge has  a record that may
trouble one or more parties. 9  In other words, for the JPML, every choice
in  these  cases  is  one that  might  attract  criticism,  whether  warranted  or
not. 120
Moreover, once the JPML is recognized as a powerful political agent,
there  will be  a temptation  to  use  it politically.  Empirical  studies  have
demonstrated  that  appointments  to  the  JPML  do  not  have  a  strong
ideological edge.121 Indeed,  as of this writing,  of the fifty judges to have
served on the JPML,  exactly twenty-five were appointed to the bench by
Republican presidents and twenty-five by Democratic presidents. 122 But one
could  imagine  Chief Justice  John  Roberts  (or  a  future  Chief  Justice)
responding to  an increasingly  political  JPML by  appointing judges more
amenable  to  his  own  political  philosophy.  Indeed,  the  Chief has  been
criticized  on  exactly  this  score  for  his  selections  for  the  Civil  Rules
118  See, e.g., In re TD Bank, N.A., Debit Card Overdraft Fee Litig., 96 F. Supp. 3d 1378,  1379
(J.P.M.L. 2015); In re Lidoderm Antitrust Litig., 11 F. Supp. 3d 1344, 1345  46 (J.P.M.L. 2014) (noting
that selection of transferee district allows assignment of case to a district that "has the necessary judicial
resources and expertise to efficiently manage this litigation.").
119 An additional consideration may be governing law. In MDL cases, lower federal courts have
long held that, for federal question cases, the law of the transferee circuit applies to cases transferred
into the MDL. See In re Korean Air Lines Disaster of September 1, 1983, 829 F. 2d 1171,  1176 (D.C.
Cir.  1987)  (noting that law of transferor  forums do not hold stare decisis).  This practice stands in
contrast with state law cases under the diversity jurisdiction transferred to MDLs, in which the MDL
court must apply the law that the transferor court would have applied. See Andrew D. Bradt, The
Shortest Distance: Direct Filing and Choice of Law in Multidistrict Litigation, 88 NOTRE DAME L.
REV. 759, 793 (2012). As a result, the selection of the MDL judge may include selection of the circuit
law that would apply both in the MDL court and  on appeal. See Richard Marcus,  Conflict Among
Circuits and Transfers Within the FederalJ udicial System, 93 YALE L.J. 677 (1984). This, too, might
be a source of backlash.
120 Although our goal in the Essay is to discourage the use of MDL for public law cases, were the
JPML inclined to get involved, the foregoing  analysis suggests a few potential options: (i)  random
assignment, which is  the JPML's practice  for a certain  class  of administrative  law cases, see id.
§ 2112(a)(3)); (ii) assignment to a district (rather than a  specific judge) with an instruction for that
district to use random assignment;  or  (iii) assignment to  multiple judges, (see 28 U.S.C.  § 1407(b)
(referring to "judge or judges to whom such actions are assigned")).
121 See, e.g., Tracey E. George & Margaret S. Williams, Designing Judicial Institutions:  Special
Federal Courts and the U.S. Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation (2013) (unpublished manuscript),

appointed by a Republican president.NORTHWESTERN  UNIVERSITY  LAW REVIEW
Advisory  Committee123 and the Foreign Intelligence  Surveillance Court.124
Even if the current JPML could act apolitically  in these cases,  it may be
only a matter of time before  a new set of panel judges might break that
norm. 125
The selection of judges for political reasons also might have spillover
effects for more traditional MDL cases. Currently, the JPML is made up of
judges who are well versed in managing  complex private litigation. But if
the panel starts being involved in more controversial  cases, a Chief Justice
might be inclined to consider ideological priorities in making appointments
that may not line up with efficient resolution of mass torts. This would be
an  especially  inauspicious  outcome  because,  even  if  the  government
routinely brought public law suits to the JPML, they would be substantially
outnumbered by the tens of thousands  of private MDL cases each year.126
For those of us who think that the JPML has done a commendable job in
managing  complex  litigation,  it  would be  a pity  to  see  it  give  up  that
127
expertise. 
Finally, not only might  a political  JPML attract  the attention of the
Chief Justice,  it also might attract the attention  of Congress  (or interested
parties  lobbying Congress). MDL is already in the political  crossfire over
aggregate  litigation generally.  For example,  a recent House bill proposed
reining  in some  of the  advantages plaintiffs  are  thought to have in MDL
proceedings. 1 Again,  it  would  be  disappointing  to  lose  the  ability  to

public law ones that did not really need consolidation in the first place.
CONCLUSION
There  is nothing doctrinal  or statutory  standing in the way of MDL
treatment of the sorts of public law cases being brought against the Trump
Administration. And our suspicion is that, sooner or later, a party to one of
these cases is going to give it a shot by filing a motion for consolidation of
pretrial proceedings  with the Judicial  Panel on Multidistrict Litigation. It
might be the government,  which may prefer  fighting on one front, rather
than all around the country. Or it might be a plaintiff, who might believe
that consolidated treatment will allow for economies  of scale and provide
an  opportunity to take  the lead  on the nationwide  litigation.  Even more
strategically, it might be a plaintiff or defendant who would rather take her
chances  with  a judicial assignment  by the JPML than  with the judge to
whom her case has been assigned.
But while the idea of efficiently consolidating public law cases might
be superficially  attractive, we think it would be a mistake for the JPML to
wade into these cases and contrary to the statutory requirement that the use
of MDL "promote the just and efficient conduct of such actions." Any such
move is unlikely to bring considerable benefits, and it risks politicizing the
Panel and undermining its core function. Instead, for the reasons described
in this Essay, we urge the JPML to  consider the limited  efficiency  MDL
offers in public law cases as compared to its substantial risks, and we hope
that  MDL remains  primarily  the  province  of mass  torts-and  our Civil
Procedure classroom hypotheticals.NORTHWESTERN  UNIVERSITY  LAW REVIEW
