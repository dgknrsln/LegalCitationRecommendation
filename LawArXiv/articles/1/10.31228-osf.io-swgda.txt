INTRODUCTION
From humble beginnings,1  federal substantive  criminal law has
grown to prohibit a wide range of conduct, including much that state
criminal laws also proscribe.2  This expansion, commonly called feder-
alization, has recently attracted substantial academic criticism.3  Some
1.  Under the Constitution, Congress has explicit power to criminalize only counterfeiting,
see U.S. CONT. art. I, § 8, cl. 6; "Piracies and Felonies committed on the high Seas, and Offences
against the Law of Nations," id. cl. 10; offenses committed on federal property, see id, cl. 17; and
treason, see id. art. III, §3, ci. 2. Although the First Congress soon criminalized other conduct,
such as obstruction of justice in federal courts, see Crimes Act of 1790, 1 STAT. 112, until the
Reconstruction era, federal criminal law was limited to "punishment of acts directly injurious to
the central government."  L.B. Schwartz, Federal Criminal Jurisdictiona nd Prosecutors' Discre-
tion, 13 L,v & CONTEMP. PROBS. 64, 65 (1948).  See also DwiGrr  F. HENDERSON, CONGRESS,
CoURTS, AND CRMINALS: THE DEVELOPMENT OF FEDERAL CRIMINAL LAW, 1801-1829 (1985).
2.  Some have estimated that there are now over 3000 separate federal crimes.  See, eg.,
REPORT OF TmE FED. Ors. STUDY Comm. 106 (1990) [HEREINAFrMR REPORT]  (citing 3000 fig-
ure).  See also United States v. Lanier, 73 F.3d 1380, 1382 (6th Cir. 1996) (en banc) (referring to
"more than 700 crimes in the federal criminal code"), vacated, 117 S. Ct. 1219 (1997).  Many of
these federal crimes duplicate existing state criminal offenses.  See, eg., Sarah Sun Beale, Too
Many and Yet Too Few: New Principles to Define Proper Limits for Federal CriminalJ urisdic-
tion, 46 HASTINGS L.J. 979, 997-98 (1995) (listing overlapping federal and state crimes); infra
notes 42-59 and accompanying text.
3.  Three recent Symposia address the topic. See Symposium: Federalisma nd the Criminal
Justice System, 98 W. VA. L. REv. 757 (1996); Symposium: The Federal Role in Criminal Law,
543 ANNALS AM. ACAD. PoL. & Soc. Sci. 15 (1996); Symposium: Federalizationo f Crime: The

critics bemoan the federal government's intrusion into matters histori-
cally left to the states.4  Others denounce  the burden on the federal
judiciary  of  an  increasing  criminal  caseload.5  However,  there  has
been far less attention devoted  to what may be the most troubling
consequence of federalization: the dramatically disparate treatment of
similarly  situated offenders,  depending  on whether  they are prose-
cuted in federal  or state court.6  This Article  addresses  that conse-
quence and contends that equal protection doctrine has a role to play
in preventing unprincipled disparity.
Jurisdiction:A  Case Against Making Federal Cases, 14 SETON HALL L.R  v. 574 (1984).  Not all
agree that federalization deserves the attention it now receives. See G. Robert Blakely, Federal
CriminalL aw: The Need, Not ForR evised Constitutional Theory or New CongressionalS tatutes,
But the Exercise of Responsible Prosecutive Discretion,4 6 HASTINGS L.J. 1175,1176 & n.4 (1995)
(concluding that "[w]e should not be talking about 'federalization'  and characterizing Sympo-
sium on federalization as "a tragic waste of intellectual resources").
4.  See, ag., Jamie S. Gorelick & Harry Litman, ProsecutorialD iscretion and the Federali-
zation Debate, 46 HASTNGS LJ.9 67, 968 (1995) (noting that some critics "believe that some of
the recently enacted federal crimes inappropriately infringe on federalism interests by taking
matters traditionally of local concern out of the hands of local officials"); Schwarzer & Wheeler,
supra note 3, at 664-65 (summarizing contentions of critics).
5.  See, eg., Beale, supran ote 2, at 983-91 (describing the "most visible cost" of federaliza-
tion as "the burden imposed on the relatively small federal judicial system"); Gorelick & Lit-
man, supra note 4, at 968 (noting critics' concern that federalization  "will swamp the federal
courts with 'local' crimes, thereby preventing them from fulfilling a traditional role of adjudicat-
ing distinctively federal matters"); REPORT, supra note 2, at 6 (describing "the long-expected
crisis of the federal courts" caused in part by "the expanded federal effort to reduce drug traf-
ficking."). Not all observers agree that federalization has created unmanageable burdens for the
federal judiciary.  See Rory K. Little, Myths and Principles of Federalization,4 6 HAsrnNms L.J.
1029, 1034, 1038-47 (1995) (describing claims of crisis in federal judicial caseload as a "myth");
Schwarzer & Wheeler, supra note 3, at 672-85 (discussing arguments on both sides).  Cf. Dennis
E. Curtis, Comment, CongressionalP owers and FederalJudiciaBl urdens, 46 HASTNGS L.J. 1019,
1024-25 (1995) (proposing an increase in the size of the federal judiciary).
6.  Although Professor L.B. Schwartz  recognized, almost  half a century  ago, that the
growth of federal criminal law could cause disparate treatment, see Schwartz, supra note 1, at 71-
72, almost all of the recent treatment of federalization focuses on other issues. See Little, supra
note 5, at 1037 ("The current critique of the federalization of crime can be described as encom-
passing four general types of concerns: (1) workload, (2) open forum, (3) dignity, and (4) feder-
alism concerns."); Schwarzer & Wheeler, supra note 3 (discussing federalization debate without
mention of disparity in treatment). Government efforts to address federalization are similarly
deficient.  See Sara Sun Beale, Reporter's Draft for the Working Group on Principles to Use
When Consideringt he Federalizationo f CriminalL aw, 46 HASTINcs LJ.1 277,1277 (1995) (gov-
ernment's two major concerns are caseload of federal courts and federal/state relations). Profes-
sor Beale has addressed the issue of disparate treatment.  See Beale, supra note 2, at 982, 996-
1004. See also Hollon, supra note 3 (discussing disparate treatment); Kenny, supra note 3, at 576
(noting "inherent unfairness to a defendant who loses the increased protections his state consti-
tution may afford when he is brought into federal court").  Professor Beale identifies disparate
treatment and increased burdens on the federal judiciary as the principle adverse consequences
of federalization.  See Beale, supran ote 2. She proposes shifting litigation of federal offenses to
the state courts as a solution. See id. at 1008-15; see also Mengler, supra note 3, at 535 (present-
ing a similar proposal).  Beale recognizes that transfer of prosecutions to the states will not alone
HeinOnline -- 70 S. Cal. L. Rev. 646 1996-19971997] FEDERALIZATION OF CRIMINAL LAW
As a result of the growth of federal criminal law, much criminal
conduct  is  now  subject  to  federal  as  well  as  state  prosecution.7
Although the states prosecute the majority of offenders whose  con-
duct violates both state and federal law, federal prosecution is not un-
common.8  Because of differences between federal and state criminal
justice systems, an offender will often fare worse if prosecuted in fed-
eral court rather than state court.  He9 may be detained pending trial
when he would have been released if charged in state court,'0  denied
discovery allowable in state court,"  and confronted with evidence that
would have been suppressed in state court.'2  If convicted, a federally
end disparate treatment. As a result, she also calls for "uniform standards..,  to determine which
categories of cases will be subject to state rather than federal law."  She proposes two means of
achieving that objective: "general federal enforcement of all cases falling within a statutory pro-
vision or the promulgation and enforcement of clear standards identifying classes of cases that
will be subject to general federal prosecution."  Beale, supra note 2, at 1016. Both approaches
are consistent with the equal protection requirements that I discuss in this Article.
7.  Prosecution by both federal and state authorities for the same conduct is infrequent.
See United States v. Davis, 906 F.2d 829, 832 (2d Cir. 1990) (stating that "successive prosecutions
for the same conduct remain rarities"); Harry Litman & Mark D. Greenberg, Dual Prosecutions:
A Model For Concurrent FederalJ urisdiction, 543 ANNALS  AM. ACAD. POL.&  Soc. Scr. 72,77
(1996) (Department of Justice prosecutes following state prosecution for same conduct fewer
than 150 times per year out of approximately 65,000 annual federal prosecutions).  Despite the
fact that successive federal prosecutions constitute a minute portion of the federal criminal
caseload, two recent high-proffile federal civil rights prosecutions following state court acquit-
tals-the federal trial of Los Angeles Police Department officers for using unreasonable force
while arresting Rodney King and the federal trial of Lemrick Nelson, Jr., for the killing of
Yankel Rosenbaum-have drawn considerable attention to the "dual sovereignty exception" to
the Double Jeopardy Clause.  Dual sovereignty is a doctrine which allows one sovereign, such as
the federal government, to prosecute after another sovereign, such as a state, has already done
so.  See, eg., Akhil Reed Amar & Jonathan L. Marcus, Double Jeopardy Law After Rodney
King, 95 COLUM. L. REv. 1 (1995); Paul G. Cassell, The Rodney King Trials and the Double
Jeopardy Clause: Some Observations on OriginalM  eaning and the ACLU's Schizophrenic Views
of the Dual Sovereign Doctrine,4 1 UCLA L. REv. 693 (1994); Susan N. Herman, Double Jeop-
ardy All Over Again: Dual Sovereignty, Rodney King, and the ACLU, 41 UCLA L. REv. 609
(1994); Susan N. Herman, Reconstructingt he Bill of Rights: A Reply to Amar and Marcus's Triple
Play on Double Jeopardy, 95 COLUM. L. REv. 1090 (1995); Paul Hoffman, Double Jeopardy
Wars: The Casef or a Civil Rights "Exception," 41 UCLA L. REv. 649 (1994); Yale Kamisar, Call
It Double Jeopardy, N.Y. Tnvm, Feb. 14, 1997, at 37. See generally Michael A. Dawson, Note,
PopularS overeignty, Double Jeopardy, and the Dual Sovereignty Doctrine, 102 YALE L.J. 281
(1992).  Although federalization of criminal law increases opportunities for successive federal
prosecutions, the focus of this Article is different-the decision to prosecute some offenders in
federal court when they are eligible for state prosecution.
8.  See infra notes 170-74 and accompanying text.
9.  Because most federally-prosecuted  offenders  are male, see, e.g.,  U.S. SENTEN  iN
COMM'N  ANNUAL  REPORT  app. B (1994)  (84.7%  of convicted  federal offenders  are male),
throughout this Article I use the masculine pronoun to refer to offenders.  I use the female
pronoun when referring to prosecutors and defense attorneys.

prosecuted defendant  is likely to receive a longer sentence13 and  to
serve far more of that sentence than he would if sentenced in state
14
court.
United States v. Palmer'5 provides  a stark example  of such fed-
eral/state court disparity.  Palmer and Roberts were partners ina  ma-
rijuana-growing  operation  at  Palmer's  residence.'6  After  police
arrested the men, the federal prosecutor assigned to the case chose
not to bring charges against Roberts, who, as a result, was prosecuted
in state court.'7  The state court sentenced him to a fine of $1,000-
which was waived because Roberts was indigent-and assessed court
costs and fees of $176.'1  Palmer was considerably less fortunate.  The
federal prosecutor  brought charges  against him.  After Palmer was
convicted, the federal court sentenced him to a nonparolable ten-year
13.  See infra notes 159-66 and accompanying text.
14.  See infra notes 167-69 and accompanying text.  Similar issues can arise in other con-
texts. See e.g., United States v. Juvenile Male #1, 86 F.3d 1314 (4th Cir. 1996) (prosecution of
juvenile as an adult in federal court); Allison Boyce, Note, Choosing the Forum: Prosecutorial
Discretion and Walker v. State, 46 ARK. L Rnv. 985 (1994) (discussing choice between juvenile
and adult court); cf Jon J. Jensen & Kerry S. Rosenquist, Satisfaction of a Compelling Govern-
mental Interest or Simply Two Convictions for the Price of One, 69 N.D. L. REv. 915 (1994)
(federal prosecution after conviction in tribal court).
15.  3 F.3d 300 (9th Cir. 1993), cert. denied, 510 U.S. 1138 (1994).
16.  A deputy sheriff arrested Roberts after discovering marijuana in his car during a traffic
stop. See id.at  302. Another deputy told Roberts that if he cooperated, the deputy would make
efforts to prevent Roberts from being charged in federal court.  See Brief of Defendant/Appel-
lant at 5, Palmer( No. 91-30291).  Roberts told the deputy about the marijuana at Palmer's resi-
dence.  See Palmer, 3 F.3d at 302.  Aware that the federal Drug Enforcement Administration
(DEA) was interested in Palmer, who had a previous federal conviction and was the subject of
an earlier DEA investigation, the deputies' supervisor notified a DEA agent.  See id. The agent
in turn notified an Assistant United States Attorney, who indicated that "the federal govern-
ment would be interested in prosecuting the case if more than 100 marijuana plants were found."
Id. The deputies obtained a search warrant for Palmer's residence and, along with a DEA agent,
executed the warrant, finding 258 marijuana plants and growing equipment.  See Brief of De-
fendant/Appellant at 7, Palmer (No. 91-30291).
17.  The federal prosecutor considered bringing charges against Roberts and rewarding him
for his cooperation simply by seeking a reduced federal sentence.  When the federal prosecutor
learned that a deputy sheriff had induced Roberts' cooperation by promising to make efforts to
foreclose federal prosecution, see supra note 16, the federal prosecutor chose to not bring federal
charges at all. See Affidavit of Earl A. Hicks, at 2-3, United States v. Palmer (CR 91-030-JLQ).
18.  See Palmer,3  F.3d at 305 n.3. Roberts also benefited from reduced state law charges in
state court. He could have been charged with manufacturing marijuana, in violation of WASH.
REv.C ODE § 69.50.401(a)(1)(iii) (1985), but instead he agreed to plead guilty to possession of
over 40 grams of marijuana, in violation of WAsS. REv. CODE § 69.50.401(d) (1985).  Although
both crimes carry the same statutory maximum sentence, the guidelines enacted as part of Wash-
ington's Sentencing Reform Act of 1991 treat the manufacturing charge as a more serious of-
fense.  See WASH. REv. CODE § 9.94A.320 (1988) (requiring imposition of longer sentence). See
also WASH. REv. CODE §§ 9.94A.120(1), 9.94A.310 (1988).

term of imprisonment and an eight-year supervised release term, the
most lenient sentence that federal law allowed.19
Cases like Palmer, in which partners  in crime  receive different
treatment because  one is prosecuted in state court and the other in
federal court, are atypical.20  However, comparably dramatic sentenc-
ing differentials and other disparities2' routinely occur when some of-
fenders are prosecuted in state court and others, who may not be their
partners  but have  engaged  in the same  criminal  conduct  and  are
otherwise similarly situated, are instead selected for federal prosecu-
tion and  the often harsher treatment that it entails.  Such disparate
treatment occurs nationwide  on a daily basis when some defendants,
engaged in drug transactions, weapons offenses, or other crimes over
which there is overlapping federal and state criminal jurisdiction, hap-
pen to be among the unlucky ones selected for federal prosecution.22
Despite the significant ramifications of the forum selection deci-
sion, there  is  little administrative  direction  or judicial  oversight  to
guide  federal  prosecutors  in  exercising  their  discretion  to  choose
among  offenders  eligible  for federal  prosecution.  Although  there
were valid reasons for the federal prosecutor to seek harsher treat-
ment for Palmer than for Roberts,23 the prosecutor could have made
the same selection  decision without good reason, perhaps  selecting
Roberts but not Palmer. Without fear of violating Department of Jus-
tice policy or risking judicial review, the federal prosecutor could have
flipped a coin to select who to prosecute in federal court and, conse-
quently, who to subject to the possibility of a vastly more severe fed-
eral sentence.  Neither the United States Attorney's Office that chose
19.  See  Palmer, 3  F.3d  at  305  n.3.  Palmer  was  sentenced  under  21  U.S.C.
§ 841(b)(1)(B)(vii) (1992), which requires a minimum nonparolable ten-year mandatory impris-
onment term and an eight-year supervised release term for possession of 100 or more marijuana
plants with intent to distribute if the offender has a prior conviction for a drug trafficking crime.
The statute allows for imposition of a maximum sentence of life imprisonment.  See id.
20.  For other examples, see United States v. Vllchez, 967 F.2d 1351 (9th Cir. 1992) (revers-
ing district court's departure from mandatory five-year sentence to reduce defendant's sentence
to three-year sentence that partner received in state court); United States v. Reyes, 966 F.2d 508
(9th Cir. 1992), cert. denied, 506 U.S. 927 (1992) (two defendants possessed sawed-off shotgun;
federally  prosecuted  defendant received  57-month sentence,  state-prosecuted  defendant re-
ceived 300-day sentence).
21.  See infra Part I.B.
22.  See infra notes 275-85 and accompanying text.
23.  Unlike Roberts, Palmer' refused to cooperate with law enforcement. See Palmer,3  F.3d
at 302. Palmer also had a prior conviction for marijuana trafficking, had been the subject of an
earlier DEA investigation, see id., and was growing marijuana at a residence where his two
young daughters lived.  See Brief of Defendant/Appellant at 5, Palmer (No. 91-30291).  These
differences between Palmer and Roberts did not warrant the enormous disparity in treatment.
HeinOnline -- 70 S. Cal. L. Rev. 649 1996-1997SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA LAW REVIEW  [Vol. 70:643
to prosecute only Palmer nor the Department of Justice has a policy
requiring prosecutors to have rational reasons for determining which
eligible offenders to prosecute in federal court?'  Similarly, although
its consideration of Palmer's equal protection and  due process chal-
lenges  prompted the Ninth Circuit  to characterize  the prosecutor's
charging  decision  as  "troubling"  and  to conclude  that  "[t]here  is
something basically wrong with this type of exercise of prosecutorial
discretion,"26 the court refused to review the prosecutor's  decision to
select only Palmer. Consistent with approaches that other courts have
taken, the Palmer court held that "separation of powers concerns pro-
hibit us  from reviewing  a  prosecutor's  charging  decisions  absent  a
prima facie showing that it rested on an impermissible basis, such as
gender, race or denial of a constitutional right."' 7
Even  if  courts  refuse  to  enforce  it, equal protection  obligates
prosecutors to have a rational basis for distinguishing between offend-
ers who are charged and those who are not.  Both the letter and the
spirit of that command mandate that federal prosecutors have valid
reasons  for distinguishing  between  offenders  who  are  subjected to
harsher treatment as a result of federal prosecution and those who are
instead  charged  in state court.  The  Department  of Justice  should
amend its administrative guidelines to ensure compliance with equal
protection principles.
The judiciary's  role in limiting  federalization-induced  disparity
also merits examination.  One scholar has noted that, to date, "no par-
ticipants in the current federalization debate suggest a change in [the]
doctrine"  precluding judicial  oversight  of charging  decisions  absent
proof of intentional discrimination.?8  Critical examination of the un-
derpinnings of this doctrinal limitation reveals, however, that the pos-
sibility  of judicial  oversight  should  be  a  topic  of  debate.  If  the

Department of Justice does not require that its prosecutors make prin-
cipled charging decisions, and if courts are confronted with evidence
that federal prosecutors'  selection decisions may be wholly unprinci-
pled, courts should rethink their reluctance to scrutinize those deci-
sions.  Although courts  should, at most, conduct limited review that
would  rarely  afford  defendants  a  judicial  remedy,  such  oversight
would promote principled charging decisions.
Part One of this Article discusses legislative and judicial contribu-
tions to the expansion of federal substantive criminal law and its in-
creasing  overlap  with  state  criminal  prohibitions.  This  Part  then
identifies  some significant procedural  and  sentencing disparities  be-
tween federal and state prosecution.
Part Two explores the constraints that equal protection doctrine
imposes  on  prosecutors'  selection  of  offenders  and  contends  that
equal protection requires charging decisions to be rationally related to
legitimate government objectives.  Part Two also explains why the ra-
tional relationship requirement has particular significance for federal
prosecutors'  decisions to select only some eligible offenders for fed-
eral prosecution when others are charged in state court.

Part  Three  discusses  the  Department  of Justice's  prosecutive
guidelines  and  present  practice  and  demonstrates  that Department
policy not only fails to give federal prosecutors sufficient guidance to
guarantee  compliance  with the equal protection rationality require-
ment, but that it also promotes selection for undesirable reasons.  Part
Three  then proposes  amendments  to the Department's  prosecutive
guidelines to rectify these problems.
Part Four  raises the  possibility of limited judicial  oversight  of
charging  decisions  in the event the Department  of Justice  does  not
amend its policy.  It suggests that the reasons for judicial reluctance to
review charging decisions generally apply with less force when courts
need  only assess  the rationality of federal prosecutors'  decisions  to
select some eligible offenders for prosecution under federal statutes
that duplicate state criminal prohibitions.
I.  FEDERALIZATION AND DISPARITY
A.  FEDERALIZATION29
Participants  in  the federalization  debate  commonly  define the
process as simply the enactment of federal legislation that allows pros-
ecution in federal court of offenses that the states can also prosecute.30
Although this definition gives a general sense of the process, it focuses
exclusively on Congress' role, ignoring essential judicial contributions.
Both  Congress and the courts  have played a substantial  part in the
expansion of federal criminal law.
1.  Legislative Involvement
Not all federal criminal legislation gives rise to federalization con-
cerns.  First, some federal criminal laws  govern conduct beyond  the
29.  For historical accounts of federalization, see, for example, 2 ENCYCLOPEDIA OF CRIME
AND JUSTCE 775-779 (1983)  [hereinafter ENCYCLOPEDIA]; Baker, supra note 3; Beale, supra
note 6, at 1278-82; Bradley, supra note 3, at 261; Kathleen F. Brickey, Criminal Mischief- The
Federalization of American Criminal Law, 46 HASTNGS  LJ. 1135, 1137-45 (1995);  Maloney,

30.  See, eg., Little, supra note 5, at 1030 n.2 (."Federalization of crime' is a term of art used
... to describe congressional legislation that provides for federal jurisdiction over criminal con-
duct that could also be prosecuted by state or local authorities."); Chippendale, supra note 3, at
455 n.1 (stating that "federalization refers to the creation of federal offenses for criminal acts
amenable to state and local prosecution").
HeinOnline -- 70 S. Cal. L. Rev. 652 1996-19971997] FEDERALIZATION OF CRIMINAL LAW
territorial reach of state laws."  Second, the subject matter of some
federal  criminal  prohibitions  does  not  concern  the  states.  Federal
criminal statutes  that  outlaw treason, 2  conspiracies  to defraud the
United States,33 and efforts to obstruct justice in federal courts34 pro-
hibit conduct  that  harms  the  nation or  federal government  exclu-
sively35 and thus safeguard distinct federal interests that state laws do
not address.36
Third, some federal statutes prohibit conduct that is the same as
or similar to that which state law proscribes but, by definition, protect
distinct federal interests.  For example,  federal law criminalizes  as-
saults on federal agents "while engaged in or on account of the per-
formance  of  official  duties. 37  State  criminal  law  may  prohibit
assaultive conduct generally, but the federal government has a unique
interest in preventing  and punishing assaults on its agents while they
are performing official duties.38  State laws that do not distinguish be-
tween the harm caused by assaults on private citizens and the harm
caused by assaults on federal agents do not safeguard that distinct fed-
eral interest. When such interests are present, the federal government

committed on the high Seas,"  U.S. CONST. art. I, § 8, cl. 10, and to "exercise exclusive Legisla-
tion in all Cases whatsoever" involving certain federal property, id. cl. 17, have enabled Congress
to provide for federal criminal jurisdiction over crimes committed within the "special maritime
and territorial jurisdiction of the United States," 18 U.S.C. § 7 (1994), which sometimes extends
beyond the jurisdiction of individual states.  See, e.g., United States v. Jenkins, 734 F.2d 1322,
1325 (9th Cir. 1983)  (exclusive federal jurisdiction over crime committed on federal military
base), cert. denied, 469 U.S. 1217 (1985).
32.  See 18 U.S.C. § 2381 (1996).
33.  See 18 U.S.C. § 371 (1996).
34.  See, e.g., 18 U.S.C. § 1503 (1996) (jury-tampering in federal cases); § 1510 (obstruction
of federal investigation);  § 1512 (witness-tampering in federal cases); and § 1513 (retaliation
against witnesses, victims, or informants in federal cases).
35.  See Schwartz, supra note 1, at 66-67 (describing "self-defensive" federal crimes as pro-
moting "[i]mportant values in terms of prestige of the central authority").
36.  "Distinct" or "unique" federal interests differ from "important," "significant," or "sub-
stantial" federal interests.  The former terms denote federal interests that are different than
those protected by state laws; the latter terms express the importance of a federal interest,
whether or not states share that interest.
37.  18 U.S.C. § 111(a)(1) (1996) describes the prohibited activity.  18 U.S.C. § 1114 (1996)
lists the federal officers and employees protected by the prohibition.
38.  See United States v. Feola, 420 U.S.  671, 683-84 (1975) (federal statute criminalizing
assaults on federal officers does not require that assailant know that the victim is a federal officer
because Congress may have wanted to provide a federal forum regardless of assailant's knowl-
edge of victim's identity).  See also Van Alstyne, supra note 3, at 1746 (noting that although
states can prosecute counterfeiting  as larceny by trick, "the interest of the United States-to
protect its currency froT debasement-is independent of, and not the same as the state's inter-
est-to protect persons from a species of criminal fraud").
HeinOnline -- 70 S. Cal. L. Rev. 653 1996-1997SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA LAW REVIEW  [Vol. 70:643
has good reason to apply its own substantive and procedural rules and
to control the prosecution in its own courts, even though a state forum
may be available.39  Although enactment of this third category of fed-
eral criminal statutes arguably falls within the definition of federaliza-
tion  because  these  prohibitions  overlap  with  state  criminal  laws,4"
even critics  of federalization  agree  that cases involving distinct  na-
tional or federal interests are properly the subject of federal criminal
41
law.
In contrast, many federal statutes duplicate state laws by prohib-
iting the same or similar conduct and enabling federal prosecutors to
bring  charges to protect interests no different than those that state
laws  address.  Congress  routinely  enacts  such  "duplicative"  federal
legislation.42  For  example,  it  has  passed  laws  that  prohibit  drug
39.  State criminal law may fail to address the distinct harm suffered by the federal govern-
ment or the nation as a whole. For example, state law may impose a punishment that the federal
government would deem insufficient to deter and punish harms to distinct federal interests. See
Feola, 420 U.S. at 684 (asserting that federal prosecution of assaults on federal officers may be
important to "insure uniformly vigorous protection of federal personnel, including those en-
gaged in locally unpopular activity").  In addition:
If genuinely national interests are at stake, the controversies should not have to com-
pete with local breaches of the peace crowding the calendar of a county court of quar-
ter sessions. The judge who determines these controversies should be able to give them
the time and consideration  appropriate to matters of such gravity.  He should be a
specialist in devising solutions that grow out of an understanding of national objectives
and a national point of view. The exigencies of the Department of Justice are also to be
considered.  It is easier to prepare cases for eighty-four district courts, now operating
under uniform rules of criminal procedure, than to conduct proceedings in thousands of
courts operating under scores of procedural codes.

prosecuted in state court).
41.  See LONG RANGE PLAN, supra note 28, at 21 (stating that "[n]o  one seriously disputes
that conduct directly injurious to or affecting the federal government or its agents" should be the
subject of federal law enforcement); Little, supra note 5, at 1036 (noting that federal crimes that
protect unique federal interests "are not the topic of current federalization critiques").
42.  I use the term "duplicative federal legislation" to signify federal criminal statutes that
(1) prohibit the same or similar conduct as state criminal laws and (2) are susceptible to use as a
means of protecting the same interests as state criminal laws. Professor Schwartz uses the term
"auxiliary federal criminal law" to mean roughly the same thing.  See Schwartz, supra note 1, at
70-73.  I prefer the term "duplicative" because Schwartz's terminology suggests that the function
of the overlapping federal law is to assist the states. As I explain later, use of duplicative federal
laws can, in fact, achieve the opposite effect. See infra notes 269-70 and accompanying text. I
refer to federal statutes that prohibit conduct beyond the territorial or substantive reach of state
criminal laws and those that by definition protect interests distinct from those protected by state
law as "nondupicative."

trafficking,43 firearms offenses,"  certain forms of theft and embezzle-
ment,45 arson,46 fraud committed by mail or telephone,47 bank fraud,'
robbery and  extortion,49  fraudulent use of credit  cards,50  and  auto
theft,51  all  of which are subject  to prosecution in state courts.  Re-
cently, Congress has added statutes that prohibit carjacking 2 and do-
mestic violence,53 both of which are also within the purview of state
law.54 Although some duplicative federal crimes require proof of ele-
ments not present in the definition of state crimes, such as a connec-
tion to interstate commerce 5 or use of the mail,56 I demonstrate that
these elements do not ensure that prosecutions are limited to cases
involving unique or significant federal interests.57  To be sure, federal
prosecutors  do employ duplicative  federal statutes in cases that in-
volve distinct federal interests, such as prosecutions of national  and
international fraud and drug conspiracies, but they also can (and often
do) use them when no such federal interests are at stake.8  In short,
there is nothing in the definitions of duplicative federal crimes that
necessarily distinguishes conduct that will subject an offender to state
criminal  charges from conduct which gives rise to analogous federal
charges.59

perceived crime problems, it passes criminal statutes susceptible to broad interpretation that can
be used to prosecute conduct different than that which gave rise to the legislation.  See  eg.,

(2d ed. 1993); Baker, supra note 3, at 500 (discussing "broadly drafted" federal criminal stat-
utes). This phenomena is illustrated by criminal laws passed in response to concerns about or-
ganized crime and racketeering but which do not contain language limiting their application to
those crime problems.  See, e.g., 18 U.S.C. § 894 (1996)  (antiloansharking statute); id. § 1951
(robbery and extortion).  Congress further contributes to federalization  by enacting federal

2.  Judicial Involvement
The enactment of duplicative federal criminal legislation is only
one step in the process of federalization.  The judiciary has also con-
tributed.  First, it has interpreted  the  Constitution,  particularly  the
Commerce Clause, to give Congress substantial latitude to enact fed-
eral criminal legislation.  Second, it has broadly construed the jurisdic-
tional elements  of federal criminal  statutes, allowing  application  of
federal criminal legislation despite the absence of distinct or substan-
tial federal interests.
a.  Constitutionali nterpretation:P erez to Lopez:  Because  Con-
gress lacks a general  police power,60  it must rely on its specifically
enumerated powers to enact federal criminal law.6'  Most commonly,
it relies on its power to regulate interstate commerce.62  Without judi-
cial  blessing  of  congressional  use  of  these  powers,  federalization
cannot occur.  Historically, courts have bestowed such blessings; they
have routinely upheld duplicative federal criminal laws.
Most notably, in Perez v. United States,63 the Supreme Court up-
held a federal criminal antiloansharking law prohibiting collection of
extensions of credit by extortionate means.64 Although enacted under
the Commerce  Clause power, the  antiloansharking  statute does  not
crimes with principal elements that are satisfied by proof of violations of state laws. See, e.g., id.
§§ 1961-62 (federal racketeering statute proven in part by demonstrating "racketeering activity,"
which includes violations of state laws); id. §§ 1956, 1957 (federal money-laundering  statutes
proven in part by demonstrating "specified unlawful activity," which includes violations of state
laws); id. § 1952 (Travel Act prohibits certain travel connected to "unlawful activity," which can
be demonstrated by violations of state law).

63.  402 U.S. 146 (1971).  See generally Stem, supra note 3.
64.  Although the Supreme Court did not cite the specific statute at issue in Perez, the lower
court opinion made clear that the defendant had been prosecuted for violating 18 U.S.C. § 894
(1970).  United States v. Perez, 426 F.2d 1073, 1074 (2d Cir. 1970), affd, 402 U.S. 146 (1971).
Section 894 states in part:
Whoever knowingly participates in any way, or conspires to do so, in the use of any
extortionate means (1) to collect or attempt to collect any extension of credit, or (2) to
punish any person for the nonrepayment thereof, shall be fined under this title or im-
prisoned not more than 20 years, or both.
18 U.S.C. § 891(7) defines "[a]n extortionate means [as] any means which involves the use, or an
express or implicit threat of use, of violence or other criminal means to cause harm to the per-
son, reputation, or property of any person."

FEDERALIZATION OF CRIMINAL LAW
require "that the conduct sought to be regulated have any connection
whatever with commerce. '65  Furthermore, there was no proof that
Perez's loansharking activity-the use of threats to extort increasingly
large interest payments  from  a butcher  who  had borrowed  money
from him-had  any connection  to interstate  commerce.66  Despite
this, the Perez Court concluded that the statute was a constitutional
exercise of the commerce power and could be used to prosecute Perez
because  its enactment  was supported by congressional  findings that
loansharking in the aggregate affected  interstate commerce.67  After
Perez, federal criminal legislation, like other federal regulatory legisla-
tion, benefited from the Court's view that "[e]ven if a particular indi-
vidual's activity has no perceptible interstate effect, it can be reached
by Congress through regulation of that class of activity in general as
long  as  that  class,  considered  as  a  whole,  affects  interstate
commerce."
Perez was an open invitation to Congress to federalize criminal
law.  It enabled Congress to extend federal criminal jurisdiction to any
criminal activity that Congress found to have an effect on interstate
commerce, even where such effect was purely a result of aggregated
instances of local activity.69  Justice Stewart, the lone dissenter in Pe-
rez, noted that the majority's rationale applies to "almost all criminal
activity, be it shoplifting or violence in the streets. '70  Relying on Pe-
rez, lower federal courts have upheld legislation  that allows federal
prosecutions for drug trafficking7' and related offenses,72 participation
in illegal gambling businesses,73 and possession of a machine gun,74
without a requirement that the government prove any connection to
interstate commerce.75

Although  Perez suggested  that Congress  has  almost unlimited
power  to  enact  federal  criminal  legislation  under  the  Commerce
Clause, United States v. Lopez76 recently gave  notice that there are
limits.  In Lopez, the Court assessed the constitutionality of 18 U.S.C.
§ 922(q), a federal law criminalizing the possession of handguns near
schools.77  The statute, like the law upheld in Perez, did not require
the government to prove "that the possession be connected in any way
to interstate commerce. '78  By a 5-4 vote the Court determined that
Congress  exceeded  the  powers  granted  by  the  Commerce  Clause
when it enacted the statute.79
In Lopez, the Court made clear that Congress could regulate a
targeted activity only if it had a substantial effect on interstate com-
merce.8o  Other than this clarification of Commerce  Clause doctrine,
however, the Lopez Court did not question the validity of earlier deci-
sions upholding federal regulations  at the outer  edges  of the com-
merce power, such as the antiloansharking  law in Perez.  Rather, it
found that the challenged gun law was different.  Unlike other federal
regulations  that survived  similar  challenges,  "[s]ection  922(q)  is  a
criminal statute that by its terms has nothing to do with 'commerce'  or
any sort of economic  enterprise, however broadly  one might define

18 U.S.C. § 922(q(1)(A) when Lopez committed the offense. See Lopez, 115 S. Ct. at 1626. The
statute provided that "[i]t shall be unlawful for any individual knowingly to possess a firearm at a
place that the individual knows, or has reasonable cause to believe, is a school zone."  A "school
zone" was defined as the grounds of or within 1,000 feet of the grounds of a school.  See 18
U.S.C. § 921(a)(25).  Violations of the statute were punishable by a prison term of up to five
years, to run consecutive to any other term of imprisonment, and a fine.  See id. § 924(a)(4).
Despite the possible length of the sentence, violations were deemed to be misdemeanors.  See id.
Congress later recodified the statute at 18 U.S.C. § 922(q)(2)(A) (1996).  See infra note 84.

Court had determined to be proper exercises of the Commerce Clause
power, 2 "§  922(q) contains no jurisdictional element which would en-
sure,  through  case-by-case  inquiry,  that  the  firearm  possession  in
question affects ...  [or has] an explicit connection with...  interstate
commerce."83  Finally, the majority noted that there were no findings
in either the legislation  or its legislative history that gun possession
near schools  affects  interstate commerce.84  Much  of the battle be-
tween the majority and dissenting opinions in Lopez is fought over the
persuasiveness of these efforts to distinguish earlier decisions.85
81.  Lopez, 115 S. Ct. at 1630-31.  The Court distinguished the ban on guns near schools
from regulation of commercial activities such as intrastate coal mining, intrastate extortionate
credit transactions, discrimination against potential customers at restaurants and hotels, and pro-
duction and consumption of home-grown wheat-all federal legislation that the Court has up-
held. See Hodel v. Virginia Surface Mining & Reclamation Ass'n, 452 U.S. 264 (1981); Perez v.
United States, 402 U.S. 146 (1971); Katzenbach v. McClung, 379 U.S. 294 (1964); Heart of At-
lanta Motel, Inc. v. United States, 379 U.S. 241 (1964); Wickard v. Filburn, 317 U.S. 111 (1942).
It is not readily apparent why growing and consuming wheat is any more an "economic"  or
"commercial" activity than gun possession. In dissent, Justice Breyer questioned that distinction.
He also contended that neither the race-based exclusion prohibited by the regulation in Mc-
Clung nor the use of force criminalized by the antiloansharking statute in Perez were commercial
activities.  See Lopez, 115 S. Ct. at 1663-64 (Breyer, J., dissenting).
82.  For example, in United States v. Bass, 404 U.S. 336 (1971), the Court tacitly concluded
that former 18 U.S.C. § 1202(a) (repealed 1986), which prohibited felons from "receiv[ing],  pos-
sess[ing], or transport[ing] in commerce or affecting commerce.  ..  any firearm," was a proper
exercise of the commerce power.
83.  Lopez, 115 S. Ct. at 1631.  The Lopez Court also stressed that the definition and en-
forcement of criminal law is a function over which states exercise primary authority.  See id. at
1631 n.3.
84.  See id. at 1631-32.  Conceding that absence of legislative findings alone is not fatal, the
Court nonetheless remarked that such findings "would enable us to evaluate the legislative judg-
ment that the activity in question substantially affected interstate commerce, even though no
such substantial effect was visible to the naked eye ....  Id. at 1632. Congress later amended
the statute, adding such findings.  See id. at 1632 nA. The findings are now codified at 18 U.S.C.
§ 922(q)(1) (1996).  In Lopez, the Court considered only the constitutionality of the prefindings
version of the statute. See Lopez, 115 S. Ct. at 1632 n.4.
85.  For example, Justice Souter criticized the commerciallnoncommercial  distinction as
similar to the now discredited distinction between direct and indirect effects on commerce.  See
Lopez, 115 S. Ct. at 1654 (Souter, J., dissenting) (asking whether majority opinion "does any-
thing but portend a return to the untenable jurisprudence from which the Court extricated itself
almost 60 years ago. The answer is not reassuring."). Justice Souter also contended that because
federal commerce power is plenary, it cannot diminish in force merely because it touches an
area, like criminal law, which is traditionally a state concern.  See id. at 1655.  He also argued
that under rational basis review, the presence of explicit legislative findings may be helpful to the
Court but their absence cannot affect the constitutionality of the statute.  See id. at 1655-56.
Justice Breyer added that there is no "principled distinction" between "commercial"  and "non-
commercial" activities that enables the Court to distinguish Lopez from earlier decisions. Id. at
1663-64 (Breyer, 3., dissenting).

Although the case has received considerable attention, 6 at pres-
ent it appears that Lopez will have little impact on federalization  of
criminal law.87  Lower courts have almost uniformly distinguished Lo-
pez rather than applying it to invalidate criminal laws passed pursuant
to the Commerce Clause.88  Because many duplicative federal crimi-
nal statutes contain the sort of jurisdictional element requiring proof
of  a  connection  to  interstate  commerce  that  18  U.S.C.  § 922(q)
lacked,89 they will survive Lopez.90  Of the few  Commerce  Clause-
dependent federal statutes that do not have such a jurisdictional ele-
ment, the federal drug trafficking prohibition of 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1)
is the most significant.91  It too will weather Lopez.9  Unlike posses-
sion of a gun near a school, drug trafficking is inherently commercial,

criminal sections of federal criminal statutes contain the words "affecting commerce"); Merritt,
supra note 73, at 696 (asserting that many federal statutes require the government to prove a link

a factor the Lopez Court deemed critical to its constitutional analy-
sis.9 Also, like the constitutionally valid statute in Perez, and unlike
3 
the invalid provision in Lopez, section 841(a)(1) is buttressed by con-
gressional findings that even local possession and distribution of drugs
"have a substantial and direct effect upon interstate commerce."94
Nor does Lopez  appear to bar future enactment  of duplicative
federal legislation.  In this regard, perhaps the most significant aspect
of Lopez is what  the Court did not do:  It did not cast immediate
doubt upon the continuing vitality of Perez, but instead it strained to
harmonize its ruling with its earlier decisions.95  Thus, as  long as  a
regulated activity can be characterized as "commercial"  or Congress
includes  a jurisdictional  element requiring proof of a connection to
interstate commerce in its legislation, it seems likely that Congress can
continue to federalize criminal law.96  This is particularly so if Con-
gress buttresses the legislation with findings that the prohibited activ-
ity,  in  the  aggregate,  has  a  detrimental  impact  on  interstate
commerce.97  Ultimately,  Lopez may have less  impact  on constitu-
tional  Commerce  Clause  jurisprudence  than  on  statutory
interpretation.

Lessons In Learning to Love the FederalS entencing Guidelines, 1996 Wis. L. Rlv. 679,740 (stat-

94.  21 U.S.C. § 801(3) (1996).
95.  Lopez repeatedly cites Perez and distinguishes the antiloansharking law from the ban
on guns near schools.  See Lopez, 115 S.C t. at 1629-31; see also Kathleen F. Brickey, The Com-
merce Clause and Federalized Crime: A Tale of Two Thieves, 543 ANNA  S AM. ACAD. PotL &
Soc. Sci. 27,37 (1996) (noting that Lopez "did not overrule a single [Supreme Court] commerce
clause decision").
96.  I use the term "likely" because the Court did not make clear the extent to which the
Commerce Clause makes any single factor that it discusses in Lopez either necessary or suffi-
cient. For a thorough discussion of factors that may have played a role in the Lopez decision and
a means of addressing their importance, see Merritt, supra note 76.
97.  Of course, Lopez may be only the Court's initial assault on Congress' liberal use of the
Commerce Clause, foreshadowing more severe restrictions in the future.  However, such a de-
velopment is unlikely. A significant expansion of Lopez could jeopardize certain economic and
antidiscrimination statutes passed pursuant to the Commerce Clause that have become fixtures
in American society.  See, eg., Katzenbach v. McClung, 379 U.S. 294 (1964); Heart of Atlanta

b.  Statutory interpretationo f jurisdictionale lements: Because ju-
risdictional elements requiring proof of some connection to interstate
commerce are common in federal criminal laws98  and because  Con-
gress may seek to insulate future legislation from Lopez-inspired in-
validation  by  including  such  elements,99  the way  in  which  courts
interpret those elements is critical to federalization  of criminal law.
Restrictive interpretation, requiring proof that the conduct in a partic-
ular case has a significant connection to interstate commerce,  could
operate to limit application of federal statutes to cases involving dis-
tinct or substantial federal interests.  Although the Supreme Court has
given  jurisdictional  elements  some  content,100  both  the  Supreme
Court and lower federal courts have construed them so liberally that
the statutes in which they appear apply to cases in which there are no
distinct or substantial federal interests.
Consider, for example,  a jurisdictional  element that apparently
would have  saved the gun law in Lopez, one "which might limit its
reach to a discrete set of firearm possessions that additionally [would]
have an explicit connection with or effect on interstate commerce." 01
regulations to protect employees).  Justice Thomas seems to be the only member of the Court
inclined to take the narrow Commerce Clause path. See Lopez, 115 S.C t. at 1650 n.8 (Thomas,
J., concurring) ("I might be willing to return to the original [more restrictive] understanding [of
the Commerce Clause].... ."). Two members of the majority, Justices Kennedy and O'Connor,
clearly are unwilling to do so. See id. at 1634,1637 (Kennedy, J., concurring) (characterizing the
holding in Lopez as "necessary though limited"  and noting that Heart of Atlanta, McClung,
Perez, "and like authorities...  are not called in question by our decision today"). The remain-
ing justices who signed the majority opinion appear more intent on warning Congress about the
future than rethinking the past.  "Admittedly, some of our prior cases have taken long steps
down [the] road [to a general federal police power]..,  but we decline here to proceed any
further."  Id. at 1634. See also Brickey, supra note 95, at 37 (describing the Lopez opinion as
"judicial saber rattling").
98.  See supra note 89.
99.  Indeed, Congress recently enacted a criminal prohibition identical to the one that the
Court struck down in Lopez except for the inclusion of a jurisdictional element, requiring that
offenders possess "a firearm that has moved in or that otherwise affects interstate or foreign
commerce...."  18 U.S.C.A. § 922(q)(2)(A) (1996).  See Omnibus Consolidated Appropriations
Act, Pub. L No. 104-208, § 657, 110 Stat. 3009, 369-70 (1997).
100.  See Rewis v. United States, 401 U.S. 808 (1971)  (rejecting interpretation of the Travel
Act, 18 U.S.C. § 1952, which prohibits interstate travel in furtherance of certain criminal activity,
to allow conviction of operators of an illegal lottery merely because customers traveled from
outside of the state to place wagers); United States v. Bass, 404 U.S. 336 (1971)  (interpreting
former 18 U.S.C. app. § 1202(a) to require proof of some interstate commerce connection in
prosecutions for receipt and possession of a firearm by restricted classes of persons).

HeinOnline -- 70 S. Cal. L. Rev. 662 1996-19971997] FEDERALIZATION OF CRIMINAL LAW
Section 922(g), a principal federal firearms law1"  which makes it ille-
gal for certain classes of persons such as convicted felons to possess or
receive firearms or ammunition, contains such an element.103  It pro-
hibits possession of only those firearms or ammunition "in or affecting
commerce,"  and  receipt  if  the firearm  or  ammunition  "has  been
shipped or transported in interstate or foreign  commerce."14  Both
the Supreme  Court and lower courts have interpreted  the "in com-
merce" language to require only that the firearm or ammunition have
traveled in interstate commerce at any time before the defendant re-
ceives or possesses it.105 Thus, federal law criminalizes firearm posses-
sion by prohibited persons except in the unlikely event that the gun,
the ammunition, and the gunpowder106 are all manufactured  in and
have  never  left  the state  in which  the defendant  possesses  them.
102.  Section 922(g) is the result of a merger of its predecessors, 18 U.S.C. app. §§ 1202(a)-
(b) and 18 U.S.C. §922(d),  (g)-(h).  The predecessor statutes were similar but not identical in
coverage.  See Bass, 404 U.S. at 341-42 (describing differences).  In 1986, Congress repealed
§ 1202 and created § 922(g) in its present form as part of the Firearms Owners Protection Act,
Pub. L. No. 99-308,  § 102(6)(D), 100 Stat. 449, 452 (1986); H.R. REP. No. 99-495 (1986), re-
printed in 1986 U.S.C.C.A.N. 1327, 1349. See United States v. Wallace, 889 F.2d 580, 583 (5th
Cir. 1989) (describing history of § 922(g)).  For a thorough discussion of the history of federal
firearms legislation, see United States v. Lopez, 2 F.3d 1342, 1348-60 (5th Cir. 1993), affd, 115 S.
Ct. 1624 (1995).
103.  Section 922(g) also prohibits fugitives from justice, drug users and addicts, persons ad-
judged mentally defective or committed to mental institutions, illegal aliens, persons dishonora-
bly discharged from the Armed Forces, persons who have renounced citizenship, and persons
subject to certain restraining orders from shipping, transporting, and possessing firearms or am-
munition in interstate or foreign commerce. See id. § 922(g)(2)-(8).
104.  Although the "possess" clause of § 922(g) refers only to "commerce," not "interstate
commerce," courts interpret that clause to require a connection between possession and inter-
state or foreign commerce. See Wallace, 889 F.2d at 583; United States v. Gillies, 851 F.2d 492,
493 (1st Cir. 1988).
105.  In dicta in Bass, 404 U.S. at 350, the Court interpreted language in a similar federal
firearms statute, former 18 U.S.C. App. § 1202(a), which precluded felons and others from re-
ceiving a firearm "in commerce or affecting commerce," to allow conviction "if [the prosecution]
demonstrates that the firearm received has previously traveled in interstate commerce."  The
Court acknowledged that "[t]his is not the narrowest possible reading of the statute .... Id. at
350-51.  In Scarborough v. United States, 431 U.S. 563,575 (1977), the Court held that a defend-
ant violates § 1202(a) by possessing a firearm that has traveled in interstate commerce at any
time before possession. The Court recognized that this requires only a "minimal nexus" between
the possession and interstate commerce.  Id. at 577.  In Barrett v. United States, 423 U.S. 212
(1976), the Court held that the prosecution can prove a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(h), a prede-
cessor to § 922(g), by demonstrating that the defendant purchased a firearm that had moved in
interstate commerce at any time before his purchase, even if the movement was simply from the
manufacturer to the dealer who later sold the firearm.  Lower courts have followed that lead
when interpreting § 922(g). See, eg., United States v. Fitzhugh, 984 F.2d 143,146 (5th Cir. 1993);
United States v. Carter, 981 F.2d 645, 648 (2d Cir. 1992); Wallace, 889 F.2d at 583-84; United
States v. McCarty, 862 F.2d 143, 145 (7th Cir. 1988).
106.  The definition of "ammunition" includes "propellent powder designed for use in any
firearm."  18 U.S.C. § 921(a)(17)(A)  (1994).

Although the "in commerce" jurisdictional element means something,
it  doesn't  mean  much.107   The  distinction  between  those  persons
whom the statute reaches and those who fortuitously escape coverage
has nothing to do with any discernible federal interest.08
The same holds true for another commonly used federal jurisdic-
tional element:  the requirement that some aspect of the criminal ac-
tivity  affect  interstate  or  foreign  commerce.109  Relying  on  the
Supreme Court opinions interpreting "affecting  interstate or foreign
107.  See Pollak, supran ote 87, at 549-50 ("The Lopez opinion does not discuss how easy it is
to add the necessary 'jurisdictional element,"' which may be seen as a "lawyers'  gimmick."). The
prosecution could have satisfied such a jurisdictional element in Lopez. The parties stipulated
that a federal agent would testify that the gun had been manufactured outside of Texas.  See
Lopez, 2 F.3d at 1368. Thus, although the Supreme Court was sufficiently troubled by the impli-
cations of a federal prosecution of Lopez that it determined for the first time in almost 60 years
that Congress had exceeded its Commerce Clause powers, apparently it would have affirmed the
conviction had Congress included the virtually meaningless requirement that the government
prove that the gun traveled across state lines at any time before Lopez possessed it. But see
Merritt, supra note 76, at 696 n.88 (contending that the "in commerce" requirement is a mean-
ingful standard).
108.  See United States v. Morales, 902 F.2d 604, 607 (7th Cir. 1990) ("What the federal
interest is in punishing the possession of a firearm by a person convicted of Illinois felonies
escapes us ....  ."); Brickey, supra note 95, at 30 ("In commerce" basis for exercise of federal
jurisdiction "enables the federal government to assert criminal jurisdiction over virtually any
state crime by tacking on marginally relevant jurisdictional elements."); Merritt, supra note 76,
at 717-18 (describing link to interstate commerce as "tenuous" and "weak").
109.  See generally Maloney, supra note 3, at 1796 ("The Commerce Clause has become, in
recent years, the foundation for an expanding federal criminal jurisdiction over intrastate activi-
ties, on the theory that such activities 'affect interstate commerce."').
The Supreme Court has also been generous when construing the "mailing" element of 18
U.S.C. § 1341 (1996), the federal mail fraud statute, which Congress enacted pursuant to the
postal power granted by U.S. CONST. art. I, § 8, cl. 7. The statute, which criminalizes "scheme[s]
devised or intending to defraud or for obtaining money or property by fraudulent means" re-
quires proof of "use or causing the use of the mall in furtherance of the fraudulent scheme."  See
§ 1341; Ellen S. Podgor, Mail Fraud- Opening Letters, 43 S.C. L. Ray. 223, 226 (1992).  In
Schmuck v. United States, 489 U.S. 705, 715 (1989), the Court held that the "in furtherance"
component of the mailing requirement is satisfied if "the mailing is part of the execution of the
scheme as conceived by the perpetrator at the time ..  " Thus, the Court determined that the
statute applied to the defendant's sale of automobiles to retail dealers after he had "rolled back"
the odometers because it was essential to the scheme that the defrauded dealers would mail title
application forms to the state Department of Transportation  after they had purchased the
automobiles. See id. Thus, mailings initiated by the victims after they had been defrauded were
sufficient to satisfy the "mailing" requirement.
Writing for four members of the Court in dissent, Justice Scalia contended that the mail
fraud statute was not meant to create "a general federal remedy against fraudulent conduct, with
the use of the mails as the jurisdictional hook," id. at 722-23, implying that the majority had done
just that. One commentator agrees that the Schmuck Court "effectively has taken the crime well
beyond its post-office origin. The Court has provided prosecutors with a more accessible statute
to use for crimes involving fraud."  See Podgor, supra, at 262-63.
For more on the development of the mail fraud statute and its role as one of the first federal
crimes to duplicate state criminal prohibitions, see Miner, Federal Courts,s upra note 3, at 120-21;

commerce"  as an expression of congressional intent "to exercise its
full power under the Commerce Clause,"110 lower federal courts have
held that proof of even  minimal or  tangential  effects  on interstate

572.  In Stirone v.  United States, 361 U.S.  212 (1960),  the Court interpreted the language
"[w]hoever in any way or degree obstructs, delays, or affects commerce or the movement of any
article or commodity in commerce" in the Hobbs Act, 18 U.S.C. §1951, to "manifest[ ] a purpose
to use all the constitutional power Congress has to punish interference with interstate commerce
by extortion, robbery or physical violence." Id. at 215 (emphasis added). Although the italicized
language does not appear in other federal statutes, the Court has reached the same conclusion
when Congress uses the words "affecting interstate or foreign commerce."
111.  Under Lopez, as a matter of constitutional interpretation, Congress can regulate an
activity pursuant to its Commerce Clause powers only if the activity, if aggregated, has a substan-
tial effect on interstate commerce. See supra note 80 and accompanying text.  However, when
considering whether the facts in a particularc ase satisfy an "affecting commerce" jurisdictional
element in a federal criminal statute, lower federal courts seem satisfied with minimal, as op-
posed to "substantial,"  effects.  See infra notes 112-116 and accompanying  text.  Lopez has
prompted some lower courts to rethink such a generous view of the jurisdictional element.  See
infra note 120 and accompanying text.

because they deplete assets that may have been used in interstate commerce); United States v.
Brown, 959 F.2d 63 (6th Cir. 1992) (robbery of small tavern that purchased goods from distribu-

of jewelry salesman who was carrying property of various businesses involved in interstate com-
merce).  See also Merritt, supra note 76, at 725 ("Courts have readily concluded that extortion or

(7th Cir. 1977) (local tavern sufficient).
Before the Supreme Court decided Russell, some courts gave the arson statute a more re-
stricted reading. See United States v. Mennuti, 639 F.2d 107 (2d Cit. 1981) (no federal jurisdic-
tion over arson of residential property); United States v. Monholland, 607 F.2d 1311 (10th Cir.
1979) (no federal jurisdiction over firebombing of state judge's car).  Post-Russell cases have
questioned whether those earlier decisions survive. See  e.g., Shively, 927 F.2d at 808; Stillvell,
900 F.2d at 1107. But see United States v. Voss, 787 F.2d 393 (8th Cir. 1986) (post-Russell case
finding no federal jurisdiction over residential arson despite insurance coverage from out-of-
state company).
Some courts have concluded that Lopez requires a narrower view of the jurisdictional re-
quirement in the federal arson statute.  See infra note 120.
115.  See  e.g., United States v. Muskovsky, 863 F.2d 1319 (7th Cir. 1988) (interstate tele-
phone calls by prostitution ring to get credit card approval sufficient for federal jurisdiction even
though FBI operated credit card company); United States v. Bagnariol, 665 F.2d 877 (9th Cir.
1981) (minimal effect on interstate commerce sufficient); United States v. Barton, 647 F.2d 224,
233 (2d Cit. 1981) (asserting that the RICO statute "has an even more expansive jurisdictional
predicate than does" the federal arson statute).
116.  See, eg., United States v. Nukida, 8 F.3d 665, 670-72 (9th Cir. 1993) (rejecting require-
ment of substantial effect on interstate commerce for purposes of federal product-tampering
prosecution).  See also United States v. Baker, 82 F.3d 273 (8th Cir.), cert. denied, 117 S. Ct. 538
(1996) (victim's use of ATM machine to obtain money to pay police officer to avoid arrest satis-
fied Travel Act requirement that facility in interstate commerce be used to facilitate extortion
even though transaction triggered an intrastate transfer of funds).  In United States v. Grey, 56
F.3d 1219, 1223-26 (10th Cir. 1995), the court acknowledged that a minimal effect on interstate
commerce is sufficient to satisfy the  "affecting  interstate commerce"  element of 18 U.S.C.
§ 1956, the federal money-laundering statute, but found the evidence insufficient to meet that
low standard.  In cases involving attempts to violate federal law, the mere "realistic probability"
of an effect on interstate commerce is sufficient for federal jurisdiction.  See, e.g., Shields, 999
F.2d at 1098; United States v. Peete, 919 F.2d 1168, 1174-75 (6th Cir. 1990).

United  States  could  in  theory  prosecute  virtually  every  would-be
thief...  no matter how trivial the amount at issue."" 7  That comment
aptly characterizes the insignificance of such jurisdictional elements.
It is  with regard to interpretation  of such elements that Lopez
may have its most pronounced impact."8  Lopez held that in order for
Congress to be able to regulate an activity  by use of its  Commerce
Clause power, the activity must "substantially effect" interstate com-
merce. 19  Because  "affecting  commerce"  jurisdictional  elements ex-
press  the  outer  reach  of  congressional  Commerce -Clause  power,
courts may determine  that the government must prove that the al-
leged criminal activity in individual cases has a substantial effect on
interstate commerce in order to satisfy such jurisdictional elements.20
This  would constitute  a significant change in existing  doctrine, pre-
cluding the federal government from using proof of a minimal affect
on interstate commerce  as  a jurisdictional  hook to support federal
prosecution.
Nonetheless, Lopez is far from an antidote for federalization.' 21
As a matter of constitutional interpretation, it most likely leaves un-
touched existing and future duplicative federal statutes that either in-
clude  jurisdictional  elements  or  pertain  to  activity  that  can  be
characterized as "commercial."  Even if it does lead to narrower statu-
tory  interpretation  of "affecting  commerce"  jurisdictional  elements,
Lopez will not serve as a limit in three of the most significant areas of

principal federal drug statute has no jurisdictional element for courts
to construe more narrowly.'3  The principal federal firearms statute,
18 U.S.C. §922(g), allows for federal prosecution when the firearm has

statutes require proof of an effect on interstate commerce.125
B.  DisPARA-m TREATmENT
Although the substance of federal criminal law has come to dupli-
cate much  of state criminal law, the procedures  that apply  and  the
sentences that convicted defendants receive and serve in the federal
criminal justice system are often far different than those encountered
in state courts.  Notwithstanding  some significant  exceptions,26  de-
fendants typically fare considerably worse when prosecuted in federal
court.  In fact, differences  between federal and state law that favor
federal prosecutions  are most striking in  cases involving frequently
charged duplicative  federal statutes, like drug and firearms prosecu-
tions. As a result, the disparity between federal and state prosecution
122.  See Little, supra note 5, at 1043-46 (contending that much of the concern with federali-
zation involves an increase in federal gun and drug prosecutions); Bowman, supra note 92, at 733
& n.190 (fraud and drug cases make up over half of federal cases).
123.  See 21 U.S.C. §841(a)(1) (1996).
124.  The Court recognizes "three broad categories of activity that Congress may regulate
under its commerce power- ...use of the channels of interstate commerce[,] ...th e instrumen-
talities of interstate commerce, or persons or things in interstate commerce ....[ and] activities
having a substantial relation to interstate commerce."  Lopez, 115 S. Ct. at 1629-30 (citations
omitted).  Lopez applies only to statutes that regulate the third category of activity.  See id.at 
1630.  In a case decided less than a week after Lopez, the Court clearly held that even if there is
insufficient evidence that the criminal activity satisfies an "affecting commerce" requirement in a
federal statute, sufficient proof to satisfy a statutorily defined "alternate criterion" for federal
jurisdiction can sustain a conviction.  See United States v. Robertson, 115 S. Ct. 1732, 1733
(1995)  (per curiam).  Because 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)  (1996) allows for conviction if the gun has
moved in interstate commerce, see supra notes 101-108 and accompanying text, Lopez is likely to
have little if any effect on its application.  See Pappadopoulos,6 4 F.3d at 527-28 (proof that the
gun is an article or good in commerce is sufficient); United States v. Hanna, 55 F.3d 1456, 1462
n.2 (9th Cir. 1995).
125.  The mail fraud statute, 18 U.S.C. § 1341 (1996), is based primarily on the postal power.
The only exception is its application to mailings conducted by private companies, such as the
United Parcel Service, that do business in interstate commerce.  See id.T he wire fraud statute,
18 U.S.C. § 1343 (1996), requires only that the fraud be "transmit[ted] or causes to be transmit-
ted by means of wire, radio, or television communication in interstate or foreign commerce,"
whether or not there is any effect on interstate commerce. The bank fraud statute, 18 U.S.C.
§ 1344 (1996), does not require proof of any connection to interstate commerce.
126.  See infra note 128.
HeinOnline -- 70 S. Cal. L. Rev. 668 1996-19971997] FEDERALIZATION OF CRIMINAL LAW
is a hallmark of federalization.  Without attempting to provide an ex-
haustive list,127 I will describe five ways in which defendants receive
less favorable treatment in federal court than state court.128
First, the Federal Bail Reform Act of 1984 is more likely to result
in pretrial detention without bail than state law.-29  Unlike some state
statutes, federal law allows detention based solely on a prediction of
dangerousness. 30  In addition, unlike state laws, federal law imposes a
rebuttable  presumption  that defendants  charged  with most  federal
drug felonies and some firearms offenses should be detained without
127.  For additional examples, see Beale, supran ote, 2 at 997 & n.70 (discussing "procedural
rights related to joinder, severance, and pretrial discovery"); Jeffries & Gleeson, supra note 54,
at 1103-1125 (describing admissibility of accomplice testimony, investigative powers of federal
grand jury, and ability to use harsh sentences as means of obtaining cooperation).
128.  This comparison is subject to two objections. First, one might question why there
should be concern for those prosecuted in federal court even if there is a difference between
treatment that works to the disadvantage of federally prosecuted defendants. That is, it is possi-
ble to consider federal prosecution to be the "norm" and to conclude that those who escape
federal prosecution are simply lucky. I reject this contention because both historically, see, eg.,
Brickey, supra note 29, at 1172 ("The original role of federal criminal law was auxiliary to that of
the states."), and numerically, see infra notes 176-177 and accompanying text, state prosecution
is the "norm."  Second, a critic could correctly note that in some critical areas, like jury size and
nonunanimity, defense discovery obligations, and sentencing of recidivist felons, state law is less
favorable to criminal defendants than federal law.  Perhaps the most noteworthy example  is
California's "three-strikes-and-you're-out"  statute, requiring draconian sentences for recidivist
felons. If so, why focus on the disadvantages of federal law? My principal reason for doing so is
that federal prosecutors, who typically have more freedom to select a few defendants for prose-
cution than do their state counterparts, see infra Part II.C., can exploit those differences when
choosing which offenders to prosecute in federal court.  If federal law is advantageous, they can
prosecute the case; if not, they can have the state prosecute the case.
129.  The federal law is codified at 18 U.S.C. §§3142-3156  (1996).
130.  The federal bail statute, 18 U.S.C. § 3142(e) (1996), requires pretrial detention if, after
a hearing, a judicial officer finds that no conditions of pretrial release "will reasonably assure...
the safety of any other person and the community."  Although many state bail laws do allow
consideration of future dangerousness, some do not allow consideration of that factor. Cf.Y ALE
KAmnsAR,W AYNE R. LAFAVE & JERALD H. ISRAEL,M ODERN CRIMINAL PRocErnDU  877 (8th
ed. 1994) (reporting that "most [states] permit some consideration of the defendant's dangerous-
ness in the pretrial release determination"). See also BARBARA GoTrLEB, PuBLiC DANGER AS
A FACTOR IN PRETRIAL RELEASE: A  COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF STATE LAWS (1985); Michael
W. Youtt, Note, The Effect of Salerno v. United States on the Use of State Preventive Detention
Legislation:A   New Definitiono f Due Process,2 2 GA. L. REv. 805,810-811 (1988).  Some of the
states that do allow consideration of dangerousness require that the defendant first have a prior
conviction or be on pretrial release, probation, or parole at the time of the subject offense.  See
id.at  811-12.  Federal law contains no such restriction.
Of course, in those states that do not have statutes that specifically allow pretrial detention
based on a finding of dangerousness, judges may nonetheless consider dangerousness when set-
ting bail.  See CHARLES H. WmTEBREAD & CMUSToPERn SLOBOGIN, CRIMINAL PROCEDURE
§20.03 (3d ed. 1993); Thomas E. Scott, PretrialD  etention Under the Bail Reform Act of 1984: An
Empirical Analysis, 27 AM. CRiM. L. REv. 1, 7 (1989) (discussing judges setting high bails for
dangerous felons and recidivists as a method of achieving "sub rosa detention").

bail as both dangers to the community and flight risks.131 These differ-
ences likely account, in part, for the fact that in 1992, approximately
fifty percent of federal drug trafficking  defendants were detained or
unable to post bail pending disposition of their cases132 compared to
thirty-five  percent  of  drug  trafficking  defendants  charged  in  state
courts in the seventy-five largest counties. 33  The increased likelihood
of pretrial incarceration in federal court is significant for a variety of
reasons other than the loss of liberty.  It can hamper efforts to prepare
for trial and may cause a defendant to serve most or all of his sentence
without being found guilty." 4
Second, federal law often gives defendants less access to pretrial
discovery than does state law.'35 The law governing disclosure of wit-
ness statements is a telling  example.  Under the federal Jencks Act,
the prosecution need only disclose existing verbatim, substantially ver-
batim, or adopted statements of those witnesses who actually testify at
trial and need not do so until after the witness has testified on direct
examination. 6  In noncapital cases, the defendant has no right to a
131.  Section 3142(e) states that "it shall be presumed that no condition or combination of
conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and the safety of the
community if the judicial officer finds that there is probable cause to believe that the person"
committed a drug trafficking crime carrying a maximum sentence of 10 years or more or a viola-
tion of 18 U.S.C. § 924(c), a federal statute criminalizing the use or carrying of a firearm during a
crime of violence or drug trafficking offense.  See 18 U.S.C. § 3142(e) (1996).  Unless rebutted,
the presumption requires detention.  See id. Almost all federal drug trafficking crimes carry
maximum sentences of 10 or more years, thus triggering the rebuttable presumption.  See 21
U.S.C. §§ 841(b), 960 (1996).
State statutes do not contain such presumptions.  See KAMIsAR ET AL., supra note 130, at
877 (noting that "only a few states have adopted..,  a full.scale preventive detention scheme"
like the federal government).
132.  See OFFICE OF JusrncE PROGRAMS, U.S.  DEP'T OF JUsricm, SOURCEBOOK  OF CRIMI-
NAL JusncE STATISTICS  1995, at 460 tbl.5.11 (1995)  [hereinafter SOURCEBOOK].  Of these de-
fendants, 41% were detained; 9.3% were unable to post bail.  See id.
133.  See id. at 511, tbl. 5.65.  Of these defendants, 5% were detained; 30% could not post
bail.  See id  The differences in federal and state law may not be the only explanation for the
higher detention  rate in federal court, however.  The severity  of offenses committed  and
problems of overcrowding  in state pretrial detention facilities may also play a role in the
disparity.
134.  For a discussion of the various costs to the accused of pretrial detention, see Barker v.
Wingo, 407 U.S. 514, 532-33 (1972); S-EPmEN A. SALTZBURG  & DANmL J. CAPRA, AMERICAN
CRIMIAL PROCEDURE 728-29 (5th ed. 1996).
135.  See K~misAR ErAL., supra note 130, at 1234 (describing the "ABA Model" adopted by
some states that is "considerably broader" than the "Federal Model" with respect to defense
discovery).
136.  The Jencks Act, which is codified at 18 U.S.C. § 3500 and Rule 262 of the Federal
Rules of Criminal Procedure, allows discovery of witness statements only after a witness has
testified on direct examination. See 18 U.S.C. § 3500(b); FED. R. Crit.  P. 26.2(a).  The Act also

witness list before trial.'37  Even if the defendant can identify potential
government witnesses, the witnesses have no obligation to give inter-
views.138  In marked contrast, some states allow the defense to take
pretrial depositions of potential prosecution witnesses.139
Third, federal law often provides defendants with fewer opportu-
nities for suppression of evidence  as a result of constitutional viola-
tions than does  state law.  While  the Burger and Rehnquist  Courts
have interpreted constitutional doctrines requiring suppression of evi-
dence narrowly,'40  numerous state courts have construed their consti-
tutions more broadly, conferring rights that the Supreme Court does
not recognize  and requiring  suppression  where  the Supreme  Court
does not.141  For example, various state doctrines are more favorable
to defendants concerning  what constitutes  a "seizure";142 whether a
employs a definition of "statement"  that includes only verbatim, substantially verbatim, and
adopted statements.  See 18 U.S.C. § 3500(e) (1996); FED. R. CGRM. P. 26.2(0.

surface in prosecutions involving drugs and guns.  Investigations into
drug  and  firearms  offenses  frequently  involve  techniques,  such  as

Fourth, several  aspects of federal sentencing law make federal
prosecution less favorable to defendants.  Although there are signifi-
cant variations in state sentencing schemes, some generalizations are
possible.  Federal  law often allows  greater  maximum  sentences  for
drug trafficking.159  In addition, some federal laws, most notably those
dealing with drug trafficking and weapons offenses, require imposition
of harsh statutory mandatory minimum sentences160 which can be as
long or longer than the maximum sentences  permitted under some
state laws.161  Federal law permits execution of offenders who commit
certain  crimes in  states  that do  not authorize  a  death  penalty  for
analogous offenses.162  The federal sentencing guidelines also require
that judges increase sentences, often dramatically, based upon proof
that the defendant  engaged in uncharged relevant conduct.' 63  Evi-
dence of that uncharged conduct may come in the form of hearsay and
without many of the procedural  protections available at trial.164  Fi-
nally, the federal  sentencing  guidelines  constrict  sentencing judges'
159.  See OFmcE OF JUSTIcE PROGRAMS, U.S. DEP'T OF JUsTICE, DRuGs, CRIME, AND TH
JusrIcE SYsrMF: A NATIONAL REPORT 179-180 (1992) [hereinafter DRuos AND CRME] (listing
maximum sentences for drug offenses in state and federal courts).
160.  See, ag., 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1) (1996) (requiring mandatory consecutive sentences from
5 to 30 years for various firearms violations); 21 U.S.C. § 841(b) (1996)  (requiring mandatory
sentences from 5 years to life for drug trafficking offenses).  Many states do not have mandatory
minimum sentencing laws.  See U.S. SENTENCING COMMN, COCANE AN  FEDERAL SENTErNc.
ING POLICY 136-37 tbl.4 (1995) [hereinafter CoCANE AND FEDERAL SENTENCING POLICY].
161.  Federal law generally requires a minimum ten-year term of imprisonment for first-time
offenders who possess a certain quantity of drugs.  See 21 U.S.C. § 841(b).  But cf. 18 U.S.C.
§ 3553(f) (1996) (establishing a limited "safety valve" allowing first-time offenders who attempt
to cooperate with the government to avoid the imposition of mandatory minimum sentences).
In contrast, some states have maximum sentences shorter than ten years.  See DRuGS  AND
CRuE, supra note 159, at 179-80.
162.  See Brickey, supra note 29, at 1166-67.
163.  For example, U.S. SENTENCIrCN  GuIDELNm  MANUAL  § 1B1.3(a)(2)  (1995),  defines
"relevant conduct" to include acts committed by the defendant or co-conspirators "that were
part of the same course of conduct or common scheme or plan as the offense of conviction."
Such "relevant conduct" increases the "offense level" used to determine the defendant's sen-
tence in the  same  manner as  conduct  for which the  defendant  has been  convicted.  Id.
§ 1B1.3(a).  See also Bowman, supran ote 92, at 702-04 (explaining relevant conduct provisions).
The federal guidelines sometimes require federal courts to increase defendants' sentences based
on conduct that resulted in acquittal.  See United States v. Watts, 117 S. Ct. 633 (1997).
164.  See Gerald W. Heaney, The Reality of Guidelines Sentencing: No End to Disparity, 28
AM. Cium. L. REv. 161,208-220 (1991); Susan N. Herman, The Tail That Wagged the Dog: Bifur-
cated Fact-FindingU  nder the FederalS entencing Guidelines and the Limits of Due Process, 66 S.
CAL. L. Rnv. 289, 289-92 (1992).  Unlike federal law, numerous states have guidelines systems
that "reject routine sentence enhancements based on unconvicted, 'real-offense' factors."  Rich-

ability to consider certain types of mitigating evidence.165  Although
some states have also adopted guideline regimes, they provide signifi-
cantly more flexibility  than the federal system and have less severe
results. 66
Fifth,  defendants  frequently  serve  a  greater  portion  of  the
sentences  imposed in federal court.  Under federal law, there is no
parole eligibility.  Even with full credit for good behavior in prison, a
federally prosecuted  defendant must serve eighty-five percent of the
sentence imposed.167  In contrast, as a result of parole eligibility and
good time credit, inmates sentenced to state prisons in 1992 will serve
only thirty-eight percent of the sentences imposed. 68  State defend-
ants imprisoned for drug trafficking will serve only a third of their
sentences.69
I.  FEDERAL PROSECUTORS  AND EQUAL PROTECTION
Federal prosecutors are the footsoldiers of federalization.  Armed
with congressionally created and judicially blessed duplicative crimi-
nal statutes, they bring charges in numerous cases that could be prose-
cuted in state courts.'70  For example, of the defendants whose federal
cases terminated in acquittals, convictions, or dismissals in i994, 9228
165.  See U.S. SENTENCING  GunELnqES MANuAL §§ 5H1.1-5H1.12  (1995).
166.  See Frase, supra note 164, at 123-24.
167.  Under 18 U.S.C. § 3624(b) (1996), a defendant may reduce his sentence by 54 days per
year by complying with institutional regulations.

Thirty states retain indeterminate sentencing schemes that allow for early release on parole. See
COCAINE  AND FEDERAL SENTENCING POUCY, supra note 160, 136-37 tbl. 4.  Congress has en-
couraged states to impose longer sentences on defendants convicted of certain violent offenses
and to require that such defendants serve a larger portion of their sentences by linking the avail-
ability of federal grants for prison construction to state enactment of harsher sentencing regimes.
See 42 U.S.C. §§ 13701-13704 (1994).
169.  See LANGAN & GRA:zmDBi, supra note 168, at 4 tbl.4 (34% of sentence imposed). See
also COCAINE AND FEDERAL SENTENCING  Poucy, supra note 160, at 143 ("[A]ecording to the
Department of Justice, state courts in 1988 sentenced drug traffickers to an average maximum
sentence of 66 months in prison.  Of the maximum 66 months, the Department of Justice Bureau
of Statistics estimated that, on average,  20 months,  or roughly 30  percent, were  actually
served.").
170.  In 1980, after studying the charging practices of the United States Attorney's Office for
the Northern District of Illinois, Professor Frase concluded that "[flederal prosecutors appear to
give as much or more attention to offenses that are also prosecutable, at least in theory, by state
and local prosecutors" as they do to "crimes with no direct state counterpart."  Richard S. Frase,

were charged with violations of the principal federal drug trafficking
statute,171 3911  were  charged  with  violations  of  federal  firearms
laws,172 and 3281 were  charged under federal mail,  wire, and bank
fraud1 73 statutes.174  These  statutes  duplicate  the  coverage  of state
drug, firearms, and theft laws.  Although prosecution under duplica-
tive federal statutes constitutes a substantial portion of federal prose-
cutors' caseloads,175 most offenders who are eligible for both federal
and state prosecution are charged in state court.176  Indeed, federal
prosecutors lack the resources to bring charges in more than a small
percentage of such cases.177
As a result of the disparity between state and federal procedural
and sentencing regimes, much is at stake when federal prosecutors de-
termine which offenders to charge in federal court.  Federal prosecu-
tors'  selection  decisions  are  made  more  significant  by  the  high
conviction rate in federal court178 and the rigid determinative federal
(1996); Merritt, supra note 76, at 708 ("Overlapping state and federal offenses give federal prose-
cutors unfettered power to decide which defendants will be prosecuted under federal law and
which will be left to state law.").

176.  See Gorelick & Litman, supra note 4, at 973 (stating that the Department of Justice
prosecutes "only a small percentage of conduct falling under federal criminal legislation").  For
example, of all felony convictions in 1992, 12.8% of defendants charged with weapons offenses,
9.3%  charged with drug trafficking, and 20.4% charged with fraud were prosecuted in federal
court. See SOURCEBOOK, supra note 132, at 497 tbl.5.45.
177.  In 1994, there were 4099 federal prosecutors, see U.S. SENENaiNo  CoWN'N ANNUAL

cases in state courts. See BRLAN J.O sTRoM & NEAL B. KAUDER, ExAMIsm-o  THE WORK OF
STATE CoURTs 45 (1995) (providing graph showing felony cases filed in 1993 in general jurisdic-

assistant prosecutors  handling  cases in state and local courts.  See CAROL J.D EFRANCES,

178.  According  to the Administrative Office of United States Courts, of those federally
prosecuted criminal defendants whose cases were disposed of in the 12-month period ending
September 30, 1994, over 83% were convicted by guilty plea or trial.  See L. RALPH MECHAM,

sentencing  rules.179  Because  of the  relative certainty  of conviction
and harsher  sentencing, from an offender's  perspective, the federal
prosecutor's decision to bring federal charges may be the single most
important  decision  that  any  actor  in  the  criminal  justice  system
makes.80  Defendants chosen for federal prosecution bear the brunt
of  federalization,  losing  procedural  protections  and  receiving  and
serving longer sentences.
The significance of selection decisions has not escaped the atten-
tion of some offenders  chosen for federal prosecution.  Defendants
have raised a variety of unsuccessful challenges to their federal prose-
cutions  and resulting  sentences.81  Because  they contend that they
179.  See Bowman, supra note 92, at 717-18 (describing predictability of ultimate sentence
under federal sentencing regime).
180.  See United States v. Redondo-Lemos, 955 F.2d 1296, 1298 (9th Cir. 1992) ("Because
serious drug trafficking crimes often carry mandatory minimum sentences, the crime with which
the [offenders] are charged normally determines the punishment they will suffer. As a practical
matter, then, the charging decision winds up being the only decision that matters.").
181.  Three claims are common:  (1) that referral from law enforcement officials for federal
prosecution without written, reviewable standards violates due process; (2) that more severe
federal prosecution violates equal protection; and (3) that the disparity between federal and
state sentences warrants a downward departure under the sentencing guidelines.  Federal appel-
late courts have uniformly rejected these contentions. See, eg., United States v. Oakes, 11 F.3d
897, 898-99 (9th Cir. 1993) (apparently random selection of defendant for federal prosecution
and mandatory five-year sentence for growing marijuana when state prosecution would have
required only 0-90 days imprisonment did not violate equal protection); United States v. Jacobs,
4 F.3d 603, 604-05 (8th Cir. 1993) (federal prosecution precluding possibility of parole or proba-

See, e.g., United States v. Williams, 746 F. Supp. 1076 (D. Utah 1990) (holding that referral for
federal prosecution without benefit of neutral, written guidelines violated due process when fed-
eral conviction required substantially harsher sentence), rev'd, 963 F.2d 1337 (10th Cir. 1992).
Some defendants raise extra-legal challenges.  For example, federal prisoners have created
"major disturbances" because of dissatisfaction with disparities between their sentences  and
sentences that they would have received in state court.  See U.S. Dep't of Justice, Overlapping
and Separate Spheres: A 'Three-Branch Round Table on State and Federal Jurisdiction 90-91
(Mar. 7, 1994) (transcript, on file with the Southern California Law Review).
Defendants prosecuted in the federal district court in Washington, D.C., have raised similar
claims based on the ability of the United State's Attorney's office there, which prosecutes in
both federal court and District of Columbia Superior Court, to select the forum and thus which
law will apply. That office's practice of selecting some defendants for harsher treatment in fed-
eral district court is described in detail in United States v. Mills, 726 F. Supp. 1359 (D.D.C. 1989),
rev'd, 964 F.2d 1186 (D.C. Cir. 1992) (en bane).
182.  Due process challenges miss the mark because the decision to file charges in federal
court rather than state court alone works no deprivation of a protected interest, a prerequisite
for a due process violation. See Board of Regents v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564, 569-70 (1972).  Rather,
it only subjects the defendant to federal adjudicative procedures, which presumably provide
whatever process is due before subjecting a defendant to a deprivation. Although federal proce-
dures may be less advantageous and federally imposed deprivations more severe than those that
a defendant would experience in state court, if each complies with due process in its own right,
the differences  between federal and state procedures do not make selection of the former a
cognizable deprivation. Cf. M.L.B. v. S.LJ., 117 S. Ct. 555, 566 (1996) (claim that state cannot
require an indigent to pay a fee to appeal termination of parental rights fits the equal protection
framework better than due process because there is no independent right to appeal).
Motions for departures from the sentencing guidelines are only available in atypical cases
involving factors that the Sentencing Commission did not contemplate when drafting the guide-
lines.  See 18 U.S.C. § 3553(b) (1994); U.S. SENTENciN G GumEuirNs MANUAL 5 (1995).  See also
Koon v. United States, 116 S. Ct. 2035, 2044 (1996).  Although the Supreme Court recently
HeinOnline -- 70 S. Cal. L. Rev. 678 1996-19971997] FEDERALIZATION OF CRIMINAL LAW
failed to recognize or acknowledge it, equal protection requires prose-
cutors to have a rational basis for distinguishing between those who
are prosecuted and those who are not.  This constitutional obligation
has  particular  significance  when federal  prosecutors  bring  charges
under duplicative federal statutes against only a small portion of eligi-
ble offenders.  Even if courts refrain from enforcing the equal protec-
tion rationality requirement, federal prosecutors should comply with
it.
A.  EQUAL PROTECTION
Equal protection doctrine "is essentially a direction that all per-
sons similarly situated should be treated alike"1'83 by the government.
It requires that both federallm and state officials185 have a valid rea-
son for treating people differently than others who appear to be simi-
larly situated.186  Courts faced with equal protection claims determine
whether the government's disparate treatment of some persons "tram-
mels fundamental personal rights or is drawn upon inherently suspect
approved of a downward departure based in part on the fact that defendants were prosecuted in
federal court following acquittals and a hung jury in a lengthy, highly publicized state court trial,
see id. at 2053, that situation is atypical.  See supra note 7.  In contrast, federal-state disparities
are hardly atypical and likely were known to the Sentencing Commission.
183.  City of Clebume v. Cleburne Living Ctr., Inc., 473 U.S. 432,439 (1985) (citing Plyler v.
Doe, 457 U.S. 202,216 (1982)).  The Equal Protection Clause provides that "[njo State shall ...
deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws."  U.S. CONsT. amend.
XIV, §1.
184.  Although the Equal Protection Clause is located in the Fourteenth Amendment, which
applies only to the states, the Supreme Court has determined that the Due Process Clause of the
Fifth Amendment imposes similar restrictions on the federal government.  See, eg., Wayte v.
United States, 470 U.S. 598, 608 n.9 (1985); Boiling v. Sharpe, 347 U.S. 497 (1954).  The Court
appears to have adopted the view that the amendments provide identical protection and that
federal and state classifications are subject to the same level of scrutiny.  See Adarand Const.,
Inc. v. Pena, 115 S. Ct. 2097 (1995) ("[A]U1 racial classifications, imposed by whatever federal,
state or local government actor, must be analyzed by a reviewing court under strict scrutiny.").
Of course, the Court may apply differential levels of review to classifications other than those
based on race, but after Adarand that seems unlikely. See generally Kenneth L. Karst, The Fifth
Amendment's Guaranteeo  f Equal Protection, 55 N.C. L. Rv. 541 (1977).
185.  The requirement applies to administrative actors, as well as legislators.  Se4 e.g., Alle-
gheny Pittsburg Coal Co. v. County Comm'r of Webster County, 488 U.S. 336 (1989) (requiring
state tax assessor to make rational distinctions when assessing value of taxpayers' properties);
Wayte v. United States 470 U.S. 598 (1985)  (prohibiting federal prosecutors from selecting per-
sons for prosecution because of their exercise of First Amendment rights); Yick Wo v. Hopkins,
118 U.S. 356 (1886) (holding that equal protection prevented the local board of supervisors from
discriminatory distribution of licenses for the operation of laundries in wooden buildings).
186.  Typically the valid reason will demonstrate that, despite appearances, those who re-
ceive differential treatment are different in some critical respect and thus not "similarly situ-
ated." For a discussion of the meaning of "similarly situated," see Applegate, supra note 28, at
48-54; infra notes 388-89 and accompanying text.

distinctions  such  as race, religion,  or alienage ....  187  If so, courts
subject the discriminatory classification to "strict scrutiny" and find it
unconstitutional unless it is narrowly tailored to achieve a compelling
governmental interest.188  If a classification does not implicate a sus-
pect  class  or fundamental  right,  courts  apply  less  rigorous  review,
often simply asking whether the classification is rationally related to a
legitimate governmental end.189  If there is no rational reason, the dis-
parate treatment is unconstitutional' 90°  In some situations,  such as
those involving gender  discrimination,  courts  apply  a  "heightened"
standard of review less exacting than strict scrutiny but more search-
ing than rational relationship review.'9'
Although the Court has had difficulty achieving consensus on the
precise nature of the rational relationship requirement,192 it is settled
law that the requirement is deferential and not meant to serve as "'a
license for courts to judge the wisdom, fairness, or logic'  of govern-
mental  classifications.193  Thus,  imperfect  classifications  will  survive
review so long as they bear some rational relationship to a legitimate

priate to enforce the mandate of equal protection by requiring the State to demonstrate that its

arrogant legal scholar would not claim that [the eleven cited Supreme Court decisions applying
the rational relationship test] applied a uniform or consistent test under equal protection princi-
ples.").  For example, when the Court applies the rational relationship test to determine the
constitutionality of legislative classifications, sometimes it hypothesizes reasons supporting the
challenged classification scheme. See, eg., Burlington N. R.R. Co. v. Ford, 504 U.S.  648, 652

corporate defendants incorporated in that state than corporate defendants  incorporated out of
state are justified by greater inconvenience that defending distant lawsuit will create for resident

given for the classification.  See, eg., Cleburne, 473 U.S.  at 448-50 (assessing the city council's
reasons  for the  classification scheme,  as found by the lower federal court).  See generally

B.  CHARGING DECISIONS AND  SELECTIVE PROSECUTION
DocrRINE
1.  The ProhibitionA  gainst Discriminatory Charging Decisions
Although the Supreme  Court is loath to constrain prosecutors'
charging descretion,200 it has concluded that the Constitution imposes
some restrictions,  including  those mandated by equal protection.201
When determining  whether a charging  decision  runs afoul  of equal
protection, courts  employ  "selective  prosecution"  doctrine202 which
prohibits prosecutors from bringing charges because of an offender's
race, religion, or other suspect characteristic, or in response to an of-
fender's exercise of a constitutional right, even if there is evidence to
support  the charges.203  These  prohibitions  are  consistent  with  the
claim due to state's inadvertent scheduling error which set conference past time deadline pre-
scribed by state statute violated equal protection). See also infra notes 293-94 and accompanying
text.
200.  See, e.g., Bordenkircher v. Hayes, 434 U.S. 357,364 (1978) ("[S]o long as the prosecutor
has probable cause to believe that the accused committed an offense defined by statute, the
decision whether or not to prosecute, and what charge to file or bring before a grand jury, gener-
ally rests entirely in his discretion.") (footnote omitted).
201.  See, eg., Oyler v. Boles, 368 U.S.  448, 456 (1962).  Due process also limits charging
discretion, preventing prosecutors from increasing charges in retaliation for a defendant's exer-
cise of a litigation-related right.  See, eg., Blackledge v. Perry, 417 U.S.  21 (1974).  But see
Bordenkircher,4 34 U.S. at 357 (allowing a prosecutor to file additional charges when a defend-
ant refuses to plead guilty and instead exercises his right to go to trial).
202.  Selective prosecution doctrine is not limited to cases that are at issue here, those in
which the federal government brings charges under duplicative federal statutes.  Prosecutors
make a variety of other types of charging decisions that the doctrine addresses.  For example, it
applies when federal prosecutors decide which offenders to charge under nonduplicative federal
statutes. See, e-g., Wayte v. United States, 470 U.S. 598 (1985) (selecting only some draft nonre-
gistrants for prosecution under federal Selective Service laws).  It also applies when state prose-
cutors choose to prosecute some offenders but not others.  See Twvo  Guys From Harrison-
Allentown, Inc. v. McGinley, 366 U.S. 582 (1961)  (involving allegations of selective enforcement
of Sunday closing laws). These sorts of decisions are referred to as "screening decisions"--prose-
cutors "screen" offenders to be prosecuted from those who are not.
The doctrine also applies to other types of charging decisions such as the determination
which of several offenses to charge, see United States v. Batchelder, 442 U.S. 114 (1979) (prose-
cutor's decision to select one of two applicable federal statutes), and the decision whether to file
charges that require enhanced sentences based on the nature of an offense or a defendant's
criminal record.  See,  e.g.,  Oyler v. Boles, 368 U.S.  448  (1962)  (decision  whether to seek
mandatory life sentence for habitual offenders). For a general discussion of the different types of
charging decisions, see Vorenberg, supra note 28, at 1524-32.
203.  In Yick Wo v. Hopkins, 118 U.S. 356 (1886), the Court held that the equal protection
ban on improper discriminatory classifications applies to administrators, as well as legislators.
That decision set the stage for the imposition of the same restriction on prosecutors' charging
decisions. In Ylck Wo, a board of supervisors' racially discriminatory distribution of licenses for
laundries in wooden buildings led to prosecution of only Chinese laundry operators for zoning
code infractions. The Court determined that these procedures violated equal protection. When
HeinOnline -- 70 S. Cal. L. Rev. 682 1996-19971997] FEDERALIZATION OF CRIMINAL LAW
"strict"  and  "heightened"  scrutiny  branches  of  equal  protection-
there is never a legitimate, much less a compelling, reason for prose-
cuting a person because of his race, religion, gender, or exercise of a
constitutional  right.  Most courts  assume  that a defendant  who  can
prove that he has been a victim of this sort of discriminatory selective
prosecution is entitled to dismissal of the indictment or reversal of his
conviction.2"  Although theoretically stringent, the prohibition on dis-
criminatory selective prosecution is largely meaningless in practice be-
cause courts require that a defendant raising such a claim prove both
discriminatory  effect and discriminatory  intent, burdens that are all
but impossible to satisfy.205
the Court later upheld the rejection of a request for injunctive relief to prevent the allegedly
selective enforcement of a Sunday closing law in Two Guys from Harrison-Allentown, 366 U.S.
at 582 (1961), it noted that a defense of discriminatory prosecution would be available if the
plaintiff were to be charged.  "Since appellant's employees may defend against any such pro-
ceeding that is actually prosecuted on the ground of unconstitutional discrimination, we do not
believe that the court below was incorrect in refusing to exercise its injunctive powers at that
time."  Id. at 588-89. In Oyler v. Boles, 368 U.S. 448 (1962), the Supreme Court first addressed
the merits of a criminal defendant's claim that a prosecutor's charging decision violated equal
protection.  Although it found no violation in that case, the Court made clear that a charging
decision "deliberately based upon an unjustifiable standard such as race, religion, or other arbi-
trary classification" would run afoul of equal protection.  See id.at  456.  In Wayte v.  United
States, 470 U.S. 598 (1985), the Court concluded that a charging decision based on an offender's
exercise of a constitutional right, such as the Frst Amendment right to protest government pol-
icy, would be unconstitutional.
204.  See, eg., United States v. Falk, 479 F.2d 616 (7th Cir. 1973) (en banc); United States v.
Steele, 461 F.2d 1148 (9th Cir. 1972); United States v. Crowthers, 456 F.2d 1074 (4th Cir. 1972).
Although the courts in those cases reversed convictions as a remedy, presumably they would
have dismissed  the indictments had they made the same findings before  trial began.  The
Supreme Court has yet to rule on whether dismissal is warranted.  See United States v. Arm-
strong, 116 S.C t. 1480, 1484 n.2 (1996) ("We have never determined whether dismissal of the
indictment, or some other sanction, is the proper remedy if a court determines that a defendant
has been the victim of prosecution on the basis of his race.").
205.  Ah Sin v. Wittman, 98 U.S. 500 (1905), demonstrates that equal protection challenges
require proof of discriminatory effect, that is, that the administrative actor has treated similarly
situated others differently.  In Ah Sin, the Court rejected a habeas corpus challenge which al-
leged that a sheriff had enforced a local antigambling ordinance in a manner that discriminated
against Chinese because the petitioner failed to prove that others were violating the ordinance
but not being prosecuted.  See also Armstrong, 116 S.C t. at 1487; McClesky v. Kemp, 481 U.S.
279, 356-59 (1987) (Blackmun, J., dissenting). In Wayte, the Court reiterated the discriminatory
effect requirement and held that a claimant also must prove discriminatory intent. "[E]qual pro-
tection standards ...r equire petitioner to show both that the [government's] enforcement sys-
tem had a discriminatory effect and that it was motivated by a discriminatory purpose." 470 U.S.
at 608 (footnote omitted).  Equal protection doctrine imposes the same requirement in other
contexts. See Washington v. Davis, 426 U.S. 229 (1976).
The need to prove discriminatory effect and intent has been described as "an impossibly
high burden of proof on defendants attempting to raise claims of selective prosecution in the
racial context."  Note, Developments in the Law: Race and the Criminal Process, 101 HARv. L.
Rav. 1472, 1542 (1988)  (footnote omitted) [hereinafter Developments]. See also Barry Lynn

2.  The Requirement of Rational Charging Decisions
In contrast to the clear prohibition against discriminatory charg-
ing decisions, courts have been markedly less certain about whether
selective prosecution doctrine incorporates the  "rationality" compo-
nent of equal protection-whether it requires that prosecutors' charg-
ing decisions, like other governmental actors' decisions, be rationally
related to a legitimate objective.205  When addressing equal protection
challenges to federal prosecutors'  decisions to bring charges under du-
plicative federal statutes, appellate courts frequently take one of two
approaches.  Some tacitly deny the existence  of a rational basis  re-
quirement by articulating a selective prosecution standard that applies
only if there is proof of discrimination based on a suspect characteris-
tic or exercise of constitutional rights.207  In other words, these courts
Creech, Note, And Justice ForA ll: Wayte v. United States and the Defense of Selective Prosecu-
tion, 64 N.C. L. Rav. 385, 408 (1986) ("Because the government is not likely to announce pub-
licly its intent to discriminate and defendants are not generally entitled to discovery until they
have made a prima facie case, defendant will rarely succeed in demonstrating that their prosecu-
tion was motivated by a discriminatory purpose.") (footnote omitted).
206.  Under the Court's multitiered approach to equal protection, charging decisions do not
merit strict or heightened scrutiny. Although the decision to prosecute may ultimately result in
an offender's loss of life or liberty-fundamental interests that typically trigger strict scrutiny-
charging decisions alone do not burden those interests.  They only subject selected offenders to
procedures that may result in a loss of life or liberty.
207.  For example, in United States v. Jacobs, 4 F.3d 603 (8th Cir. 1993), the court concluded:
Jacobs does not assert that the decision to prosecute him in federal forum was based
upon an improper motive such as race, gender, national origin, religious beliefs, or
political affiliation.  Likewise, he does not allege that the prosecution was retalitory or
vindictive in nature.  Accordingly, there is no merit to his contention that the federal
prosecution violated his Fifth Amendment rights.
Id. at 605 (citations omitted).  See also United States v. Morehead, 959 F.2d 1489,1499 (10th Cir.
1992) ("In the absence of proof that the choice of forum was improperly motivated or based on
an impermissible classification as a matter of constitutional law, the prosecutor's discretion to
prosecute in a federal rather than a state forum does not violate due process or equal protection
Several scholars have noted this judicial reluctance to apply a rational basis standard.  As
Professor Gifford has explained:
The rule articulated by most federal and state courts is that the prosecution violates the
defendant's equal protection rights, thereby entitling the defendant to a dismissal of
charges, only when "the government's discriminatory selection of him for prosectution
has been invidious or in bad faith, i.e., based upon such impermissable consideration as
race, religion, or the desire to prevent his exercise of constitutional rights."
Gifford, supra note 28 at 661-62 (footnote omitted) (quoting United States v. Berrios, 501 F.2d
1207, 1211, (2d Cir. 1974)). Berrios first stated this rule, which most courts have since followed
"with unthinking but general acceptance."  DAvis, supra note 28, at 164. See also Applegate,
supra note 28, at 47; Gifford, supran ote 28, at 680 ("In the case of constitutional challenge to the
prosecutor's charging decision, there does not appear to be even a minimum rationality require-
ment when no suspect classification or fundamental right is involved."). In other contexts, some
lower courts have explicitly denied the right to rational administrative classifications.  See, e.g., E
& T Realty v. Strickland, 830 F.2d 1107, 1114 (11th Cir. 1987), cert. denied, 485 U.S. 961 (1988)

apparently conclude that as long as a charging decision is not moti-
vated by considerations  that would trigger strict or heightened scru-
tiny, it need not be rational.  Other courts neither confirm nor deny
the existence of a right to rational charging classifications but refuse to
conduct  review  unless faced  with evidence  of improper  discrimina-
tion.208  It may matter little to a criminal defendant seeking judicial
relief whether a court does not recognize  an equal protection-based
restriction  on prosecutorial  discretion, or simply refuses  to conduct
the  review  necessary  to enforce  that restriction, but  the  difference
should matter to prosecutors.  If, contrary to some lower court deci-
sions, equal protection imposes a rationality requirement, prosecutors
are bound to comply with that constitutional command whether or not
courts are willing to enforce it.209  Thus, putting aside the question of
("Even arbitrary administration of a statute, without purposeful discrimination, does not violate
the equal protection clause.").  But see id at 1115-16 (Kravitch, J.c,o ncurring and dissenting)
(asserting that equal protection rational relationship requirement does apply to administrative
decisions).
Although some cases conclude that "bad faith" charging decisions violate equal protection,
it is not clear whether courts use that term to denote charging decisions based on malice or
animosity, see Gifford, supra note 28, at 677 ("[p]resumably,"  personal hatred is sufficient to
show bad faith), which would extend selective prosecution doctrine beyond classifications that
trigger strict or heightened scrutiny, or whether "bad faith" is simply shorthand for charging
decisions brought because of race or religion, see, e.g., United States v. Gordon, 817 F.2d 1538,
1539 (11th Cir. 1987), vacated in part on other grounds, 836 F.2d 1312 (11th Cir. 1988) (stating
that evidence "that the decision to prosecute was invidious or in bad faith because it was based
upon an impermissible factor such as race" is a prerequisite for selective prosecution claims)
(emphasis added), or in response to the exercise of a constitutional right. See Mark Lemle Am-
sterdam, The One-Sided Sword. Selective Prosecutioni n Federal Courts, 6 Rur.-CAm. L.J. 1, 22
(1974)  (interpreting "bad faith" to mean in response to the exercise of a constitutional  right).
See generally Cardinale & Feldman, supra note 28, at 671 (discussing ambiguity of term "bad
faith").
Some courts have held that a claim of malicious enforcement entitles a litigant to relief in a
civil action filed under 42 U.S.C. §1983. See, eg., Yerardi's Moody St. Restaurant & Lounge v.
Board of Selectmen, 932 F.2d 89, 92 (1st Cir. 1991) (recognizing maliciousness as a grounds for
relief); LeClair v. Saunders, 627 F.2d 606, 610-11 (2d Cir. 1980) (same).  But see Futernick v.
Sumpter Township, 78 F.3d 1051, 1057-58 (6th Cir.), cert. denied, 117 S.C t. 296 (1996) (rejecting
malicious enforcement as a grounds for relief). Even if courts were to prohibit malicious prose-
cutions on equal protection grounds, such a prohibition would still fall short of a requirement
that prosecutors have affirmatively rational reasons for charging decisions.
208.  See, eg., United States v. Oakes, 11 F.3d 897, 899 (9th Cir. 1993) ("[W]e have no juris-
diction to review prosecutors' charging decisions, absent proof of discrimination based on sus-
pect characteristics such as race, religion, gender or personal beliefs."); United States v. Palmer,
3 F.3d 300, 305 (9th Cir. 1993) ("[S]eparation of powers concerns prohibit us from reviewing a
prosecutor's charging decisions absent a prima facie showing that [the selection of the defendant
for federal rather than state prosecution] rested on an impermissible basis, such as gender, race
or denial of a constitutional right."  (footnote omitted)).
209.  As the Ninth Circuit noted in United States v. Redondo-Lemos:
The judicial branch is not the only one charged with enforcing the Constitution of the
United States.  The President and Congress, and all of the subordinate employees

judicial enforcement, it is useful to consider whether equal protection
imposes such an obligation.
Judicial refusal to recognize  a constitutionally imposed require-
ment that prosecutors make rational charging decisions is a departure
from standard equal protection doctrine.  Lower courts have reached
such  a conclusion  primarily by interpreting  the language  in several
Supreme Court opinions to require proof of deliberately impermissi-
ble discrimination, such as that which would trigger strict or height-
ened  scrutiny  in other  contexts,  before  finding  that  administrative
actors, like prosecutors, have violated equal protection.  For example,
in Snowden v. Hughes2,10 the Court stated that
[t]he unlawful administration by state officers of a state statute fair
on its face, resulting in its unequal application to those who are enti-
fled to be treated  alike, is not a denial of equal protection unless
there is shown to be present in it an element of intentional or pur-
poseful discrimination.211
Similarly, in Oyler v. Boles,212  the Court held that a prosecutor's
selective charging decisions are unconstitutional if "deliberately based
upon an unjustifiable standard such  as race, religion,  or other  arbi-
trary classification. 2 13  Some lower courts construe these passages as
within their respective branches, have a solemn responsibility to comply with the Con-
stitution in the performance of their assigned functions. This responsibility is derived
directly from the Constitution and is reinforced by the oath of office administered to
every government employee before he enters on duty. 5 U.S.C. §3331.  When no judi-
cial remedy is available to enforce constitutional strictures, we must rely on the dili-
gence and good faith of the officials  of the other branches to avoid constitutional
violations.

of constitutional magnitude when members of a state election Primary Canvassing Board failed
to designate him as one of two Republican nominees for the Illinois General Assembly, despite
the fact that he had received sufficient primary election votes to be nominated, state law re-
quired that he be designated as a nominee, and the Board had properly designated the other
Republican nominee.

against irrational  charging  decisions that harm individuals.215  How-

it more likely that he would be charged.  The Court rejected the claim,
holding that in order to prevail on a selective prosecution claim a de-
fendant must prove that the prosecutor selected him because  of his
exercise of his First Amendment rights.219  From this, lower courts ap-
parently  reason that  Wayte imposes  a  "proof-of-improper-purpose"
threshold  for all selective  prosecution claims.320  A defendant  who
only questions the rationality of a charging decision can never satisfy
this requirement because  a rationality challenge  tacitly concedes an
inability to prove that the prosecutor has an improper discriminatory
purpose.  However,  Wayte  does  not  impose  such  a  threshold.
Although Wayte does require proof of an improper prosecutorial pur-
pose, it does  so only in those cases in which the  defendant's equal
protection claim is predicated on an allegation that an exercise of a
constitutional right (or membership in a suspect class) played a role in
the charging decision."2  Wayte never challenged the decision to pros-
ecute him but not others who had also failed to register as simply irra-
tional.  Thus, the Court had no occasion  to address  the viability of
such a claim.
Whatever force lower courts' interpretations of Snowden, Oyler,
and Wayte may have once had,22 it is unlikely that they survived Wade
219.  See supra note 205.
220.  For example, in Esmail, 53 F.3d at 178-79, the court cited Wayte for the proposition that
[tjhe [only] form of selective prosecution...  that is actionable under the federal Con-
stitution ...  is where the decision to prosecute is made either in retaliation for the
exercise of a constitutional right, such as the right to free speech or to the free exercise
of religion, or because of membership in a vulnerable group.
See also Developments, supra note 205, at 1540-41 (reading Wayte as imposing purposefulness
threshold for all selective prosecution claims).
221.  Cf. United States  v. Redondo-Lemos,  955 F.2d 1296, 1303-04  n.1  (9th  Cir. 1991)
(Canby, J., concurring) ("The [Wayte] Court did not say... that in a case of pure arbitrariness,
such as a coin toss decision, due process inquiry would be precluded.").
222.  At the root of lower courts' interpretations of Snowden, Oyler, and Wayte as limiting
selective prosecution doctrine to cases involving deliberately improper discrimination may be
the fear that a more generous view would compel prosecutors and administrators to treat all
similarly situated persons the same absent a rational reason to do otherwise, regardless of the
prosecutor's or administrator's state of mind.  Such a "strict liability" equal protection require-
ment would enable any person to assert a right to the more lenient treatment that any similarly
situated person already had received or receives in the future, whether or not the government
actor intended to treat.the complaining person more harshly or even knew that the other person
had received more favorable treatment. The Eleventh Circuit raised the specter of such a result
in E & T Realty v. Strickland, 830 F.2d 1107 (11th Cir. 1987):
The problem with the district court's standard [that an arbitrary but not improperly
discriminatory administrative classification violated equal protection] is that any depar-
ture from state law would give rise to a constitutional claim. Under the district court's
standard, if local government decisionmakers correctly applied a facially neutral resolu-
tion in hundreds of cases and erroneously applied it in a single case, they could never

v. United States,'  a more recent Supreme Court decision.  In Wade, a
unanimous  Court concluded  that the Constitution  requires  that all
prosecutorial decisions, including charging decisions, be rationally re-
lated to legitimate government ends.  The Court did not suggest equal
protection prohibits only improper discriminatory decisions.  At issue
in Wade was whether there are limitations on federal prosecutors'  dis-
cretion to refuse  to  fie  sentencing motions  acknowledging  defend-
ants'  "substantial  assistance"  in the  investigation  or  prosecution  of
another person. Without such motions, courts are powerless to depart
downward  from statutory mandatory  minimum  sentences  and  sen-
tencing guidelines ranges to credit a defendant's cooperation?-24
again apply it correctly without violating equal protection. A plaintiff [alleging a con-
stitutional violation under 42 U.S.C. § 1983], to whom the statute was subsequently
correctly applied, could establish a denial of equal protection merely by proving that
the statute was misapplied in a single previous incident and that there is no rational
reason for the difference between the single previous misapplication and the subse-
quent correct application to him.
Id. at 1114. The Eleventh Circuit's position-doubting the existence of a constitutional obliga-
tion at all, rather than simply questioning the propriety of judicial review-is unpersuasive.  As
is explained in detail below, see infra notes 287-88 and accompanying text, there is a middle
ground between a rigid requirement of equal treatment without regard to a prosecutor's mental
state on one hand and a threshold requiring proof of deliberate improper discrimination suffi-
cient to trigger strict or heightened scrutiny on the other. Simply put, without running afoul of
the Supreme Court's selective prosecution doctrine, courts can require proof that the prosecutor
knows of a pool of similarly situated persons being treated more leniently before imposing equal
protection constraints.
223.  504 U.S. 181 (1992).  After law enforcement officials arrested Wade in possession of
cocaine, handguns, and $22,000 in cash, he agreed to cooperate with them, giving "valuable
assistance" that resulted in the convictions of other drug dealers. See id. at 183; Wade v. United
States, 936 F.2d 169, 170-71 (4th Cir. 1991).  Despite Wade's cooperation, the government did
not make a "departure motion" at Wade's sentencing. As a result, the court could not reduce his
sentence to reward his cooperation.  Understandably  disillusioned, Wade moved the district
court for a downward departure from the sentencing guidelines and sought permission to inquire
into the government's reasons for refusing to make a departure motion to determine if that
refusal was arbitrary or in bad faith. The district court denied both requests.  See id. at 171.
After the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed the district court decision, Wade
successfully petitioned the Supreme Court for certiorari.  See id. at 172-73.
224.  18 U.S.C. § 3553(e) (1996)  empowers federal prosecutors to move a court to depart
from a statutorily imposed mandatory minimum sentence to reward a defendant's "substantial
assistance in the investigation and prosecution of another person."  Section 5K1.1 of the United
States Sentencing Guidelines allows federal prosecutors to make a similar motion for a departure
from the sentencing guidelines.  In order for a court to depart from both a statutory minimum
and the guidelines, a prosecutor must make both motions. See United States v. Melendez, 116 S.
CL 2057 (1996).  Without such motions,  federal courts  are powerless  to depart from the
mandatory minimums and guidelines to reward a defendant for cooperating with the govern-
ment. See, eg., United States v. Emery, 34 F.3d 911, 912-13 (9th Cir. 1994).
HeinOnline -- 70 S. Cal. L. Rev. 689 1996-1997SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA LAW REVIEW  [Vol. 70:643
The Wade Court found that constitutional requirements constrain
the government's discretion to refuse to file departure motions.-5  For
example, the Court noted that Wade "would be entitled to relief if a
prosecutor refused to file a substantial-assistance motion, say, because
of a  defendant's  race or religion.''16  More importantly,  the Court
also made clear that the decision not to move for a departure must be
rational, a point that the  government  conceded.  The  Court wrote:
"Wade would be entitled to relief if the prosecutor's refusal to move
was not rationally related to any legitimate Government end ....,,2 27
Significantly, the Court accepted without question  that the same re-
striction  applies  to  charging  decisions:  "[W]e  see  no  reason  why
courts should treat a prosecutor's refusal to  fie a substantial-assist-
ance motion differently from a prosecutor's  other decisions, see, e.g.,
Wayte v.  United States...."28   By citing  Wayte, which involved an
equal protection  challenge to a charging  decision, the Court clearly
indicated that charging decisions, indeed virtually all prosecutorial de-
cisions, must be rational.29
Whether or not there are valid reasons for courts to refrain from
enforcing  this "rational  prosecution " obligation-a  topic that Part
Four of this Article addresses-Wade makes sense.  Equal protection
225.  See Wade, 504 U.S. at 185. The Court's opinion does not state whether equal protection
or due process principles impose the constraints. Elsewhere, the Court has noted that when
assessing the constitutionality of allegedly arbitrary classifications, "an argument based on equal
protection essentially duplicates an argument based on due process."  See Chapman v. United
States, 500 U.S. 453, 465 (1991)  (citing Jones v. United States, 463 U.S. 354, 362 n.10 (1983)).
226.  Wade, 504 U.S. at 186.  The Court determined, however, that Wade "never alleged,
much less claimed to have evidence tending to show, that the Government refused  to file a
motion for suspect reasons such as his race or his religion."  See IhL
227.  Id.
228.  Id. at 185.
229.  Despite Wade, the Supreme Court later determined in Purkett v. Elam, 115 S.C t. 1769
(1995) (per curiam), that a prosecutor's  reason given to justify the exercise of a peremptory
challenge need not "make[ ] sense" in order to comport with equal protection, exempting such
decisions from any rationality requirement.  See id. at 1771.  Purkett's apparent rejection of a
rationality requirement is likely limited to peremptory challenges, which litigants historically
could exercise without any reason at all. See Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U.S. 79, 123 (1986) (Bur-
ger, C.J., dissenting) (stating that "unadulterated equal protection analysis is simply inapplicable
to peremptory challenges. ...A  clause that requires a minimum 'rationality'  in government
actions has no application to 'an arbitrary and capricious right."')  (citations omitted). See gener-
ally Swain v. Alabama, 380 U.S. 202, 211-21 (1965).  In addition to the historical pedigree of
peremptory challenges, the Purkett Court may have been influenced by the fact that prospective
jurors' interests in being free from arbitrary peremptory challenges are far less significant than
other interests that equal protection doctrine addresses. Because other prosecutorial decisions,
including charging decisions and departure motions, affect more substantial interests and are not
characterized by a history of accepted irrational use, Purkett is not a retreat from Wade.
HeinOnline -- 70 S. Cal. L. Rev. 690 1996-19971997] FEDERALIZATION OF CRIMINAL LAW
compels government actors to behave rationally when classifying peo-
ple in other contexts.230  These contexts often involve commercial  or
economic interests  that are far less compelling  than those at stake
when prosecutors determine who to select for prosecution. 1  In light
of the  profound effect that charging  decisions  have on the lives  of
those chosen, including possible pretrial detention, the rigors of crimi-
nal prosecution, and the potential deprivation of life or liberty that a
conviction entails, it would be anomalous for the Constitution to ex-
empt charging decisions from a standard that applies to governmental
classifications affecting  less significant interests.
Indeed, it may be appropriate for courts to hold charging deci-
sions to a more demanding standard than that applied to less conse-
quential classifications.  The Court purports to reject such a position,
maintaining that unless a classification impairs a fundamental right or
burdens a protected class, equal protection scrutiny does not vary with
the importance of the interests at stake.232  Several justices have ques-
tioned whether a rigid three-tiered approach, with an extremely defer-
ential standard applied to all classifications that do not merit strict or
heightened scrutiny, is  consistent with the  Court's treatment of the
cases or desirable. Justice Marshall argued that the Court's equal pro-
tection decisions can and should be explained as the application of "a
spectrum  of standards"  involving  "variations  in the degree of care
with which the Court will scrutinize particular classifications depend-
ing..,  on the constitutional and societal importance of the interest
adversely affected and the recognized invidiousness of the basis upon
which the particular classification is drawn. 283  Similarly, Justice Ste-
vens contends that all equal protection decisions apply a single, flexi-
ble  standard  of  rationality  that  "includes  a  requirement  that  an

impartial  lawmaker  could  logically  believe  that  the  classification
would serve a legitimate public purpose that transcends  the harm to
the members  of the  disadvantaged  class.''234 Unlike  traditional  ra-
tional relationship analysis, this approach would require balancing the
purpose of the classification against the burdens that it imposes.  Both
the Marshall "spectrum" view and the Stevens unified-rationality ap-
proach would likely require greater scrutiny of prosecutors'  charging
decisions than the traditional standard 35  Even if these formulations
of  the Court's  equal protection jurisprudence  are inaccurate,  or if
charging  decisions  need  not meet  a  requirement  more  demanding
than that which governs less significant classifications, such  decisions
certainly  must  satisfy  the  same  minimal  standard  that  applies
elsewhere.
The equal protection rationality requirement  does not prohibit
intentionally  selective  charging  decisions.  Indeed,  the  Court  has
stated that "conscious exercise  of some selectivity in enforcement is
not in itself a federal constitutional violation.'' 36  Rather, as in other

contexts,  the  rationality  standard  simply demands  that  prosecutors
have valid reasons for charging decisions that treat one offender dif-
ferently than others who appear to be similarly situated.37  The rea-

237.  There is reason to believe that equal protection rationality review is more stringent
when applied to administrators' decisions than legislative classifications.  In Allegheny Pittsburg
Coal Co. v. County Comm'r of Webster County, 488 U.S. 336,344 (1989), the Court struck down
a local assessment practice that created significant disparities between mining property that had
been recently sold and that which had not, but noted that "[w]e  need not...  decide today
whether the Webster County assessment method would stand on a different footing if it were the
law of a State, generally applied, instead of the aberrational enforcement policy it appears to
be."  Three years later, in Nordlinger v. Hahn, 112 S.C t. 2326 (1992), the Court upheld a provi-
sion of the California Constitution that created similar disparities between sold and unsold prop-
erty, but which, unlike the Webster County disparities, resulted from a provision resulting from a
statewide ballot initiative rather than an administrator's enforcement policy.

been prosecuted:  It must distinguish between those who  are prose-
cuted and those who are not."3  In addition, there must be a rational
connection between  the reason for the differential  treatment and  a
legitimate government objective.239
C.  PROSECUTION UNDER DUPLICATIVE FEDERAL STATUTES
Although  there  is  no reason  why the  rationality  requirement
should not apply to all prosecutorial charging decisions, it has greater
import for federal prosecutors'  decisions to select only some eligible
offenders for prosecution under duplicative federal statutes.  To ex-
plain why this is so it is necessary to compare prosecutors' decisions to
bring charges  generally  with federal prosecutors'  decisions  to bring
charges under duplicative federal statutes.  Assume there is a pool of
offenders,  all of whom have  committed  a particular  crime.  If the
crime is a serious one, typically both state prosecutors and those fed-
eral prosecutors  enforcing nonduplicative  federal statutes will  bring
charges  against  all  known  and  convictable  members  of that pool.
Prosecutors have a powerful incentive to do so because a decision not
to prosecute  would  enable  the offenders  to  escape  punishment.4°
Such an outcome not only runs contrary to a prosecutor's obligations
238.  See, eg., Rinaldi v. Yeager, 384 U.S. 305, 308-09 (1966)  (stating that equal protection
"imposes a requirement of some rationality in the nature of the class singled out... requir[ing]
that, in defining a class subject to legislation, the distinctions that are drawn have 'some rele-
vance to the purpose for which the classification is made')  (citations omitted).
239.  See United States R.R. Retirement Bd. v. Fritz, 449 U.S. 166, 184 (1980) (Brennan, J.,
dissenting) ("When faced with a challenge to a... classification under the rational-basis test, the
court should ask first, what the purposes of the [classification]  are, and, second, whether the
classification is rationally related to achievement of those purposes."); Zobel v. Williams, 457
U.S. 55, 62-63 (1982)  (determining that state objective of rewarding citizens for past contribu-
tions to state "is not a legitimate state purpose").
240.  Arguably, in cases of overlapping jurisdiction, a state prosecutor could decide not to
bring charges in a serious case without fear that the offender will go unpunished because federal
prosecution would be available.  In reality, however, state prosecutors cannot rely on federal
prosecutors to serve as a "safety net" by prosecuting convictable offenders whose conduct vio-
lates both state and federal law. Federal prosecutors almost certainly lack the resources to pur-
sue more than a handful of offenders who state prosecutors deem unworthy of prosecution.  See
supra note 177.
Similarly, the possibility of state prosecution does not serve as an effective safety net if
federal prosecutors fail to bring charges against known and convictable violators of nonduplica-
tive federal statutes. First, there may be no analogous state law. Even if there is a state law that
prohibits the violator's conduct, it may not adequately protect the interests that the federal law is
meant to safeguard.  As a result, federal prosecutors may be loath to rely on state prosecution to
vindicate distinct federal interests, particularly in serious cases.

as a law enforcement official, but also may prove harmful to a state
prosecutor's chances of future electoral success.24'
Thus, for serious  offenses,  two factors  usually  will  distinguish
prosecuted from unprosecuted offenders: whether they are known and
whether they are convictable.  Obviously, prosecutors cannot and do
not bring charges  against offenders who have not been identified as
having  committed  an  offense.  Even  when  prosecutors  know  that
someone has committed an offense, they usually will not bring charges
if they lack sufficient admissible evidence to prove the case. Although
they may screen offenders who commit minor offenses like possession
of small amounts of drugs for personal use, gambling, and prostitution
by use of other criteria as well,' 2  the costs of choosing not to prose-
cute any known and provable serious offenses outweigh any advan-
tages gained by selectivity.' 3
In contrast, federal prosecutors  selecting offenders  who violate
duplicative federal statutes have far greater freedom.  As is true for
241.  Although there is disagreement about the extent to which state and local prosecutors
are politically accountable, repeated failure to prosecute cases against known serious offenders
would almost certainly harm reelection efforts.  Compare Beale, supra note 2, at 994 ("State
criminal laws are enforced by elected state and local prosecutors who are ... politically account-
able to their varied constituencies."), with Gifford, supra note 28, at 670 ("In theory, [state and
local prosecutors] can be defeated for re-election if the public disapproves  of abuses in the
charging decision.  In reality, however, the prosecutor's decisions are not highly publicized, and
voters' memories are short.  The election of the prosecutor is not a referendum on charging
policies."), and Bubany & Skillem, supra note 28, at 488,492 n.105 (noting that political controls
on prosecutors are "conjectural" and "illusory"; "[r]arely  is the public aware of any activity of
the prosecutor other than in connection with sensational trials reported by the news media. Ad-
ditionally, prosecutors' policies are seldom publicized, elections are infrequent, and the voter's
memory is short."  (footnote omitted)).  Because almost  all local  and state prosecutors  are
elected, see DEFRANcEs Er AT., supra note 177, at 1 (95%  of chief prosecutors elected locally),
they likely perceive political pressure to bring charges in most or all provable serious cases,
whether such pressure actually exists.  No similar pressures affect federal prosecutors, who are
appointed by the President and are not accountable to a local constituency.  See Frase, supra
note 170, at 249.
242.  See Givelber, supra note 28, at 97,106 ("Only those laws whose violation does not have
an immediate, personal effect on unconsenting others are likely candidates for unequal or spo-
radic enforcement.  Gambling laws, licensing laws, post-no-bills laws, Sunday closing laws are
typical examples.") (footnotes omitted); Vorenberg, supra note 28, at 1531 ("Prosecutors exer-
cise the greatest charging discretion when dealing with minor offenses,  such as consensual
crimes, petty thefts, and assaults without serious injury.").
243.  See Abrams, supra note 28, at 11-12 (stating that "[p]rosecutors probably do not exer-
cise much discretion to withhold prosecution where violent crimes ...  have been committed");

obviously less frequent in cases of violent felonies"; they are largely based on "whether there is
sufficient evidence to convict"); Vorenberg, supra note 28, at 1526 ("Prosecutors exercise the
least discretion over those crimes that most frighten, outrage, or intrigue the public, such as
murder, rape, arson, armed robbery, kidnapping, and large-scale trafficking in hard drugs.").
HeinOnline -- 70 S. Cal. L. Rev. 694 1996-19971997]
FEDERALIZATION OF CRIMINAL LAW
charging  decisions  generally, federal prosecutors may not prosecute
because they do not know of the offense or offender, or because they
lack sufficient admissible evidence to convict.  However, federal pros-
ecutors have considerably greater latitude to screen offenders-even
those who have committed  serious crimes-using additional criteria
because, where duplicative statutes are involved, their failure to pros-
ecute does not mean that the offenders go unpunished.  Because an
offender's  conduct  will also violate state law,  he is  subject to state
prosecution  even  if  the  federal  prosecutor  chooses  not  to  bring
charges.  State prosecutors will likely have the resources to prosecute
cases that federal prosecutors do not pursue, and, as the primary pros-
ecution entity in their jurisdiction, have an obligation to do so.  Thus,
federal prosecutors  are free to ignore  or decline to prosecute cases
against known and convictable offenders.244
Significantly, because federal prosecutors lack the resources nec-
essary to review the evidence in all cases eligible for duplicative fed-
eral prosecution,245  they must resort to methods  of screening  cases
other than consideration  of the "convictability"  of individual offend-
ers.  Federal prosecutors  can employ a variety of methods to accom-
plish this  preliminary  sorting.  For  example,  they may review  only
those cases that are investigated by federal law enforcement agencies
or those  that involve threshold quantities  of drugs or money, espe-
cially dangerous or violent offenders, or particular federal offenses.  In
short,  they  can  employ  policy-based  screening  mechanisms  before
having to conduct case-specific assessments  of evidence.246  Alterna-
tively (and problematically), federal prosecutors may not employ pre-
determined screening criteria at all, distinguishing instead between the
cases that they review and those that they overlook with no principled
basis for doing so.
244.  See Frase, supran ote 170, at 250 ("[F]ederal criminal laws frequently overlap with state
statutes, permitting the federal prosecutor additional flexibility in the selection of cases.").
245.  See supra note 177.
246.  Professors Bubany and Skillem noted a similar dichotomy when they discussed "two
basic standards" that prosecutors use when determining when to bring charges: "(1)  the con-
victability of the accused and (2) the desirability of obtaining a conviction vis-a-vis pursuing
some other course. In other words, the prosecutor determines not only whether he can convict,
but also whether he should convict."  Bubany & Skillem, supra note 28, at 479 (footnote omit-
ted).  Although state prosecutors and federal prosecutors enforcing nonduplicative federal stat-
utes will  almost  always answer  the second  question affirmatively  when serious crimes are
involved, they have more flexibility when considering whether to prosecute minor offenses.
When the costs of allowing unprosecuted offenders to go unpunished are low, prosecutors have
more freedom to screen cases by use of methods other than consideration of the strength of
evidence. See supra notes 242-43 and accompanying text.
HeinOnline -- 70 S. Cal. L. Rev. 695 1996-1997696  SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA LAW REVIEW  [Vol. 70:643
These differences help explain why the equal protection rational-
ity requirement is particularly important as a limit on federal prosecu-
tors'  decisions  about  whether  to  bring  charges  under  duplicative
federal statutes.  First, their greater freedom to ignore offenders-a
freedom afforded by the "safety net" of potential state prosecution-
carries  with it an  enhanced risk that selection will be arbitrary,  in-
creasing the importance of an equal protection rationality constraint.
More  discretion does  not necessarily lead to unprincipled  decision-
making, but it certainly magnifies the danger. 7
Second, equal protection is more likely to be applicable to a fed-
eral prosecutor's decision to select only some offenders.  Equal pro-
tection does not constrain a prosecutor's charging discretion unless, at
a minimum, the  prosecutor knows  of uncharged  offenders  who are
similarly situated to those who the prosecutor has charged.2 48  Thus,
equal protection doctrine has nothing to say about a prosecutor's fail-
ure to charge  unknown  similarly situated  others.  However,  it may
have something to say when a federal prosecutor chooses to prosecute
some offenders and ignore others who instead are prosecuted in state
court.  Federal prosecutors are aware that their state counterparts are
bringing charges  for crimes  also covered  by federal statutes.  They
know  that the  offenders  exist,  have  been identified,  apprehended,
charged,  and  are eligible  for  prosecution under  duplicative  federal
statutes.  Although federal prosecutors  may not be familiar with the
specific  evidence  against  each  such  offender,  this  ignorance  is  the
product  of their own preliminary screening decisions  by which they
select cases for review.  Thus, federal prosecutors arguably have suffi-
cient "knowledge" of such offenders to trigger an equal protection ob-
ligation  to have a  rational  basis for treating  them differently  than
similar federally prosecuted offenders.249  In short, a federal prosecu-
tor's awareness that similarly situated offenders are charged in state
court may create otherwise nonexistent equal protection obligations.
247.  The same holds true for other charging decisions that do not present prosecutors with
the choice of bringing charges or allowing the offender to go unpunished. For example, prosecu-
tors have considerable latitude when determining whether to seek the death penalty or other
sentencing enhancements based on the criminal history of the offender or the nature of the
offense. A decision not to seek death or an enhanced sentence does not allow the offender to
avoid punishment.
248.  See Oyler v. Boles, 368 U.S. 448, 456 (1962).  See also infra notes 287-89 and accompa-
nying text.  Viewed from another perspective, the prosecutor's lack of knowledge of uncharged
offenders is a rational basis for differential treatment.
249.  For a more detailed discussion of whether federal prosecutors "know" of the offenders
prosecuted in state court, see infra notes 287-89 and accompanying text.
HeinOnline -- 70 S. Cal. L. Rev. 696 1996-19971997] FEDERALIZATION OF CRIMINAL LAW
Finally, federal prosecutors' selection criteria, or lack thereof, are
more susceptible to the limits that the rational relationship constraint
imposes.  The  principal criterion  that state prosecutors  and federal
prosecutors enforcing nonduplicative federal statutes use in deciding
whether to prosecute known offenders who commit serious crimes is
the likelihood of conviction 510  This method of distinction between
charged and uncharged offenders is eminently rational.  In contrast,
when federal prosecutors enforcing duplicative federal statutes make
preliminary selection decisions by screening cases without considera-
tion of the evidence, as they are able to and indeed must do, there is
no similar guarantee that the screening criteria will be rational.  As a
result, there is a greater chance that a rationality requirement can in-
form their charging decisions151
Ill.  DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE POLICY AND  PRACTICE
The profound effect that federal charging decisions can have on
the treatment of offenders, federal prosecutors'  considerable  discre-
tion when enforcing duplicative statutes, and the absence of meaning-
ful judicial oversight make effective administrative  guidance critical.
Unfortunately, Department of Justice policy falls short of dictating an
affirmative obligation to make rational selection decisions.  Further-
more, in an effort to provide guidance to federal prosecutors making
charging  decisions, the Department encourages an approach that in-
fringes on state law enforcement policy and may be unfair to offend-
ers.  Existing  practice  reflects  these  policy  deficiencies.  Federal
prosecutors sometimes select offenders for prosecution without deter-
mining whether  there  is  a  principled  basis  for distinguishing  them
from similar offenders  who receive more lenient treatment because
they are charged in state, not federal, court. The Department should
amend its policy to require federal prosecutors to have a rational basis
for making these decisions.
A.  Tim "PRINCIPLES  OF FEDERAL PROSECUnON"
The "Principles  of Federal Prosecution" provide Department of
Justice standards for the charging decisions  of federal prosecutors in
250.  See supra notes 240-42 and accompanying text.
251.  Cf. Abrams, supra note 28, at 11 (noting the difference between strength-of-evidence
considerations, which "do not lend themselves to much meaningful systemization," and "consid-
erations...  linked to particular offense categories," which do).
HeinOnline -- 70 S. Cal. L. Rev. 697 1996-1997SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA LAW REVIEW  [Vol. 70:643
the United States Attorney's offices."2  To a degree, these guidelines
promote rational charging decisions by precluding federal prosecutors
from considering an offender's "race, religion, sex, national origin, or
political  association,  activities  or beliefs;  [t]he  [federal  prosecutor's]
own personal feelings concerning the [offender], the [offender's] asso-
ciates,  or the victim;  or [t]he  possible effect  of the decision  on the
[prosecutor's]  own professional  or personal circumstances.''z53  How-
ever,  other than  explicitly prohibiting  charging  decisions  based  on
these improper considerations,  the guidelines do not ensure that fed-
eral prosecutors will have affirmatively rational reasons for selecting
which among all eligible convictable offenders will be subject to fed-
eral prosecution.24
The  guidelines  permit  commencement  of  federal  prosecution
only if the government attorney believes that the offender's conduct
constitutes a federal offense provable by admissible evidence2 55 They
urge declination of prosecution despite such a belief, however, if "[n]o
substantial  federal  interest  would  be served  by  prosecution"  or if
"[t]he person is subject to effective  prosecution in another jurisdic-
tion."'256  These provisions appear to require that federal prosecutors
have a rational basis for differentiating between defendants selected
for federal prosecution-cases  in which there is a substantial federal
interest-and defendants that are left to the states for prosecution-
those subject to effective prosecution in another jurisdiction.  This ap-
pearance is deceptive.
The guidelines  require that prosecutors conduct the "substantial
federal interest" and "effective prosecution in another jurisdiction" in-
quiries only after assessing the evidence and determining that there is
252.  See U.S. DEP'T OF JUSTIcE, UNITED STATES ArToRNEYs' MANUAL § 9-27.000 (1993)

254.  See Mengler, supra note 3, at 533 (noting that the Department of Justice has not issued
specific guidelines about when cases that the states can prosecute should be brought in federal
court).

and that the admissible evidence will probably be sufficient to obtain and sustain a convic-
tion .... DOJ MANUAL, supra note 252, § 9-27.220(A).  Elsewhere, the manual explains that
the federal prosecutor can bring charges only if she "believes that the person probably will be
found guilty by an unbiased trier of fact."  Id. § 9-27.220(B).
256.  Id. § 9-27.220(A)(1)-(2).  Section 9-27.230(A) lists factors that a prosecutor should con-
sider when determining whether there is a "substantial federal interest."  Section 9-27.240(A)
lists factors to be considered when determining whether an offender is subject to "effective pros-
ecution in another jurisdiction."
HeinOnline -- 70 S. Cal. L. Rev. 698 1996-19971997] FEDERALIZATION OF CRIMINAL LAW
a provable offense."7  The guidelines  do not address the preliminary
screening decisions by which federal prosecutors distinguish between
the cases that they review and those that they ignore.  Thus, although
the guidelines may encourage rational distinctions between cases that
federal prosecutors actually assess and decline and those that they as-
sess and prosecute, they do not require that there be a rational basis
for  distinguishing  between  eligible  offenders  prosecuted  in federal
court and those who are instead prosecuted in state court because fed-
eral prosecutors never reviewed the evidence against them.25s  Other
257.  See id. § 9-27.220 (requiring assessment of grounds for declination only after assess-
ment of evidence).
The guidelines provide less than clear direction even in regard to applying the declination
criteria.  The manual states that a prosecutor "may properly decline to take action" when no
substantial federal interest will be served by federal prosecution or when effective prosecution is
available in another jurisdiction.  Id § 9-27.220(B)  (emphasis added). In addition, "[ilt is left to
the judgment of the attorney for the government whether such a situation exists."  Id  Further-
more, the guidelines are advisory, having little binding effect in individual cases.  Section 9-
27.140 allows United States Attorneys in each federal district to depart from the prosecutive
guidelines "as necessary in the interests of fair and effective law enforcement within the district."
Although "[a]ny  significant modification or departure contemplated as a matter of policy or
regular practice must be approved by the appropriate Assistant Attorney General and the Dep-
uty Attorney General," no such approval is required for departures in individual cases. Id. § 9-
27.140(A)
258.  In 1994, the Department of Justice intimated that it would soon amend the "Principles
of Federal Prosecution" to require federal prosecutors to "meet with local prosecutors to estab-
lish local rules for distinguishing which offices would handle which [drug] cases." Drug Charging
Jurisdiction,D  OJ ALERT, Mar. 21, 1994. Although such an amendment would promote rational
selection of offenders for federal prosecution from among all eligible drug offenders, to date
there has been no such amendment. See Mengler, supra note 3, at 533 (discussing DOJ failure to
establish drug guidelines).
On its face, a provision in a different portion of the United States Attorneys' Manuals uggests
that federal prosecutors have an obligation to meet with state and local prosecutors to determine
which cases to prosecute in federal court among all cases that are eligible for federal prosecu-
tion.  Section 9-2.142(I)(E) states:
In order to ensure the most efficient use of law enforcement resources, whenever a
matter involves overlappingf ederal and state jurisdiction,f ederal prosecutors should at
the earliest possible time coordinate with their state counterparts to determine  the
most appropriate single forum in which to proceed to satisfy the substantial federal and
state interests involved, and to resolve all criminal liability for the acts in question if
possible.
DOJ MANUAL, supra note 252, § 9-2.142(I)(E) (emphasis added).  Read literally, this provision
appears to impose on federal prosecutors a duty to consider the propriety of federal prosecution
for every eligible offender, a mandate that would dramatically alter present practice. However,
because the quoted provision does not appear in the "Principles of Federal Prosecution," but
rather in the "Petite Policy" portion of the manual, which applies when "contemplated federal
prosecution is based on substantially the same act(s) or transactions(s) involved in a prior state
or federal prosecution," id. § 9-2.142(11)(A), it almost certainly imposes the obligations to coor-
dinate with state and local prosecutors only in those cases in which there is a risk of prosecutions
by both federal and state authorities. Thus, the provision is designed to reduce the likelihood of
dual prosecutions, rather than to rationally allocate offenders between federal and state courts.
For a discussion of the "Petite Policy," see infra note 312.

sections  in the  United  States Attorneys'  Manual, which  provide  of-
fense-specific charging guidance, do not remedy this deficiency.259
B.  THE "CoMPaRTIvE ADVANTAGE"  APPROACH
Among other considerations, the "Principles of Federal Prosecu-
tion" encourage federal prosecutors  to select  cases based  on differ-
ences  between  federal  and  state  laws.  They  instruct  federal
prosecutors to take into account whether there are "legal or eviden-
tiary problems  that might attend  prosecution in the other jurisdic-
tion.'260  They also mandate consideration of the "probable sentence"
available  in the other jurisdiction.261  Taken  together, these factors
suggest that federal prosecutors  should select offenders  in order to
take advantage of procedural and sentencing disparities between fed-
eral and state law.  They encourage federal prosecutors to file federal
charges  because  critical evidence has been or will be suppressed in
state court, a defendant  has greater bail or discovery rights in state
court, or a longer sentence is required in federal court.262  Consistent
259.  For example, sections 9-101.200 and 9-101.400(B), which became effective in July 1992,
discuss when drug cases should be charged in federal court.  These sections mandate the suffi-
ciency of the evidence in individual cases as one factor to be considered and discuss the declina-
tion of federal prosecution  and referral of cases to state and local prosecutors as alternatives to
federal prosecution. Thus, the sections suggest that the guidelines apply to cases that the federal
prosecutor has already  reviewed, giving federal  prosecutors guidance  about when to bring
charges and when to decline prosecution in those cases. There is no indication that the sections
are meant to apply more broadly to promote rational policies for differentiating between cases
involving all drug offenders eligible for federal prosecution, whether or not the federal prosecu-
tor has assessed the evidence.  Similarly, although section 943.110 discourages federal prosecu-
tion of mall-fraud schemes that "consist[ ] of some isolated transactions between individuals
[and] involv[e] minor loss to the victims," it otherwise imposes no general obligation on federal
prosecutors to ensure that there is a rational basis to select only some of the eligible fraud cases
and leave others for state prosecution.  DOJ MANUAL, supra note 252, § 9-43.110.
Further complicating matters, it sometimes appears as if federal prosecutors are unaware of
these guidelines or that they ignore them. For example, although section 9-131.040 limits use of
the robbery provisions of the Hobbs Act, 18 U.S.C. § 1951, to "instances involving organized
crime, gang activity, or wide-ranging schemes," it is used in more mundane circumstances.  See,
eg., United States v. Quigley, 53 F.3d 909 (8th Cir. 1995) (Hobbs Act prosecution of case involv-
ing stabbing and armed robbery of eighty cents to be used to purchase beer).
Although individual United States Attorney's Offices often have their own internal guide-
lines, see KAhusAR  E- AL., supra note 130, at 903 n.c, because they are not available to the
public, it is impossible to determine if they address the issues raised here.

262.  See Holion, supra note 3, at 513 n.57 (noting that the United States Attorneys' Manual
"appears virtually to instruct federal prosecutors to go after particular defendants on the basis
that a harsher sentence can be obtained under federal law").

FEDERALIZATION OF CRIMINAL LAW
with  these  administrative  guidelines,  both  the Attorney  General263
and a former Deputy Attorney General"  have cited the benefits of
more advantageous federal law as a valid reason for selecting offend-
ers for federal prosecution.265  Although the policy of seeking a com-
parative advantage does promote comparison of federally prosecuted
offenders with those charged in state court, it does not always ensure
rational selection of offenders.  Even when it does promote rational
charging decisions, the comparative approach has other shortcomings.
The effort to obtain a comparative advantage does not always ra-
tionally distinguish between defendants selected for federal prosecu-
tion and those who are not.  When compared with state laws, some
federal laws, such as those that increase the possibility of pretrial de-
tention  or routinely require longer sentences in drug cases, are uni-
formly advantageous to federal prosecutors.  In those cases, a desire
to take advantage  of federal law does not  explain the selection  of
some eligible defendants rather than others who would also be subject
to  the proprosecution  federal doctrines.266   To  screen  rationally  in
such cases, federal prosecutors must have some independent basis for
selecting the offenders against whom they seek to obtain the compara-
tive advantage that federal law confers-for example, reliable infor-
mation that a defendant is an organized crime figure or a major drug
trafficker.267  Such  characteristics,  as  opposed to the advantages  of
federal law, serve to rationally distinguish the selected offenders from
263.  In testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, then Attorney-General-designate
Janet Reno explained that when she served as district attorney for Dade County, Florida, her
office referred a case against corrupt police officers to federal authorities in part to avoid more
liberal state discovery rules. See Hearings of the Senate Judiciary Committee on the Nomination
of Janet Reno to be Attorney General  (Mar. 9, 1993), available in LEXIS, News Library,
SCRIPTS File.
264.  In a recent article responding to critics' concerns about federalization, former Deputy
Attorney General Jamie Gorelick cited the "comparative advantage" of federal procedures such
as "preventive detention" and "stiffer penalties" as reasons for federal rather than state prosecu-
tion. See Gorelick & Litman, supra note 4, at 976-77.
265.  See Harry Litman & Mark D. Greenberg, Reporters' Draftf or the Working Group on

those not prosecuted. Without such distinguishing characteristics, a se-
lection decision made to take advantage of a uniformly advantageous
federal law does not explain the different treatment and thus does not
68
satisfy equal protection.1
268.  United States v. Batchelder,4 42 U.S. 114 (1979), does not suggest otherwise.  In Batchel-
der, the Court stated that "[t]he prosecutor may be influenced by the penalties available upon
conviction, but this fact, standing alone, does not give rise to a violation of the Equal Protection
or Due Process Clause."  Id.a t 125.  The federal prosecutor in Batchelder had the option of
bringing charges under one of two different federal firearms statutes, both of which prohibited
convicted  felons like  Batchelder from possessing firearms.  The prosecutor  chose to use  18
U.S.C. § 922(h), which allowed imposition of a sentence of up to five years imprisonment, rather
than 18 U.S.C. App. § 1202(a), which carried a maximum sentence of only two years imprison-
ment.  After conviction, the court imposed a five-year sentence.  See id.at  116.  On appeal,
Batchelder claimed that the government's ability to select which statute to charge could result in
unequal treatment of people who had committed the same crime and thus violated equal protec-
tion and due process. The Court rejected the claim, noting that in cases in which criminal con-
duct violates more than one criminal statute, prosecutors have broad discretion to select charges,
"so long as [they do] not discriminate against any class of defendants."  Id.a t 124.  Analogizing
such cases to Batchelder's, the Court held that "j]ust as a defendant has no constitutional right
to elect which of two applicable federal statutes shall be the basis of his indictment and prosecu-
tion neither is he entitled to choose the penalty scheme under which he will be sentenced."  Id.
at 125. Lower courts have relied on Batcheldert o deny the constitutional claims of defendants
subject to harsher penalties in federal court.  Se4 eg., United States v. Nance, 962 F.2d 860, 865
(9th Cir. 1992); United States v. Andersen, 940 F.2d 593, 596 (10th Cir. 1991).
However, Batchelderi s not inconsistent with the view that equal protection requires federal
prosecutors to have rational reasons for determining which offenders are subject to the possibil-
ity of longer sentences.  First, Batchelder did not involve allegations that the government had
treated similarly situated others differently.  Batchelder merely argued that the possibility of
disparate treatment violated equal protection and due process. Thus, there was no reason for
the Court to consider prosecutors' obligations to rationally distinguish between similarly situated
offenders.  Second, the Court determined only that the prosecutor may be "influenced" by the
possibility of a longer sentence.  The Court did not address a situation in which the desire to
impose harsher penalties is the only reason for the changing decision, without some independent
basis for distinguishing between offenders. Third, Batchelderi nvolved a selection of one federal
statute rather than another, not a selection between state and federal forums. Thus, concerns
about the effect charging decisions would have on state criminal justice systems, see infra notes
269-70 and accompanying text, were absent.  Finally, at the time the Court decided Batchelder,
federal judges had largely unfettered sentencing discretion. The judge who sentenced Batchel-
der was free to impose a sentence no longer than that which would have been available had the
government brought charges under § 1202(a).  As the Court acknowledged, judicial discretion
was available to ameliorate any improprieties in the charging decision:  "[A prosecutor's] deci-
sion to proceed under § 922(h) does not empower the Government to predetermine ultimate
criminal sanctions.  Rather, it merely enables the sentencing judge to impose a longer prison
sentence than § 1202(a) would permit...." Batchelder,4 42 U.S. at 125.  In contrast, under the
present federal sentencing regime, with its mandatory minimum sentences and rigid guidelines,
the prosecutor's decision to select a defendant for federal prosecution will likely preclude the
sentencing court from taking into consideration the shorter sentence that would have been im-
posed in state court and reducing the federal sentence accordingly.  See United States v. Reyes,
966 F.2d 508, 509-10 (9th Cir. 1992) (district courts lack authority to depart from sentencing
guidelines to conform sentence to that received by co-accused who is prosecuted in state court).
HeinOnline -- 70 S. Cal. L. Rev. 702 1996-19971997] FEDERALIZATION OF CRIMINAL LAW
In other circumstances, however, federal law may provide a com-
parative  advantage only in certain cases,  thus serving to distinguish
the selected offender from others who instead are prosecuted in state
court.  For example, in a particular case, state law may require sup-
pression of evidence that is admissible in federal court.  Resort to fed-
eral  law  for  its  comparative  advantage  in  such  cases  provides  a
rational basis for distinction and thus does not raise equal protection
concerns.  Nonetheless, these situations may be problematic for other
reasons which should matter to the Department of Justice.
First, when promoted as a method of selection, the comparative
advantage  approach  encourages federal prosecutors  to intentionally
circumvent legal protections that states afford offenders.  In essence,
these selection decisions defeat the policies underlying state laws, such
as states' determinations that people who commit crimes within their
borders are entitled to certain procedural protections and should be
subject to certain punishments.269  Conflicts between the policies  em-
bodied in the federal and state criminal justice systems are unavoida-
ble, given the expansion  of federal substantive criminal law and the
procedural  and  sentencing  differences  between  the  two  systems.
However, the Department of Justice should be wary of exacerbating
269.  In fact, some state attorneys general and judges have expressed displeasure with the
intrusion of federal criminal law. See; e.g., Brickey, supra note 29, at 1165-66 n.170 (summarizing
views of attorneys general and judges); Reports and Proposals:F ederalizationo f Crime Is Focus
of Federal Bar Association Panel Discussion, 58 Crim. L. Rep. (BNA) 1175-76 (Nov. 22, 1995)
(giving judges' views of federalization).
One might respond that a federal prosecution does nothing to prevent a state from treating
those who violate state law any way that the state deems fit. Double jeopardy doctrine does not
bar a state from bringing charges when there has been a federal prosecution.  See supra note 7.
Although some states have statutory prohibitions on state prosecutions following federal prose-
cutions, see, eg., CAL. PENAL CoDE § 687 (West 1995); N.Y. Cm.  PRoc-  LAW §§ 40.10-40.30
(McKinney 1995), such laws reflect state policy choices and are not imposed by the federal gov-
ernment. Thus, unless they have chosen to bar successive prosecutions in their own courts, states
are free to apply any procedural rules and impose any sentences they deem appropriate, in-
dependent of federal charging decisions, prosecutions, and sentences.
Although technically correct, this view ignores the real concern-the federal government's
intrusion into law enforcement and its prosecutorial decisions that override state policy choices.
Subsequent state prosecutions not only fail to rectify that intrusion; at worst, they effectively
increase the offenders' sentences, exacerbating the problem.  When federal prosecutors select an
offender in ordert o circumvent more prodefendant state law, rather than because of some other
federal interest, their conduct infringes on the states' historical role as the primary enforcer of
criminal law, an infringement that a subsequent state prosecution will not remedy. The problem
is not simply that the federal government is increasing its involvement in law enforcement,
although some critics see that as a concern, see supra note 4, it is that federal prosecutors' charg-
ing decisions in individual cases purposefully frustrate state policy determinations about a matter
that historically has been within state and local control.
HeinOnline -- 70 S. Cal. L. Rev. 703 1996-1997SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA LAW REVIEW  [Vol. 70:643
the  situation  by encouraging its trial-line  prosecutors,  who  are un-
likely to be sensitive to state-federal comity concerns, to exploit differ-
ences as a principal method of selecting offenders.
Selection of defendants in order to defeat state procedural  pro-
tections can also reduce the efficacy of state efforts to deter police and
prosecutorial misconduct.  State  and  local law  enforcement  officers
who are aware that evidence obtained in violation of state constitu-
tional law is nonetheless admissible in federal court will have less in-
centive to respect state constitutional rights.270  The same holds true
for state prosecutors, who may be more willing to violate state laws
protecting defendants knowing that if courts sanction them by dismis-
sal or another remedy that forecloses state prosecution, federal prose-
cution remains available.  In fact, if investigators believe that federal
prosecution  will be  advantageous,  they may  violate  state constitu-
tional guarantees intentionally in an attempt to make the state forum
unavailable and thus prompt federal prosecutors to bring charges.
Finally, and perhaps most disturbing, selecting offenders for fed-
eral prosecution  in order  to obtain a  legal  advantage  can  penalize
them for having valid claims under state law.  Often, multiple aspects
of federal law, frequently including sentencing, are more favorable to
the prosecution than state law.  If a federal prosecutor selects a  de-
fendant in  order to  obtain a  comparative  advantage  by avoiding  a
state constitutional or procedural protection, such as a prodefendant
discovery  or suppression  doctrine,  the  defendant  may  not only  be
stripped of that benefit, but he may also be subject to other aspects of
federal law that are harsher than those that he would have faced in
state court.271  There is a danger that when police or state prosecutors
270.  Cf. State v. Isom, 761 P.2d 524, 528-29 (Or. 1988) ("[Far from discouraging the [local]
police [from continuing to question a suspect after he requests a lawyer], the federal rule [al-
lowing statements taken in violation of Miranda to be used to impeach]  they were following
actually encourages  unconstitutional interrogation where the suspect has taken the police at
their word and declined to talk.... Police officers have a duty to uphold the constitution of this
state  and  may  not  intentionally  violate  a person's  constitutional  rights  without  serious
sanctions.").
271.  This scenario occurred in United States v. Deitz, 991 F.2d 443 (8th Cir. 1993).  Deitz was
charged with drug offenses in an Arkansas court. The case was dismissed when the state failed
to bring the case to trial within the time limits of the state speedy trial act.  As a result of his
successful assertion of state rights, Deitz was charged in federal court, where he received  a
longer sentence than he would have if convicted in state court.  On appeal, the Eighth Circuit
affirmed the trial court's refusal to depart downward from the applicable federal sentence.  See
id. at 447-48.  In dissent, Senior Judge Bright noted that "the defendant who asserts rights
granted under state law now faces increased penalties in a federal court."  Id. at 449 (Bright, J.,
dissenting).  See also United States v. Reilly, 76 F.3d 1271 (2d Cir. 1996); People v. Reilly, 606
HeinOnline -- 70 S. Cal. L. Rev. 704 1996-19971997] FEDERALIZATION OF CRIMINAL LAW
violate state law, federal prosecutors will intervene to salvage prose-
cutions,  and defendants will suffer harsher treatment because  their
state constitutional or statutory rights have been violated.  The de-
fendant will not go free when the constable blunders; instead, he will
receive a longer sentence in federal court.
C.  CHARGING  PRACTIICES
Because prevailing doctrine ensures that federal prosecutors will
almost never have to explain decisions to ignore, reject, or select of-
fenders,272 and because practices vary from district to district, it is dif-
ficult to determine how federal prosecutors choose which offenders to
prosecute under duplicative  federal statutes and whether they do so
for reasons related  to legitimate government  objectives.273  At best,
one would hope that federal prosecutors make charging decisions, in-
cluding decisions  that determine which cases they will consider  for
prosecution, based on predetermined guidelines or standards designed
to further the goals of effective law enforcement.  Some United States
Attorneys'  Offices do employ such guidelines.274
N.Y.S. 2d 836 (1994).  Reilly received a six-month sentence in state court for growing marijuana.
He appealed, alleging that the search that uncovered the marijuana violated state constitutional
guarantees broader than those available in federal court.  The appellate court agreed,  sup-
pressing the marijuana needed to convict him, reversing the conviction, and dismissing the in-
dictment. See id. at 840. As a result, Reilly was prosecuted in federal court and exposed to the
possibility of a mandatory minimum sentence of five years imprisonment. See United States v.
Reilly, 875 F. Supp. 108 (N.D.N.Y. 1994), affd, 76 F.3d 1271 (2d Cir. 1996).  Fortunately for
Reilly, the federal district judge suppressed the marijuana on other grounds, see Reilly, 875 F.
Supp. at 121, and the Second Circuit affirmed.
272.  Prosecutors need not produce discovery related to a selective prosecution claim unless
a defendant presents some evidence of discriminatory effect and intent. See United States v.
Armstrong, 116 S. Ct. 1480,1488 (1996).  Although Armstrong only addressed the discriminatory
effect requirement in the context of the threshold burden to obtain discovery, it mentioned with
approval that Courts of Appeals require a defendant seeking discovery to present evidence of
"discriminatory effect and discriminatory intent."  Id.
273.  In 1980, Professor Frase studied the charging practices of the United States Attorney's
Office for the Northern District of Illinois.  See Frase, supra note 170.  Although instructive,
Frase's study has limited application to the present inquiry. First, Frase only considered those
matters actually referred to the office for prosecution.  He did not examine cases that had been
prescreened by some selection method that limited the number of cases that the office had to
consider.  See id. at 255.  Second, Frase's study is now 16 years old and precedes the present
federalization concerns.  Third, it only reflects the charging practices of a single United States
Attorney's Office.
274.  For example, some districts use quantitative guidelines to determine whether federal
prosecution is warranted, imposing a threshold weight figure in drug cases or a dollar figure in
fraud or money-laundering cases. These districts prosecute only those cases involving amounts
above the threshold. See, eg., CocAINE AND FEDERAL SENTENCING PoLcy, supra note 160, at
HeinOnline -- 70 S. Cal. L. Rev. 705 1996-1997SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA LAW REVIEW  [Vol. 70:643
On the other hand, one might fear that even if they obey constitu-
tional and administrative prohibitions barring the conscious selection
of offenders for obviously improper reasons such as race, some federal
prosecutors nonetheless select offenders haphazardly, without ration-
ally distinguishing them from similarly situated  others  who receive
radically different treatment in state court.275  Although these federal
prosecutors may not intentionally select defendants for bad reasons,
they do not do so for principled reasons either. Some observers have
concluded that such a fear is valid,276 and anecdotal evidence supports
their conclusions.
For example, some federal prosecutors  apparently bring charges
in drug cases against offenders who are no different than those rou-
tinely charged in state courts.  In 1990, the Federal Courts Study Com-
mittee noted that "[t]he  federal system [is being] overwhelmed with
[drug]  cases that could be prosecuted in state courts," and that "at the
present time minor [drug]  cases that lack..,  a connection [to inter-
state or foreign  commerce]  are being brought in many districts. '277
Similarly,  numerous  reported  appellate  decisions  describe  federal
139 (discussing 50 gram threshold for crack cocaine prosecutions in the Central District of Cali-
fornia); Bowman, supra note 92, at 739 n.219 (describing five kilogram powder guidelines in
United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Florida in the early 1990s). Those
guidelines can serve as rough indicators of the most serious offenders in that district.
275.  See, ag., United States v. Palmer, 3 F.3d 300 (9th Cir. 1993), cert. denied,5 10 U.S. 1138
(1994).  See also discussion supra notes 15-27 and accompanying text. In Palmer, there was evi-
dence that the United States Attorney's Office had no policy for determining which cases were
prosecuted in state court and which cases were charged in federal court.  See supra note 24.
276.  Professor Beale contends that "the decision to bring charges in federal rather than state
court is made on an ad hoc basis.... [Mjany [United States Attorney's Offices have] no stan-
dards to guide individual prosecutors."  Beale, supra note 2, at 999-1000.  See also Curtis,s upra
note 177, at 86 ("[E]rratic prosecution of and disparate penalties for similarly situated defend-
ants are commonplace.").  Professor Givelber expressed a similar concern in 1973: "In reality,
then, a decision to selectively prosecute an offender for a crime may involve neither a rational
policy nor a considered value judgment nor expertise."  Givelber, supra note 28, at 104.
In the Central District of California, where I practiced as a federal prosecutor from 1987
until 1994, screening decisions for many cases involving duplicative federal statutes were made
according to predetermined guidelines based largely, but not wholly, on drug weights and dollar
amounts.  Sometimes, however, offenders who did not satisfy the predetermined guidelines, and
who were no different than offenders being charged in California state courts, were charged in
federal court and subjected to harsher penalties.
277.  REPORT, supra note 2, at 37 (1990); see also Beale, supra note 2, at 990 (describing
complaints of district court judges in the District of Columbia about prosecution of minor drug
cases in federal courts).  Because the Department of Justice at one time considered workload of
individual United States Attorney's Offices as a factor when allocating resources, there was a
danger that federal prosecutors pursued minor drug cases to inflate their statistics and obtain
more resources. See DOJ ALERT, Nov. 1, 1993.

prosecutions  in  robbery,78  bribery  and  extortion,279  and  arson2s0
cases  of offenders  whose crimes  appear identical to cases routinely
prosecuted in state courts.
Furthermore, the federal  government  has  adopted  policies,  at
both the national and local level, that promote prosecution of offend-
ers under duplicative  federal statutes but ignore the possibility that
similarly situated others are charged in state court.  For example, in
early 1991, in order to take advantage of lengthy federal sentences,
the Department of Justice announced "Operation Triggerlock," a vig-
orous federal effort to prosecute cases involving possession and use of
firearms in violation of federal law,21 despite the fact that far more
firearms offenders were prosecuted in state court?82  In the Southern
District of New York, from 1983 until 1989, a program dubbed "Fed-
eral Day" mandated federal prosecution of all drug arrestees on ran-
domly selected days?83  Obviously, the only thing that distinguished
offenders  prosecuted  in federal  court from  those charged  in state
court was the day of the week  on which  they happened  to be ar-
rested.214  Likewise, the federal government periodically prosecutes
defendants who are arrested  in random law enforcement  "sweeps."
These  sweeps take place during a short period of time and involve
numerous arrests either in a specific geographical area, for violation of
278.  See, eg., cases cited supra note 112.
279.  See, e.g., cases cited supra note 113.

criminalizing possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, see 18 U.S.C. § 922(g) (1) (1996), use
of a firearm during a drug trafficking crime or a crime of violence, see id. § 924(c)(1), and pos-

D.  AMENDING THE "PRINCIPLES  OF FEDERAL PROSECUTION"
Although available  evidence  does not reveal the prevalence  of
unprincipled  selection  of offenders  for duplicative  federal  prosecu-
tion,286 existing administrative  guidelines do not prohibit such selec-
tion.  This  deficiency,  coupled with  anecdotal  evidence  that federal
prosecutors sometimes do choose offenders who appear to be no dif-
ferent than those prosecuted for analogous offenses in state court, is
sufficiently troubling to warrant amendment of the "Principles of Fed-
eral Prosecution" to ensure compliance with the equal protection ra-
tionality requirement.  Before describing specific proposals, however,
it is  worthwhile  to consider  two  objections  to the  conclusion  that
amendments are needed to conform Department of Justice policy to
the constitutional requirement  of rational charging decisions.
1.  What Does Equal ProtectionR  equire?
First, equal protection imposes constraints only when a prosecu-
tor "knows"  of similarly situated offenders who will receive different
treatment as a result of a charging decision. Therefore, one could ar-
gue that even if federal prosecutors are bound to obey the rational
relationship component of equal protection, they do not know enough
about  cases against  offenders prosecuted in state court to trigger  a
constitutional obligation to rationally distinguish them from defend-
ants selected for federal prosecution.  Second, one might contend that
intentionally random selection of offenders for federal prosecution is
a rational method of classification because it promotes deterrence.  If
so, then as long as federal prosecutors  do not choose defendants for
improper  reasons  like  race  or personal  animosity,  unprincipled  or
285.  See, eg., United States v. Bourgeois, 964 F.2d 935,936 (9th Cir. 1992) ("On June 14 and
15, 1990, federal agents and local law enforcement officers arrested more than 100 alleged gang
members in South Central Los Angeles. These arrests were part of a publicized, nationwide
effort, dubbed 'Operation  Streetsweep,'  that resulted in at least 160 arrests in 11 states.");
United States v. Peterson, 768 F.2d 64, 65 (2d Cir. 1985) ("This case arose out of one of the New
York City Police Department's 'buy operations-numerous purchases in a targeted area  of
small amounts of drugs, supposedly for personal use, by undercover agents, followed by arrests
and federal prosecution of the sellers. The sweep here was 'Operation Pressure Point'; the target
area was the area around Eighth Avenue and 115th Street in Harlem.").
286.  Because doctrine does not require prosecutors to explain charging decisions, see supra
note 272 and accompanying text, it is difficult, if not impossible, to determine the prevalence of
unprincipled charging.
HeinOnline -- 70 S. Cal. L. Rev. 708 1996-19971997] FEDERALIZATION OF CRIMINAL LAW
haphazard selection may be  sufficiently random to satisfy equal pro-
tection.  Because  the  Department  guidelines  already  prohibit  im-
proper reasons,  there is no need to add an affirmative  obligation to
have rational reasons.
a.  What do federal prosecutors "know"?:  The Supreme  Court
established  the equal protection knowledge requirement in Oyler v.
Boles. s7  After Oyler's conviction for second-degree murder, a state
prosecutor charged  him as  a habitual  offender under a statute that
imposed a mandatory life sentence.  Oyler claimed that the charging
decision violated  equal protection  because  the prosecutor  had  not
sought to  enhance the sentences  of other eligible repeat  offenders.
The Court noted that Oyler had not alleged that the prosecutor knew
of the other eligible offenders and determined that this defect was fa-
tal to his equal protection claim.3
At issue here is whether Oyler's knowledge requirement insulates
federal  prosecutors  from having  to rationally  distinguish  offenders
whom they charge under duplicative federal statutes from those whom
the state prosecutes instead.  On one hand, federal prosecutors have
some general awareness that there are apprehended offenders being
prosecuted in state court who are eligible for prosecution under dupli-
cative federal statutes.  That is, unlike those who escape prosecution
altogether,  offenders  charged  in  state  court  are  in  some  sense
"known" to federal prosecutors.  On the other hand, if federal prose-
cutors have not considered the merits of the cases against these of-
fenders, they may not  "know" about them, just as the Oyler Court
concluded  that  the  prosecutor  there  did  not know  about  the un-
charged but eligible habitual offenders in that case.
287.  368 U.S. 448 (1962).
288.  See id. at 456. See also Rickett v. Jones, 901 F.2d 1058 (11th Cir. 1990). Rickett chal-
lenged a prosecutor's decision to charge him under an Alabama habitual offender sentencing
statute that requires prosecutors to bring charges against all eligible offenders.  See id- at 1059.
Rickett claimed that the prosecutor's  failure to file identical charges against his codefendant
Battles, who arguably was also eligible for habitual offender sentencing, violated equal protec-
tion. See id. The lower court determined that the prosecutor did not charge Battles as a habitual
offender because the prosecutor had neglected to request readily available records that showed
that Battles was eligible for such treatment.  See id- at 1061, 1063 n.2 (Johnson, J., concurring).
The appellate court held that the prosecutor's negligent failure to identify Battles as eligible did
not violate Rickett's equal protection rights because Rickett demonstrated the existence of only
one potentially eligible but unselected offender. See id. at 1060-61. The court noted, however,
that "if failure to apply the [habitual offender statute] were to become more than occasional and
random, the federal Constitution might be violated, requiring federal court intervention."  Id. at
1061.
HeinOnline -- 70 S. Cal. L. Rev. 709 1996-1997710  SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA LAW REVIEW  [Vol. 70:643
The latter position,  denying that federal prosecutors have suffi-
cient knowledge to trigger constitutional concerns, takes too narrow a
view of equal protection.  The focus of inquiry should not be limited
to the manner in which federal prosecutors select offenders from the
pool of cases they have already chosen to review, but should also ex-
tend to the earlier decision to review some cases and ignore  others.
Because federal prosecutors are aware  of the larger pool of appre-
hended offenders, equal protection obligates them to have a rational
basis for distinguishing cases they review from cases they do not. Not
only must federal prosecutors  act rationally when they select from
among the pool of offenders  whose cases they do review, they also
must act rationally when they choose which apprehended violators of
duplicative federal statutes will make up that pool.2"9
Even if federal prosecutors  have no constitutional obligation to
rationally select the pool of potential federal prosecutees, the Depart-
ment of Justice should impose such an obligation as a matter of policy.
Adherence to a narrow construction of equal protection would inform
federal prosecutors that they have no duty to consider the problem of
disparate treatment and can avoid equal protection concerns as long
as they remain subjectively ignorant of cases involving similarly situ-
ated offenders.  A responsible commitment to the principles underly-
ing equal protection should compel the Department to require more
of its prosecutors, mandating that they determine whether their charg-
ing practices result in disparate treatment, rather than enabling them
to close their eyes to that probability.
In addition, the Department has publicized its successful efforts
to achieve  cooperation among federal, state, and local law enforce-
ment agencies.290  Federal prosecutors often work with their state and
local counterparts, and they routinely bring charges against offenders
289.  Justice Marshall made this point in his dissent in Wayte v. United States, 470 U.S. 598
(1985), in the context of allegations of discriminatory selective prosecution. Marshall wrote:  "If
the Government intentionally discriminated in defining the pool of potential prosecutees, it can-
not immunize itself from liability merely by showing that it used permissible methods in choos-
ing whom to prosecute from this previously tainted pool."  Id. at 630 (Marshall, J., dissenting).
If, as I have contended, equal protection requires rational charging decisions as well as prohibit-
ing discriminatory ones, then Justice Marshall's observation applies with equal force when fed-
eral  prosecutors  determine  which  offenders'  cases they  will  review  for possible  federal
prosecution.

who have been arrested by local police or joint federal and local task
forces.291  It would be inconsistent for the Department to tout these
accomplishments  and  pursue  cases  resulting  from  arrests  by  local
agencies while denying that it has an obligation to rationally deter-
mine which offenders will be prosecuted in which forum.  Rather, the
Department should adopt an approach  consistent with the spirit  of
both equal protection and federal, state, and local cooperation by hav-
ing a rational and consistent basis for determining which offenders are
prosecuted in state court and which are prosecuted in federal court.
b.  Is random selection rational?: If one concludes that random
selection, such as that employed in federal prosecutive  policies  like
"Federal Day," comports with equal protection, it may follow that in-
tentionally unprincipled selection does as well.2 2  In Logan v. Zim-
merman  Brush  Co.,293  the  Supreme  Court  considered  the
constitutionality  of random selection.  Six justices  concluded  that a
state's termination of an employment discrimination claim because of
a state agency's accidental random scheduling error established a clas-
sification  that violated  the rationality  requirement  of equal protec-
tion.294  The  Court,  however,  has  never  determined  whether
intentional random selection is similarly infirm.295  Lower courts that
291.  See United States v. Davis, 906 F2d 829, 831 (2d Cir. 1990) ("As the challenge facing
the nation's law enforcement authorities has grown in sophistication and complexity, coopera-
tion between federal and local agencies has become increasingly important and increasingly
commonplace."); Curtis, supran ote 177, at 89 ("Joint state-federal task forces abound. State law
enforcement officers are encouraged to make referrals for federal prosecution of crimes within
state jurisdiction.").
292.  Of course, if unprincipled selection is not purely random, possibilities for abuse exist.
See Frase, supran ote 170, at 283 ("Such 'arbitrary' selection raises greater potential risks that the
prosecutor will 'randomly' select his enemies...

294.  Although the majority decided the case on due process grounds, see id. at 433-38, Jus-
tice Blackmun, who authored the majority opinion, was joined by Justices Brennan, Marshall,
and O'Connor in a concurring opinion finding an equal protection violation.  See id. at 438-42.
Justices Powell and Rehnquist dissented from the majority's due process holding, but agreed that
there was an equal protection violation. See id. at 443-44; Rickett v. Jones, 901 F2d 1058,1063 &
n.3 (11th Cir. 1990) (Johnson, J., concurring) (describing treatment of equal protection issue in
Logan).
295.  A remark in Lehr v. Robertson, 463 U.S. 248 (1983), suggests that intentional random
selection is constitutional, at least in some contexts. In Reed v. Reed, 404 U.S. 71,76 (1971), the
Court determined that a state statute that preferred men to women as administrators of dece-
dents'  estates violated equal protection despite the state's contention that it "reduce[d]  the
workload of probate courts by eliminating one class of contests."  Twelve years later, in Lehr,
while discussing the statute that it had struck down in Reed, the Court intimated that a "coin
flip" would have been a preferable means of reducing the administrative workload of probate
courts. See Lehr, 463 U.S at 265-66 n.24. See also Delaware v. Prouse, 440 U.S. 648, 667 (1979)

have considered the issue in passing have reached  contrary conclu-
sions. 96  Some observers contend that purely random selection is con-
sistent  with  equal  protection  because  all  are  equally  likely to  be
selected. 97  Others  conclude  that random  selection  is  problematic,
and possibly unconstitutional, because the basis for selection has noth-
ing to do with legitimate government objectives.298  Arguably, in situa-
tions  in which  the government must selectively  prosecute, random
selection is unrelated  to any objective  that the government seeks  to
further.299
(Rehnquist, J., dissenting) (assuming that a random traffic stop by a police officer does not vio-
late equal protection).  Even if intentional random selection as a means of selecting estate ad-
ministrators and motorists subject to traffic stops does not violate equal protection, it does not
necessarily follow that the same is true for random selection for prosecution, a decision with far
higher stakes. See infra notes 302-303 and accompanying text.

offend common notions of justice to have them made on the basis of a dart throw, a coin toss or

violates due process, separation of powers concerns precludes judicial review), with Futernick v.

1995)  ("[Random] selective prosecution, although it involves dramatically unequal legal treat-
ment, has no standing in equal protection law."), and United States v. Steele, 461 F.2d 1148,1152
(9th Cir. 1972) (stating that "mere random selection" would be a satisfactory method of selecting
for prosecution among those who failed to complete census forms).
297.  See,  e.g.,  RcnARD A.  PosNER, ECONOMIC ANALYSiS  oF LAw  230 (1992)  ("In an
equally significant sense both the criminal justice system that creates low probabilities of appre-
hension and conviction and the lottery are fair so long as the ex ante costs and benefits are

ited by lot, all are 'treated equally' with respect to their chance to win [or lose] the lottery.").
This view requires that one define the government's "treatment" of individuals for purposes of
equal protection analysis as its exposure of them to the potential of benefits or burdens.  It
seems more likely that the Court would assess the equality of "treatment" at the point at which
the government actually imposes the benefits or burdens. The opinions of Justices Blackmun and
Powell in Logan, which represented the views of six of the Justices on the Court, see supran otes
293-94 and accompanying text, suggest that the Court would adopt the latter approach.  In Lo-
gan, all potential employment discrimination claimants were equally likely to be the victim of a
random scheduling error which would terminate their claims. Rather than conclude that equal
potential exposure to such a claim-terminating error satisfied equal protection, the six justices
instead asked whether there was a rational basis for the government to treat Logan differently
than the others by actually terminating his claim and determined that there was not.

person within the broad class serves the goal as well as burdening another.").
299.  The draft lottery, the random selection of jury venires, and social experiments are com-
monly cited as examples of random selection.  See, e.g., Simons, supra note 298, at 527 n.276

HeinOnline -- 70 S. Cal. L. Rev. 712 1996-19971997] FEDERALIZATION OF CRIMINAL LAW
However, unlike the idiosyncratic, negligent random selection in
Logan, intentional randomness is not necessarily unrelated to govern-
ment objectives.  Random  distribution  of burdens  or benefits  itself
may further objectives that other selection methods cannot achieve.
Indeed, some contend that the imposition of random harsh sentences
is a rational means of maximizing the deterrent effect of limited law
enforcement resources.00  If this is true, then federal prosecutors may
achieve  a similar deterrent effect by selecting offenders  for harsher
treatment in federal court in  a random  or unprincipled  manner.01
Under this view, as long as they do not make charging decisions for
bad reasons, the Constitution does not require that prosecutors have
good ones.
However,  the interests at stake in the selective  enforcement  of
duplicative federal statutes are sufficiently high that the Department
of Justice should refrain from adopting the view that purely random or
unprincipled  selection  is  constitutional  or desirable  as  a means  of
making charging decisions.  Although random classifications affecting
less important interests may not merit concern,3 2 random determina-
tion of an offender's procedural protections or sentence seems funda-
mentally  unfair, particularly  without proof  of a  tangible  deterrent
effect.  It is  difficult to reconcile the guarantee  of equal protection
with the intentional  use of a  policy that randomly subjects  one  of-
fender to a small fine and another who is similarly situated to the near

Westen, To Lure the Tarantula From Its Hole: A Response, 83 COLUM. L. Rnv. 1186, 1196 n.29
(1983).
300.  See, eg., Futernick,7 8 F.3d at 1057 n.8 (6th Cir. 1996) ("[R]andom choice may be one
of the most sensible methods to allocate 'equally'  finite enforcement  resources.")  (emphasis
omitted); Falls v. Town of Dyer, 875 F.2d 146, 148 (7th Cir. 1989) ("Government rationally may
decide that imposing stiff penalties on 10% of offenders is the best way to enforce the law
against all."); Beale, supra note 2, at 1003 ("[T]here is an economic argument that the arbitrary
selection of a few cases for harsh sentencing is the most efficient, Le., least expensive, means of
promoting deterrence.").  However, in Delaware v. Prouse, 440 U.S. 648 (1979), the Court con-
cluded that random police stops of motorists for license and registration checks were unlikely to
deter unlicensed persons from driving.  See id. at 660.
301.  Some, including the local district attorney, questioned the efficacy of the random Fed-
eral Day program as a deterrent. See Robert M. Morgenthau, We Are Losing the War on Drugs,
N.Y. TIMs, Feb. 16, 1988, at A21 ("If the war on drugs is to succeed, the Federal Government
must give us more than Panglossian rhetoric or showy 'Federal days'-the marching of street
peddlers off to Federal, rather than state, court."); Deborah Squiers, Banker Turned Defender
Manages Legal Aid Unit ForL ocal Federal Courts, N.Y. L.J., Nov. 15,1990, at 1 (quoting Federal
Public Defender Leonard Joy as characterizing Federal Day program as "absurd. It makes good
press but I don't think it ever made any dent.").
302.  For example,  random  selection  of persons  to serve  on jury  panels  is certainly
constitutional.
HeinOnline -- 70 S. Cal. L. Rev. 713 1996-1997SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA LAW REVIEW  [Vol. 70:643
certainty of a ten-year term of imprisonment. °3  Even if constitutional
doctrine does not preclude such a practice, the Department of Justice
should as a matter of policy.  It would be unthinkable for the Depart-
ment to propose legislation requiring judges to spin a roulette wheel
to  determine  criminal  defendants'  procedural  protections  and
sentences.  The Department should not risk the same result by giving
its prosecutors free reign to make unprincipled charging decisions.
This is not to suggest that the Department of Justice has chosen
to promote random or unprincipled selection. It has not.304  However,
by employing guidelines  that do not require federal prosecutors  to
compare offenders whom they charge with those prosecuted in state
court and that only prohibit federal prosecutors from bringing charges
for bad reasons, the Department allows its prosecutors to ignore simi-
larly situated state-prosecuted  offenders and to make selection deci-
sions without good reason.
2.  Proposed Changes
Regardless  of whether equal protection requires  prosecutors to
make rational charging decisions and bars unprincipled classifications,
the Department should be sufficiently  concerned with the disparity
wrought by unguided charging discretion to provide additional direc-
tion to its prosecutors.305  It could do so by making four changes to the
"Principles  of Federal Prosecution."
First, the Department should charge its prosecutors with learning,
as a general matter, the nature and severity of crimes committed by all
known offenders eligible for federal prosecution.  Because known of-
fenders  typically are prosecuted either in state or federal court, this
303.  Although the Selective Service draft lottery also employs random selection to make
choices involving similarly important interests, there may be compelling societal reasons justify-
ing use of such classification in that context, such as "placing a cross section of the community
...o n the battlefield."  See Closer Scrutiny, supran ote 297, at 865.  In addition, random selection
may be preferable to any other method of selection. In contrast, even if placing a fair cross
section of the community in federal prison were a legitimate governmental aim, random selec-
tion for federal prosecution would not further that objective because the sample of offenders
would be skewed by disparities in arrest rates.
304.  When Senator Joseph Biden proposed legislation requiring a nationwide Federal Day
program patterned after the random program employed in the Southern District of New York,
the Department of Justice opposed it, although not because of concerns that it would promote
unprincipled disparity. Rather, the Department saw the program as an unjustified congressional
intrusion into federal prosecutors' charging discretion.  See Ann Pelham & Richard Connelly,
U.S. Judges Oppose FederalD  ay Measure, Tax. LAw., May 28, 1990, at 12.
305.  For a discussion  of the virtues of consistency in prosecutorial  decisionmaking, see
Abrams, supra note 28, at 4 n.8.
HeinOnline -- 70 S. Cal. L. Rev. 714 1996-19971997] FEDERALIZATION OF CRIMINAL LAW
would require federal prosecutors to keep abreast of cases involving
state-prosecuted  offenders  whose  conduct  makes  them  eligible for
federal prosecution as well.  Individual United States Attorney's  Of-
fices  could do so by working with local law enforcement  agencies or
prosecutors  to learn  of the types  of cases that are referred to state
prosecutors.06
Federal prosecutors would not need to conduct detailed review of
the cases against eligible offenders, a task that would deplete precious
federal prosecutive resources.  Indeed, the focus should not be on the
strength of the evidence  in individual  cases,  but rather on general
characteristics  that  could  serve  to  rationally  distinguish  offenders
prosecuted  by the state from those  charged in federal court.  Such
characteristics might include the quantity of drugs or money involved
in the offense.
Second,  the Department  should require that individual  United
States  Attorney's  Offices  develop  and  consistently  apply  internal
prosecutive classification schemes that use particular characteristics of
crimes and criminals in order to distinguish cases that will not be re-
viewed  from cases the federal prosecutors will review  to determine
whether  there  is  sufficient  evidence  to  prosecute.  Although  the
schemes need not be rigid, exceptions should be tailored to minimize
the possibility of disparate treatment of similarly situated offenders.07
Local prosecutive  guidelines are preferable to nationwide legislative
and  administrative  classification  schemes  because  local  guidelines
would allow  federal  prosecutors  to tailor  standards  to local  crime
problems.  Although this proposed change is more modest than those
calling for policies limiting federal prosecution to cases that are either
distinctly  federal in  nature  or require  federal law enforcement  re-
sources,308  the  mandated  use  of  a  rational  selection  scheme  may
306. 7The Supreme Court recently determined that information about the existence of simi-
larly situated offenders prosecuted in state court is available to defendants attempting to raise
selective prosecution challenges.  See United States v. Armstrong, 116 U.S. 1480, 1489 (1996)
(describing task of proving existence of similarly situated others as not "insuperable" for defend-
ants).  Federal prosecutors, who have the benefit of cooperative  relationships with state and
local  law  enforcement  agencies,  should  have  ittle or  no  difficulty  obtaining  the  same
information.
307.  For example, a United States Attorney's Office may, as a general matter, review for
prosecution only those cocaine cases that involve possession or distribution of five or more kilo-
grams of cocaine.  But the same office may make exceptions for cases involving less than five
kilograms if, for example, there is evidence that an offender employed firearms or violence while
trafficking in drugs, or had prior convictions for drug trafficking.
308.  For proposals suggesting that federal prosecution be limited to cases that involve some
distinct or unique federal interest or characteristic, see supra note 28.
HeinOnline -- 70 S. Cal. L. Rev. 715 1996-1997SOUTHERN  CALIFORNIA LAW REVIEW  [Vol. 70:643
prompt individual United States Attorney's Offices to use federalism-
based proposals  as models.  The Department should also encourage
its prosecutors  to work with local prosecutors  to develop mutually
agreeable  classification schemes allocating federal and state prosecu-
five resources to maximize the advantages of overlapping jurisdiction
while  guaranteeing  roughly  equal  treatment  for similarly  situated
offenders.309
Third, the Department should prohibit random selection of of-
fenders for federal prosecution.  Absent compelling evidence that ran-
dom selection  effectively  deters crime, far too much is  at stake  to
allow federal prosecutors to select offenders by chance.310
Fourth, rather than encourage federal prosecution as a means of
gaining a comparative advantage, the Department should require that
there be some characteristics  of a case, other than  a mere desire to
avoid state procedural protections and take advantage of federal sen-
tencing doctrines, to warrant federal prosecution.  If there are legiti-
mate reasons for prosecuting an offender in federal court independent
of the imposition of harsher treatment, defendants' loss of state court
advantages  should not preclude  federal prosecution.  When federal
prosecution is uniformly advantageous, however, the desire to obtain
a tactical or strategic advantage alone should not suffice.311
In addition,  although not mandated  by either the letter or the
spirit of equal protection, the Department should require the exercise
309.  Presently, United States Attorneys are "urged to cooperate fully with state and local
prosecutors and investigators" in drug cases, DOJ MANUAL, supra note 252, § 9-101.200(F), and
instructed to "meet or confer with state and local prosecutors in connection  with referral of
federal cases for prosecution."  Id. § 9-101.200 (H). This obligation should be expanded to all
cases involving overlapping federal and state jurisdiction and to require rational determination
of the appropriate forum for prosecution for all such cases. See also U.S. SENTENCING COMM'N,
SPECIAL REPORT TO CONGRESS:  CoCAINE Am  FEDERAL SENTENCINO PoucY 6-7 (1997) (rec-
ommending "efforts to rationalize" use of federal and state resources to combat drug trafficking
and use).
310.  Were there reliable evidence that a prosecutor's ability to give different treatment
to like cases provides a higher level of deterrence and "more bang for the buck" than
would a system of clearly established, uniform sanctions, one could argue that gains in
crime control outweigh the inherent unfairness of unpredictable differentiation.  Such
clear gains have not been shown, however, and the burden of persuasion ought to be on
those who advocate a policy that seems dangerously at odds with basic notions of equal
protection....
Vorenberg, supra note 28, at 1550 (footnote omitted).
311.  Such a change would make Department policy consistent in capital and noncapital
cases. The United States Attorneys' Manual death penalty guidelines state that "[i]n states where
the imposition of the death penalty is not authorized by law, the fact that the maximum federal
penalty is death is insufficient, standing alone, to show a more substantial interest in federal
prosecution."  DOJ MANUAL, supra note 252, § 9-10.000.
HeinOnline -- 70 S. Cal. L. Rev. 716 1996-19971997] FEDERALIZATION OF CRIMINAL LAW
of considerable caution before bringing charges in cases (1) involving
offenders who would have been prosecuted in state court but for their
anticipated  or actual  assertion  of state constitutional  or procedural
protections and (2) where federal prosecution will not only have the
effect of circumventing those protections, but will also prejudice the
offenders in other ways, such as the imposition of a longer sentence.
Although the federal government  may have a legitimate ground for
prosecuting such cases, particularly when the operation of state consti-
tutional or procedural  doctrines requires  suppression of critical  evi-
dence  or  precludes  state  prosecution  altogether,  the  Department
should not tread on the state policies  that require  these results and
penalize defendants whose state rights are violated without a compel-
ling reason for doing so. It may be appropriate to require both a sub-
stantial federal interest in the prosecution and advance approval by a
high-level Department of Justice official to prosecute such cases, as is
required when federal prosecutors  seek to bring charges  after there
has been a conviction or acquittal in state court.312
IV.  JUDICIAL ENFORCEMENT
If the Department of Justice were to do nothing to ensure that its
prosecutors have a rational basis for selecting only some known eligi-
ble offenders  to be subject  to  harsh federal  doctrines  and  federal
courts concluded  that unprincipled  selection is routine, judicial  en-
forcement  of  the  rationality  requirement  might  be  appropriate.
Although lower federal courts have almost 313 unanimously refused to
conduct such review,314 the Supreme Court has never foreclosed the
312.  In cases involving federal prosecution after a state court acquittal or conviction, the
Department of Justice's "Petite Policy" requires a determination that a "substantial federal inter-
est" was left "demonstrably unvindicated" by the state prosecution or sentence and prior ap-
proval by an Assistant Attorney General. See id. §§ 9-2.124(IV)-(V).  Because the Petite Policy
applies only if there has been a prior acquittal, conviction, or dismissal on the merits after jeop-
ardy has attached, it does not govern federal prosecutors' decisions to bring charges after pretrial
suppression of evidence or dismissal of charges. See generally Litman & Greenberg, supra note
7, at 75-76.  Although Litman and Greenberg believe that the Petite Policy provides "insights"
for the federalization debate, the Department of Justice has not imposed Petite-Policy-like con-
straints on decisions to prosecute some offenders in federal court when others who have engaged
in similar criminal conduct are prosecuted in state court.
313.  An oft-cited and rare exception is United States v. Robinson, 311 F. Supp. 1063 (W.D.
Mo. 1969), in which the court held that a prosecution of a private detective, but not government
officials, for illegal wiretapping was irrational and thus violated equal protection. See generally
Cardinale & Feldman, supra note 28, at 665 & n.45 (discussing Robinson).
314.  For example, in Esmail v. Macrane, 53 F.3d 176, 179 (7th Cir. 1995) the court held:
[T]he [only] form of selective prosecution.. .that is actionable under the federal Consti-
tution.. .is where the decision to prosecute is made either in retaliation for the exercise
HeinOnline -- 70 S. Cal. L. Rev. 717 1996-1997718  SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA LAW REVIEW  [Vol. 70:643
possibility of limited judicial  oversight.  Indeed, in  Wade, the Court
apparently reached the opposite conclusion.  The Court held not only
that federal prosecutors' refusals to request downward departures for
cooperation must be rational, but that, given a sufficient showing, fed-
eral  courts have  an obligation  to determine  if the prosecution  has
complied with that mandate.15  Wade also suggests that its analysis
applies to charging decisions.316
In order to determine why lower federal courts have consistently
reached  a different result and to explore whether judicial review to
assess the rationality of charging decisions  is  ever appropriate,  it is
necessary  to consider the principal barriers to review.  First, courts
commonly invoke  the doctrines  of "separation  of powers"  and the
"presumption of regularity" of charging decisions to preclude judicial
review entirely absent proof of improper discrimination.  Second, in
part as an outgrowth of these doctrines, courts place evidentiary ob-
stacles in the path of litigants who attempt to gain review of charging
decisions.  Third, the deferential nature of rational basis scrutiny may
prompt courts to refuse to conduct review because they perceive it as
a meaningless exercise.  Finally, courts may be reluctant to grant the
generally  accepted  remedy  for  selective  prosecution,  dismissal  of
charges, because it is too draconian.  Examination  of these obstacles
of a constitutional right, such as the right to free speech or to the free exercise of
religion, or because of membership in a vulnerable group.

472, 475 (9th Cir. 1992); United States v. Fares, 978 F2d 52, 59 (2d Cir. 1992).
315.  See Wade v. United States, 504 U.S.  181 (1992).  The Wade Court "agree[d]"  that
prosecutorial power to move for a reduced sentence "is subject to constitutional limitations that
district courts can enforce"  Id at 185 (emphasis added). The Court further held that "federal
district courts have the authority to review the Government's refusal to file a substantial-assist-
ance motion and to grant a remedy...." Id.
The Wade Court concluded that Wade's showing was insufficient to merit review. Unfortu-
nately, it neglected to explain what a defendant must demonstrate in order to obtain review.  See

1840 (1992), 83 J. Caum. L. & CRMNAorooY 744, 757, 764 (1993).  Wade had claimed that the
district court precluded him from showing that rationality review was appropriate because it
erroneously believed that no relief was possible under any circumstances.  Thus, he asked the
Court for a remand to prove to the district court that the government had acted arbitrarily or in
bad faith by refusing to move for a reduced sentence because of "'factors that are not rationally
related to any legitimate state objective."' Wade, 504 U.S. at 186 (quoting Wade's reply brief).
The Court rejected that request. It determined that the district court had given Wade an oppor-
tunity "to state for the record what evidence he would introduce to support his position."  Id. at
184.  In response, Wade's attorney only "explained the extent of Wade's assistance to the Gov-

A.  DoCrRIn s PRECLUDING JUDICIAL REVIEW
1.  Separation of Powers
Lower courts often cite separation of powers concerns to justify
their refusal  to review charging  decisions  absent evidence  that the
prosecution is motivated by forbidden factors like race or the exercise
of  a  constitutional  right.317  It  is  noteworthy,  however,  that  the
Supreme  Court has never invoked separation  of powers concerns to
bar judicial review of prosecutors'  charging decisions.3 18  The separa-
tion of powers doctrine prevents each branch of government from in-
terfering  with  the  constitutional  functions  of  the  coordinate
branches.319 A forceful statement of the role the doctrine plays in lim-
iting judicial review of executive branch charging decisions appears in
United States v.  Redondo-Lemos3.20  In that  case,  the court  deter-
mined  that  although  due  process  prohibits  irrational  or  arbitrary
charging  decisions,  separation  of powers precludes  judicial involve-
ment absent proof of improper discrimination:
Such judicial entanglement in the core decisions of another branch
of government-especially as to those bearing directly and substan-
tially on matters litigated in federal court-is inconsistent with the
division of responsibilities assigned to each branch by the Constitu-
tion.  The Office of the United States Attorney cannot function as
317.  See, e.g., United States v. Jennings, 991 F.2d 725, 730 (11th Cir. 1993); United States v.
Hayes, 589 F.2d 811, 819 (5th Cir. 1979); Gifford, supra note 28, at 663 ("Review [of charging
decisions] is considered inappropriate...  because of constitutionally significant separation of
powers considerations."); Hollon, supra note 3, at 522.
318.  There is no mention of the separation of powers doctrine in the Supreme Court's selec-
tive prosecution decisions.  See United States v. Armstrong, 116 S. Ct. 1480 (1996);  Wayte v.
United States, 470 U.S. 598 (1985); United States v. Batchelder, 442 U.S. 114 (1979); Oyler v.
Boles, 368 U.S. 448 (1962).
319.  See LAURENCE H. TRIBE, AmERIcAN CONSTITUTIONAL LAW 18 (2d ed. 1988).  Tribe
describes the "model" of "separated and divided powers" as demonstrating
the degree to which various governmental arrangements comport with, or threaten to
undermine, either the independence and integrity of one of the branches or levels of
government, or the ability of each to fulfill its mission in checking the others so as to
preserve the interdependence without which independence can become domination.

prosecutor before the court while also serving under its general su-
pervision.  The court, in turn, cannot both supervise the exercise of
prosecutorial discretion and act as an impartial arbiter of the cases
presented to it.  In the end, the type of intense inquiry that would
enable a court to evaluate whether or not a prosecutor's  charging
decision was made in an arbitrary fashion would destroy the very
system of justice it was intended to protect.32'
Although these considerations mandate some limitation on judi-
cial oversight of charging decisions, they do not compel complete ab-
dication  of review.  Indeed,  courts  do review  charging  decisions  if
there is evidence that they were motivated by racial or other improper
considerations.  The resulting inquiry may require intrusive measures,
such  as  discovery  and  testimony by executive  branch  officials,  and
remedies, like dismissal, that undercut executive  decisions. 22  Simi-
larly, when confronted with evidence that federal legislators have en-
acted  statutory  classifications  that  are  not  rationally  related  to
legitimate government  objectives, the Supreme Court does not hesi-
tate to review core decisions  of a coordinate  branch of government
and invalidate the legislation if necessary.
Thus, the question is not whether separation of powers doctrine
bars review entirely, but rather under what circumstances  review is
appropriate.  Intrusive and stringent oversight of federal prosecutors'
charging decisions obviously threatens executive prerogative, particu-
larly if a defendant can obtain such review without having to make a
considerable threshold showing to demonstrate the need for review.
However, if a federal court is confronted with evidence that federal
prosecutors have selected an offender in an unprincipled manner and
that the charging decision subjects  the offender  to significantly  less
favorable procedural protections and sentencing doctrines than those
the offenders would have received in state court, separation of powers
321.  Id. at 1300. Kenneth Culp Davis disputes the claim that separation of powers precludes
federal courts from reviewing prosecutors' discretionary decisions for abuse, arguing that:
This reason is so clearly unsound as to be almost absurd.  If separation of powers pre-
vents review of the discretion of executive officers, then more than a hundred Supreme
Court decisions spread over a century and three quarters will have to be found contrary
to the Constitution! If courts could not interfere with abuse of discretion by executive
officers, our fundamental institutions would be altogether different from what they are.

concerns should not automatically foreclose review, particularly if the
court can resolve the claim by conducting limited review.
Restrained judicial oversight is possible.  In an analogous context,
when assessing only the rationality of legislative classifications, courts
conduct remarkably  nonintrusive review.  Where  a statute does  not
explicitly set forth a classiflaction scheme, courts will interpret the leg-
islation to ascertain the scheme it creates.324  Then, the courts will
either make  efforts to determine the legislature's  actual reasons for
creating the classification scheme,32  or they will hypothesize possible
reasons for creating such a scheme.26  Finally, courts will determine
whether these reasons are legitmate327 and whether the classification
scheme rationally furthers them.32s  Courts conducting such review do
not require that legislators testify about their motives329 or present
evidence to support empirical assumptions upon which the challenged
classification  schemes rest.330
Assessment of the rationality of prosecutors'  charging decisions
would  require  an  approach  that  is  only  slightly  more  intrusive.
Although courts can glean legislative classification schemes from the
text of statutes, federal prosecutors'  classifications  schemes  (if they
employ coherent schemes) may not be obvious from individual charg-
ing decisions.  Thus, in order to enable courts to assess the rationality
of  charging  decisions,  prosecutors  must  reveal  the  classification
scheme, if any, that resulted in the challenged selection.  Other than
324.  See, eg., Logan v. Zimmerman Brush Co., 455 U.S. 422, 438-39 (1992) (Blackmun, J.,
concurring) (interpreting statute that did not explicitly create classification). At times the classi-
fication scheme may be complex.  See, eg., Schweiker v. Wilson, 450 U.S. 221, 231-32 (1981).
325.  For example, in City of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Cr., Ina, 473 U.S. 432 (1985), the
Court struck down a city ordinance under the equal protection rational relationship test after
rejecting as unpersuasive and impermissible the reasons the city gave for distinguishing between
group homes for retarded persons and other group homes. See id. at 448-50. The Court did not
make any effort to hypothesize possible justifications for the challenged ordinance.
326.  See, eg. Heller v. Doe, 509 U.S. 312, 320 (1993) (holding that the legislature need not
state a reason for a classification scheme; rather, statutory classification should be upheld if any
conceivable state of facts can provide a rational basis for the scheme).
327.  See, eg., Zobel v. Williams, 457 U.S. 55,62-63 (1982) (determining that the state objec-
tive of rewarding citizens for past contributions to the state "is not a legitimate state purpose").
328.  See United States R.R. Bd. v. Fritz, 449 U.S. 166, 184 (1980) (Brennan, J., dissenting)
("When faced with a challenge  to a...  classification under the rational-basis test, the court
should ask, first, what the purposes of the [classification] are, and, second, whether the classifica-
tion is rationally related to achievement of those purposes.").
329.  See Nordlinger v. Hahn, 505 U.S. 1,15 (1992) ("To be sure, the Equal Protection Clause
does not demand for purposes of rational-basis review that a legislature or governing deci-
sionmaker actually articulate at any time the purpose or rationale supporting its classification.").
330.  See Heller, 509 U.S. at 320 ("A State, moreover, has no obligation to produce evidence
to sustain the rationality of a statutory classification.").
HeinOnline -- 70 S. Cal. L. Rev. 721 1996-1997722  SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA LAW REVIEW  [Vol. 70:643
this requirement, which alone should not preclude review,33 rational-
1 
ity review of charging decisions need not be any more intrusive than
similar review of legislative decisions.  Once informed of the classifica-
tion scheme, courts  can determine whether that scheme is rationally
related  to legitimate objectives,  just as  they  would with  legislative
classifications. 32
Even if no more intrusive than rationality review  of legislative
classifications, such oversight of charging decisions probably would be
more frequent.  Once courts determine that a legislative classification
is rational, there is no threat of repeated review  of that statute.  In
contrast, because every offender may challenge his selection for prose-
cution, there is a danger that requests to review virtually every charg-
ing decision will flood the federal courts.  Two factors minimize this
danger. First, a defendant would be required to make some threshold
showing to obtain review.333  Second, once courts determine that cer-
tain selection criteria are rational, and thus acceptable  as a means of
choosing offenders, defendants whose selection satisfied those criteria
would be far less likely to challenge their selection and, if they did,
courts could summarily reject the challenges.
2.  The "Presumptiono  f Regularity"
Courts  also invoke  the  "presumption  of regularity"  to refrain
from reviewing charging decisions unless offenders establish racial or
other improper discriminatory effect and purpose. 34  This doctrine re-
quires that courts presume that prosecutors  have discharged their du-
ties  properly  unless  a  defendant  presents  clear  evidence  of  a
constitutional violation.335  The presumption  is based on "a concern
not to unnecessarily impair the performance of a core executive con-
stitutional function" and the "relative competence of prosecutors and
courts. '336  As the Court stated in Wayte v. United States:
[T]he decision to prosecute is particularly ill-suited to judicial re-
view. Such factors as the strength of the case, the prosecution's gen-
eral deterrence value, the Government's enforcement priorities, and
331.  See infra notes 342-46 and accompanying text.
332.  See supra note 323 and accompanying text.
333.  See infra notes 358-70 and accompanying text.
334.  The Supreme Court did not explicitly apply the doctrine, which requires courts to pre-
sume the regularity of official acts absent contrary evidence, to prosecutors' charging decisions
until 1996.  See United States v. Armstrong, 116 S.C t. 1480 (1996).  On the "presumption of
regularity," see Applegate, supra note 28, at 38.

FEDERALIZATION OF CRIMINAL LAW
the case's  relationship  to the  Government's  overall enforcement
plan are not readily susceptible to the kind of analysis the courts are
competent  to undertake.  Judicial  supervision in this area, more-
over, entails systemic  costs of particular concern.  Examining the
basis of a prosecution delays the criminal proceeding, threatens to
chill law enforcement by subjecting  the prosecutor's motives and
decisionmaking  to  outside  inquiry,  and  may  undermine
prosecutorial effectiveness by revealing the Government's enforce-
ment policy.  All these are substantial concerns that make the courts
properly hesitant to examine the decision whether to prosecute.337
Assessment of these twin concerns-the cost of judicial inquiry
and  the competence  of judicial  review-reveals  that although  they
provide some support for requiring  offenders who allege discrimina-
tory charging to shoulder the burden of proving purposeful discrimi-
nation, they do not justify a blanket refusal to review the rationality of
charging decisions.  Even if courts  afford prosecutors a presumption
of regularity, a showing that casts significant doubt about the rational-
ity of charging classifications should be sufficient to overcome reluc-
tance and gain some judicial scrutiny.
a.  Costs of judicial inquiry:  Wayte identifies three costs of judi-
cial inquiry-delay, chilling of prosecutorial decisionmaking, and dis-
closure  of law  enforcement  policy.  None  of these concerns  merits
complete judicial refusal to assess the rationality of charging decisions.
Delay resulting from inquiry into a charging  decision, like delay re-
sulting from any inquiry unrelated to factual guilt, increases inconven-
ience to witnesses and victims, threatens to cause memories to fade,
burdens prosecutors and court dockets, and prevents the swift imposi-
tion of justice without furthering the search for the truth.  However,
courts  commonly  conduct  lengthy pretrial  inquiries  into  collateral
matters, such  as the legality of police  acquisition  of evidence.  The
avoidance-of-delay justification for judicial deference to charging de-
cisions does not explain why the litigation of equal protection rights is
less worthy than other matters for which delay is tolerated.
In addition, unlike claims of improper discrimination, which inva-
riably require discovery and possibly an evidentiary hearing,338 chal-
lenges  to  the  rationality  of  charging  decisions  do  not  necessitate
337.  470 U.S. 598, 607-08 (1985) (citations omitted).
338.  A claimant like Wayte, who makes an affirmative accusation that the government has
chosen to prosecute him for a forbidden reason, is unlikely to be mollified by a prosecutor's
facially neutral explanation for the charging decision. The claimant believes that he knows the
real reason for his selection and will reject the proffered reason as pretextual. Resolution of the
HeinOnline -- 70 S. Cal. L. Rev. 723 1996-1997SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA LAW REVIEW  [Vol. 70:643
significant  delay.  Convinced that the government is treating him dif-
ferently than  others like him, an  offender simply seeks to ascertain
why it is doing so.  At least initially, he is  requesting only that the
prosecution inform the court of the classification scheme that has led
to the disparate treatment339 and that the court assess its rationality,
not that the court order discovery or an evidentiary hearing.340
Fear of chilling prosecutorial  decisionmaking  should  prompt  a
court to  hesitate before  conducting  review  only  if judicial scrutiny
threatens to deter prosecutors from bringing  charges in meritorious
cases.  Again, there is a significant difference  between claims  of im-
proper discriminatory  charging  and inquiries  into the rationality  of
claim requires discovery and review of internal government documents to determine whether
the government possesses direct or circumstantial evidence to support the defendant's claim. An
evidentiary hearing may also be necessary to allow examination of government actors to uncover
evidence of illegal discrimination.
Notably, in Wayte, the defendant's "broad request" for discovery led to a district court order
that required both the production of documents and testimony by government witnesses, spawn-
ing litigation that the dissent characterized as a "saga," see Wayte, 470 U.S. at 617 (Marshall, J.,
dissenting), and justifying the Court's concern about delay. Other cases involving allegations of
improper discriminatory charging in which courts have ordered discovery have produced similar
results.  See United States v. Armstrong, 48 F.3d 1508, 1535 (1995) (Rymer, J., dissenting) ("In
this case alone, locating more than 3,000 files and figuring out which were crack and firearms
prosecutions, the racial identity of each defendant...  and the investigating authorities will be a
time-consuming and expensive process"), rev'd, 116 S.Ct. 1480 (1996); Government's Petition for
Writ of Certiorari at 23 n.3, Armstrong (No. 95-157) (discussing case in which "more than 1,000
hours of work by attorneys, support personnel, and law enforcement officers were required to
collect data and prepare affidavits in response to a [selective prosecution] discovery motion" and
trial was delayed "by more than four months").
339.  After having received  a description of that scheme, the defendant can accept it, or
challenge it in a variety of ways, only some of which may ultimately result in the delay necessary
for discovery or an evidentiary hearing.  However, unlike an improper discrimination claim, a
rationality inquiry does not necessarily require those time-consuming measures.
340.  In a somewhat analogous context, claims of equal protection violations in the exercise
of peremptory challenges during jury selection-so-called Batson objections-the Court has ap-
proved a relatively simple and speedy procedure for a trial court to determine whether there has
been a violation without the need for either discovery or an evidentiary hearing. See Purkett v.
Elem, 115 S. Ct. 1769,1770-71 (1995) (per curiam). Courts resolve those claims, which can arise
repeatedly during jury selection, based solely on immediate explanations and arguments from
the parties. There is no reason why courts cannot employ a similar procedure to resolve at least
some challenges to charging decisions, particularly rationality challenges.  Like Batson claims,
they could be resolved expeditiously with (1) a defendant's showing of prejudicial  disparate
treatment, (2) a prosecutor's oral disclosure of the reasons for the selection decision, (3) any
necessary argument from both parties, and (4) a judicial determination as to whether the reason
satisfies the rational relationship component of equal protection.  But see Armstrong, 116 S. Ct.
at 1480 (noting that a Batson claim differs from a selective prosecution claim because in former
context, the entire voir dire takes place before the judge to whom the equal protection challenge
is made and the prosecutor need answer only about decisions in that case); McCleskey v. Kemp,
481 U.S. 279, 297 n.17 (1987).
HeinOnline -- 70 S. Cal. L. Rev. 724 1996-19971997] FEDERALIZATION OF CRIMINAL LAW
charging decisions.  A judicial determination that a prosecutor has en-
gaged in patently improper conduct, such as bringing charges for ra-
cially discriminatory  reasons or in retaliation  for the exercise  of a
constitutional right, can impose a significant stigma.  Thus, the threat
that a court will erroneously make such a finding may deter prosecu-
tors from engaging in legitimate conduct.341  However, the possibility
of a court making an erroneous  adverse ruling when conducting the
far less  sensitive  and more  deferential rationality  inquiry  does not
pose the threat of a similar stigma.  Indeed, prosecutors, as well as
other litigants in an adversary system, routinely advance justifications
for their actions.
The fear-of-disclosure-of-enforcement-policy  rationale for reluc-
tance to allow judicial inquiry is similarly unpersuasive.42  Even  as-
suming  that in-court disclosure of that portion  of the prosecution's
classification  scheme that led to charges against the complaining of-
fender would reveal the government's overall enforcement policy and
would be disseminated to potential offenders,a43 methods exist to limit
341.  Cf. Patrick J. Guinee, Comment, The Trend Toward the Extension ofBatson to Gender-
Based Peremptory Challenges, 32 Duo. L. REv. 833, 845 (1994) (suggesting that application of
equal protection doctrine to bar racially and sexually discriminatory peremptory challenges has a
"chilling effect").
342.  Initially, one might conclude that forced disclosure of enforcement policy promotes
rather than undermines enforcement.  To the extent that criminal law is intended to deter pro-
hibited behavior, it is necessary to inform the public about what is criminal. Thus, it may seem
unwise to keep secret that conduct likely to result in prosecution.  However, when the govern-
ment lacks the resources to prosecute all known violations of the criminal law or engages in less
than complete prosecution for other reasons, disclosure of enforcement policy can be counter-
productive. Having decided to prosecute some but not all known offenders, the government
may hope to maximize deterrence by keeping secret its selection criteria.  Requiring prosecutors
to disclose the criteria may provide potential offenders with sufficient information to structure
their activities so that they can violate the law but avoid prosecution.  See Abrams, supra note
28, at 29. Federal prosecutors are loath to disclose their selection criteria for this reason. See,
e.g., Pizzi, supran ote 28, at 1343 n.88 (discussing the refusal of an Assistant United States Attor-
ney in the Southern District of Florida to disclose drug quantity guidelines for fear of enabling
smugglers to alter behavior to avoid federal prosecution).
343.  It is not always the case that in-court disclosure of the pertinent  portions of the
prosecutive charging classification scheme in a single case will reveal the government's enforce-
ment policy in its entirety.  Even if it does, it is by no means certain that an in-court statement of
the classification scheme will be disseminated outside of court and will thus undermine enforce-
ment policy. Those who are in court to hear the stated explanation or otherwise learn of it must
be able to grasp its significance and communicate it to other potential offenders accurately.
Only potential offenders who routinely keep abreast of judicial proceedings will be able to deter-
mine the contours of an overall enforcement policy as it is revealed on a piecemeal basis in court.
Such offenders may be able to ascertain the policy even without in-court disclosure. Habitual
and sophisticated criminals, or their attorneys, may be students of the patterns of arrests and
charging decisions, and they may be able to determine with some certainty what activity will lead
to prosecution and what will not. Furthermore, even disclosure and effective dissemination of
HeinOnline -- 70 S. Cal. L. Rev. 725 1996-1997SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA LAW REVIEW  [Vol. 70:643
disclosure.  In response to a showing by a prosecutor that public, in-
court disclosure of the basis for prosecution in a particular case may
jeopardize law enforcement  efforts, a court could issue a protective
order, allowing the  defense attorney alone to learn  of the relevant
classification scheme and preventing her from disseminating it.344  Al-
ternatively, courts could allow the prosecutor to make an ex parte, in
camera disclosure so that only the court would learn the nature of the
classification  that led to the  charging  decision."a  Although such  a
procedure would deny both the defendant and his attorney the ability
to argue that the stated classification was irrational, a judge could con-
duct that inquiry alone.46  Defendants may not embrace such a proce-
dure, but would most certainly prefer it to a judicial refusal to conduct
rationality inquiry because  of concerns about disclosure  of enforce-
ment policy.
Finally, the fear-of-disclosure  rationale is even less compelling in
the specific context of challenges to prosecution under duplicative fed-
eral statutes.  Even if judicial inquiry does result in dissemination of
the federal government's enforcement plan, knowledgeable offenders
will not be assured freedom from state prosecution for their criminal
conduct.  Thus, depending  on offenders'  perceptions  of the relative
costs of federal and state prosecution,  the threat of the latter might
still be sufficient to deter them despite their knowledge of the federal
enforcement policy.
b.  Judiciali ncompetence: Wayte identifies four factors that "are
not readily susceptible to the kind of analysis the courts are competent
to undertake":  "the strength of the  case, the prosecution's  general
enforcement policy may be of little assistance to some offenders because it may not be possible
to structure criminal activity to both avoid prosecution and still profit from the crime.  Finally,
disclosure of a charging classification scheme does not bind the prosecutor to a consistent course
of conduct in the future.  Indeed, if a prosecutor believes that as a result of disclosure offenders
have altered patterns of criminal activity as a means of avoiding prosecution, nothing prevents
her from changing that policy and prosecuting those who have structured their activity to avoid
being charged.
344.  Cf FED. R. Cium. P. 16(d)(1) (allowing protective orders restricting discovery).
345.  Cf. United States v. Sal Keung Wong, 886 F.2d 252,256 (9th Cir. 1989) (district court
allowed  in camera interview  of confidential  informant without  presence  of defendant  or
counsel).
346.  In cases in which there is a rationality claim rather than a contention that the govern-
ment has engaged in improper discrimination, it would be easier for the court to conduct review
without benefit of input from the defense.  In the former case, unlike the latter, there would be
no need for the court to sift through discovery or other evidence to support allegations of dis-
criminatory impact and intent. Instead, the court could simply assess the rationality of the classi-
fication scheme.
HeinOnline -- 70 S. Cal. L. Rev. 726 1996-19971997] FEDERALIZATION OF CRIMINAL LAW
deterrence  value, the Government's  general enforcement  priorities,
and the case's relationship to the Government's  overall enforcement
plan."317  Once again, these factors are not persuasive grounds for a
blanket refusal to forego rationality review of charging decisions.
Wayte's concern about judicial inability to evaluate the strength
of cases is compelling.  Prosecutors routinely make charging decisions
based  on the strength of evidence,  choosing to prosecute  some de-
fendants but not others who may appear to be similarly situated based
on assessments  of numerous factors including predictions  about the
probable  outcome  of a jury  trial,  willingness  or credibility  of  wit-
nesses, or likelihood of suppression of evidence-considerations  that
are  both  beyond  the  expertise  of  reviewing  courts  and  likely  ra-
tional.348  However, federal prosecutors enforcing duplicative federal
statutes routinely screen cases for reasons other than the strength of
the evidence. 49  These preliminary screening decisions, if principled,
are likely to be policy-based and are akin to the types of legislative
and administrative decisions that courts routinely subject to equal pro-
tection review.  There is no need for courts reviewing policy determi-
nations to venture into areas outside of their expertise, like evaluation
of evidence, or second-guess decisions uniquely within the expertise of
prosecutors.350
347.  Wayte v. United States, 470 U.S. 598, 607 (1985).
348.  Other considerations also preclude judicial review of prosecutors' strength-of-evidence
determinations.  In order to evaluate such a classification, a court would have to compare the
strength of the case in which a defendant has raised a selective prosecution claim with the
strength of potential cases that were not charged. That evaluation, which would necessarily oc-
cur before the trial in the case pending in the court and without trial in the uncharged compari-
son pool cases, would be fact-specific and possibly complex, resting on judgments about witness
credibility, jury reaction to witnesses or evidence, strength of potential defenses, and a myriad of
other factors. Such judgments are uniquely within the expertise of prosecutors.  Courts lack not
only the proficiency to make those judgments, particularly without having heard evidence  at
trial, but they also do not have access to sufficient information to evaluate them.
Even if a court were equipped to review investigative and prosecutive decisions regarding
the merits of individual cases, the disclosure necessary for a court to conduct that review would
require significant delay and thus would militate against review. See discussion supra notes 338-
40 and accompanying text. It would also require disclosure of the opinions and conclusions of
investigators and prosecutors about the strength of cases and the credibility of witnesses in both
charged and uncharged cases.  In short, it would require intrusive and detailed judicial assess-
ment of investigative and prosecutive decisions, requiring judges to act as both law enforcement
officials and prosecutors and raising separation of powers concerns. See discussion supra Part
IV.A.1.
349.  See supra notes 240-246 and accompanying text.
350.  For example, a court is as equipped to assess the rationality of a prosecutorial policy to
bring charges only in drug cases involving certain threshold quantities of drugs as it is to review
the rationality of a statute that requires increased penalties in cases involving those qualities.

Wayte also expresses apprehension  about judicial competence  to
review "the prosecution's general deterrence value, the Government's
general enforcement priorities, and the case's relationship to the Gov-
ernment's overall enforcement plan."351 Despite the distinction drawn
above  between judicial ability  to review  policy-based decisions  and
inability  to review  evidence-based  charging  decisions,  this  passage
suggests  that  in  the  context  of  charging  decisions,  courts  are  ill-
equipped to review both.  This concern, however, like other concerns
expressed in Wayte, is best understood in the context of claims that the
prosecution is motivated by an improper discriminatory purpose, not
those questioning the rationality of charging decisions.
In order to resolve  a claim  of discriminatory  charging,  a court
must consider circumstantial  evidence of bad intent, including proof
of an imperfect fit between the  selection of the  defendant  and  the
reason for the classification scheme.  The existence of a less discrimi-
natory means of achieving  the same  objective is circumstantial  evi-
dence  of discriminatory purpose.  In addition, it tends to undercut  a
finding that the means used to achieve the government's objective are
sufficiently narrowly tailored  to that objective to satisfy strict scru-
tiny.35  By considering such evidence, courts are necessarily second-
guessing policy decisions  that play a role in charging, hypothesizing
that there may be less discriminatory methods of achieving the same
result.
Examination  of the facts in Wayte clarifies  the Court's concern
and demonstrates  that it is inapplicable when courts assess  only the
rationality of charging decisions.  In Wayte, the defendant claimed that
the government had prosecuted him for violating the Selective Service
laws  only because  he was  a vocal opponent to draft registration.53
The district court found that "the inference is strong that the Govern-
ment could have located non-vocal non-registrants, but chose not to"
and ordered discovery.354  In doing so, the district court tacitly ques-
tioned the government's selection of vocal registrants to maximize de-
terrence  ("general  deterrence  value");  the  government's  decision
whether  it  would  expend  the  resources  necessary  to  take  action
against nonvocal violators as well ("general enforcement priorities");

and how the government planned to deal with the widespread Selec-
tive  Service  violations  generally  ("overall  enforcement  plan").  In
short, the district court exceeded its competence by implying that the
government  could and  should have  prosecuted  nonvocal  nonregis-
trants355  Mere rationality review does not require similar intrusive
inquiry into potential hidden motives, consideration of less intrusive
methods of achieving the desired result, or judicial second-guessing of
enforcement  policy.  In order to conduct rationality review, a court
need  only ascertain  the portion  of the  government's  classification
scheme that explains the challenged charging decision and determine
if the selection of the defendant for prosecution is both consistent with
that explanation 56 and rationally related to a legitimate objective of
federal law enforcement.  Rationality review does not allow a court to
impose its views of better or less discriminatory methods of achieving
the  stated governmental  objective  and  thus  does  not implicate  the
problems that Wayte identifies.57
355.  See id. at 612-13.
356.  Defendants could challenge a prosecutor's explanation by presenting evidence that the
prosecutor's reason for selecting the defendant also applies to at least some unselected offenders
in the comparison pool. Such a showing should serve to undermine a prosecutor's explanation
only if she knew that the comparison pool offenders shared the characteristic used to select the
defendant. Alternatively, a defendant could challenge the explanation by showing that the gov-
ernment had prosecuted offenders who did not satisfy the purported selection criteria.
357.  The Wade Court's conclusion that courts can review the rationality of prosecutors' re-
fusals to file sentencing reduction motions to reward defendants for their cooperation, see supra
notes 223-231 and accompanying text, further suggests that the concerns expressed in Wayte are
not meant to foreclose limited rationality review of charging decisions but rather reflect reluc-
tance to impose on prosecutors the discovery, evidentiary hearings, and intense scrutiny neces-
sary to resolve claims of improper discrimination.  If the Court is willing to allow judicial inquiry
into the rationality of decisions to move for substantial assistance departures, as Wade seems to
hold, there is no reason why it should be unwilling to do the same with respect to charging
decisions, especially those that are policy-based.  Review of a prosecutors' decision whether to
file a "substantial-assistance"  departure motion is no less costly or more intrusive than review of
a charging decision.  Nor are courts any more capable of conducting that review. Indeed, the
opposite may be true. A prosecutor's decision whether or not to move for a sentencing reduc-
tion to reward cooperation requires a detailed and fact-specific inquiry into matters such as the
defendant's role in the offense, the usefulness of information that he has given, his credibility
and candor, the completeness of his information, his culpability relative to that of the people
about whom he has provided information, and expectations of future cooperation-all of which
are matters within the province of the prosecutor.  See United States v. Smith, 953 F.2d 1060,
1065 (7th Cir. 1992), overruled on other grounds by Wade v. United States, 504 U.S. 181 (1992)
(listing the following questions as unreviewable for arbitrariness: "How valuable was the assist-
ance? How valuable was this investigation, compared with others that a prosecutor may seek to
encourage by doling out greater rewards for cooperation?").  But cf.C ynthia Kwei Yung Lee,

B.  EVIDENTIARY  OBSTACLES
Courts frustrate efforts to obtain judicial review of charging deci-
sions by imposing evidentiary hurdles that aggrieved offenders are un-
able  to  overcome.  Before  courts  will  conduct  review  or  order
requested discovery,358 a claimant must present some evidence of: (1)
discriminatory  impact  by  demonstrating  that  the  prosecutor  has
treated him differently than others who appear to be similarly situated
in all relevant respects;359 (2) prosecutorial awareness of the similarly
situated others;360  and (3)  discriminatory intent by showing that the
prosecutor has selected him for an impermissible reason.361
When an offender challenges a charging decision by a state prose-
cutor or a federal prosecutor enforcing a nonduplicative federal stat-
ute, all three hurdles are often insurmountable regardless of the merit
of the claim.  Except for rare crimes that offenders  commit publicly,
like violations of Sunday closing laws, most people engaged in crimi-
nal conduct attempt to avoid detection.  Thus, proof of the existence
of a pool of similarly situated offenders who escaped prosecution will
be nearly impossible  unless  a  defendant  conducts  some sort of in-
dependent criminal investigation. 62  Even if a defendant were able to
identify such a pool of offenders, it is unlikely that he will be able to
prove that the prosecutor was aware of them, preventing the defend-
ant from satisfying the knowledge requirement.  Finally, even if the
prosecutor has consciously selected the defendant for an impermissi-
ble reason, she almost certainly will have avoided generating any tan-
gible evidence  of that intent.363  In the event some evidence of bad
intent exists, the prosecutor will have exclusive possession of it.36  Be-
cause a defendant must present some evidence of both discriminatory
than prosecutors to determine whether a departure is warranted).  Indeed, such review could
jeopardize on-going investigations or require comparisons between the defendant and others
who  had  provided  information,  potentially  jeopardizing  the  anonymity  and  safety  of
cooperators.

359.  See, eg., Wayte, 470 U.S. at 608-09; Ah Sin v. Wittman, 198 U.S. 500, 507-08 (1905).

363.  In addition, the prosecutor's  decisionmaking may be influenced by unconscious mo-
tives. See, e.g., Developments, supra note 205, at 1523-25 (discussing unconscious racism which
will not generate any tangible evidence).

impact and discriminatory intent to compel discovery,365 he will rarely
be able to gain access to that evidence.
In contrast, when an  offender selected for prosecution under a
duplicative federal statute questions the rationality of the selection de-
cision, he has a better chance of surmounting the first two evidentiary
obstacles and the possibility of persuading a court to lower the third.
It is far easier to identify offenders who have been charged in state
court than those who have escaped prosecution altogether.66  Like-
wise, because the similarly situated offenders have been identified and
charged in state court, c6mplainants can make a stronger showing that
federal prosecutors are aware of their existence. 67
Finally, courts should not require offenders who only question the
rationality of a charging decision to shoulder the burden of presenting
evidence of the prosecutor's intent.  Although courts confronted with
claims of improper discriminatory purpose require defendants, rather
than  the prosecution,  to come forward  with some  evidence  of the
prosecutor's  reasons for selecting  them, the same  allocation  of the
burden when entertaining rationality claims makes little sense.363  Un-
like an improper discriminatory motive claimant, a rationality claim-
ant does not profess to know why the prosecution has selected him.
He will have no particularized suspicions to inform efforts to discover
the nature of the classification scheme.369  He is as likely to be able to
365.  See supra note 272.
366.  A defendant would first determine whether the federal statute he is charged under
duplicates some state criminal statute. If so, he could determine, by polling the local defense
bar, or by obtaining-either through voluntary compliance, subpoena, or other court order-
files or data compilations from state prosecutors or courts to show the existence of a pool of
people who the state prosecuted for the same conduct that led to his federal charges. The Ann-
strong Court concluded that such a task is "not ...  insuperable."  United States v. Armstrong,
116 S. Ct. 1480, 1489 (1996).
367.  For a fuller discussion of this topic, see supra 287-91 and accompanying text.
368.  Some have argued that it also makes little sense to require improper discriminatory
motive claimants to present evidence of the prosecutor's intent because the prosecutor will al-
most always have exclusive access to that information. See, eg., Applegate, supra note 28, at 86-
87; Developments, supra note 205, at 1549. Despite the force of those contentions, the require-
ment is firmly entrenched in cases in which defendants allege their prosecutions are based on
improper discriminatory motives.  See, eg., Wayte v. United States, 470 U.S. 598, 608 (1985)
(requiring that defendant "show both that the passive enforcement system had a discriminatory
effect and that it was motivated by a discriminatory purpose").
369.  In contrast, a defendant who alleges an improper motive is likely to have at least some
circumstantial evidence to support his claim-whatever evidence initially raised his suspicions
about the prosecutor's motives.  Even if the defendant's evidence is insufficient to prevail, it will
provide some guidance as to how to develop his claim further.  See Bubany & Skillem, supra
note 28, at 503-04 ("Absent a suspect criterion such as race, religion, or cultural background, it is
unlikely that the defendant will be able to prove arbitrary action.").

determine why he has been chosen for federal prosecution when simi-
larly situated others have not as he would be able to determine why he
was struck by lightning during a thunderstorm when others standing
nearby were not. Thus, when confronted with evidence of a compari-
son pool of disparately treated offenders and prosecutorial awareness
of that pool, there is good reason for courts to require that federal
prosecutors  disclose the classification scheme that resulted in the de-
fendant's selection.370
370.  Requiring federal prosecutors to explain selection of defendants for prosecution under
these circumstances is consistent with the procedure the Court has mandated for litigating equal
protection objections to peremptory challenges in Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U.S. 79 (1986), and its
progeny.  See, eg., J.E.B. v. Alabama, 114 S. Ct. 1419 (1994) (holding that Batson precludes
gender as well as race discrimination in exercise of peremptory challenges); Georgia v. McCol-
lum, 505 U.S. 42 (1992) (Batson applies to defendants' peremptory challenges); Powers v. Ohio,
499 U.S. 400 (1991)  (Batson applies even when juror and defendant are different races; safe-
guards jurors' rights); Hernandez v. New York, 500 U.S. 352 (1991)  (describing application of
test). Those cases hold that once a defendant presents prima facie evidence that a prosecutor has
exercised a peremptory challenge in a racially or sexually discriminatory manner, the trial court
must compel the prosecutor to give a race- or gender-neutral explanation for the challenge.  The
trial court then determines whether the explanation is satisfactory.  See, eg., Hernandez, 500
U.S. at 358-59.  The Batson analogy is compelling because the degree of judicial intrusion is
similar to that proposed here-in both cases, the court requires only an oral explanation justify-
ing the exercise of prosecutorial decision, not discovery or an evidentiary hearing, and resolves
the issue at that time, without unduly delaying the proceedings. If equal protection requires that
a prosecutor faced with prima facie evidence of discrimination explain the reasons for a peremp-
tory challenge in order to avoid denying a potential juror the "opportunity to participate in civic
life," Powers, 499 U.S. at 409, it surely should require as much for a federally-prosecuted defend-
ant who can demonstrate that he is subject to harsher treatment in federal court when others are
not.  Although the Batson procedures have been criticized for threatening to turn the "side-
show" of jury selection into "part of the main event," J.E.B., 114 S. Ct. at 1431 (O'Connor, J.,
concurring), a federal prosecutor's charging decision, which plays a significant role in determin-
ing the defendant's constitutional and procedural protections and the length of the sentence he
may receive and serve if convicted, clearly is the main event. See supra notes 178-80 and accom-
panying text.  Thus, upon a showing of prejudicial disparate impact, there is greater reason to
require a prosecutor to explain her charging decision despite any minimal delay or intrusiveness
than there is to compel explanation of the exercise of peremptory challenges.
To be sure, there are significant differences between the Batson context and this one. See
Armstrong, 116 S. Ct. at 1480 (describing some differences between Batson and selective prose-
cution claims).  For example, under Batson, a prima facie showing of discriminatory motive, not
merely prejudicial disparate impact, is necessary to trigger both the prosecutor's duty to explain
and judicial review. However, as Wade makes clear, allegations and proof of improper discrimi-
nation are not the sine qua non of judicial review of prosecutorial decisions. See supra notes 223-
29 and accompanying text.  Unlike charging decisions, peremptory challenges need not be ra-
tional.  See Purkett v. Elem, 115 S. Ct. 1769, 1771 (1995).  Thus, the Batson procedures applica-
tion only to cases of improper discrimination stems from the broad discretion associated with
peremptory  challenges,  rather  than  from  any  general  limitation  on  judicial  review  of
prosecutorial decisionmaking.

Recognition of a judicially enforceable right to rationality review
would provide a defendant subjected to differential treatment as a re-
sult  of  a federal  charging  decision  with  two nonexclusive  options.
First, he  could  contest  the rationality  of  the charging  decision  by
showing disparate impact and prosecutorial awareness of similarly sit-
uated others.  Such a showing would compel a prosecutor to explain
the charging  decision.371  Second, if the defendant  believes that the
real reason for prosecution is race, excercise of a constitutional right,
or some other forbidden characteristic, he can seek discovery and an
evidentiary hearing to establish that allegation.  However, under pre-
vailing law, he must present some proof of improper motive before a
court will order discovery and conduct review.
C.  Tim DEFERENTIAL NATURE OF RATIONALITY  REVIEW
Arguably,  recognition  and  enforcement  of  a  right  to  rational
charging classifications  will do no more than enable federally prose-
cuted defendants to jump from the frying pan into the fire;  that is,
they escape excessive judicial deference to charging decisions only to
confront solicitous rationality  review.372  As  long as  the prosecutor
had some rational method-severity of the crimes committed, a con-
nection to interstate commerce, the investigative agency involved, or
the offender's criminal record-for distinguishing offenders who were
selected from those who were not, charging decisions would withstand
equal protection review.  It would be unusual for a court to determine
that a federal prosecutor's charging decision does not satisfy the def-
erential  rationality  standard.  Federal courts'  refusal  to conduct  ra-
tionality review at all may be due in part to their recognition that such
oversight would be a futile gesture and thus unworthy of the costs,
however minimal, review may impose.
Even if rationality review is of doubtful efficacy as a remedy for
aggrieved  defendants,  judicial  enforcement  of  a  right  to  rational
371.  If public disclosure would harm the government's enforcement efforts, the court should
either limit disclosure to the defense attorney alone with a protective order preventing dissemi-
nation, or, alternatively, allow for in camera, ex parte disclosure only. See supra notes 344-46 and
accompanying text.
372.  One commentator opined that:
[g]enerally speaking, judicial refusal to review the prosecutor's charging decision except
in cases of invidious or bad faith discrimination appears to be inevitable, or at least of
no consequence.  As in the case of judicial review of legislation, review of the charging
decision would yield the conclusion that the decision regarding prosecution is in most
instances rationally related to a legitimate law enforcement goal.
Gifford, supra note 28, at 704.
HeinOnline -- 70 S. Cal. L. Rev. 733 1996-1997SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA LAW REVIEW  [Vol. 70:643
charging classifications could have a salutary effect on the administra-
tion of justice in federal courts. First, it would give unequivocal notice
to federal prosecutors that they have a constitutional obligation to ra-
tionally  differentiate  between  those  offenders  subjected  to harsher
treatment in federal court and those who could be but are not. Under
existing law, federal prosecutors may conclude that as long as they are
not motivated by an improper discriminatory purpose, they are free to
select offenders for federal prosecution for any reason or no reason at
all.  Certainly decisions that deny the existence of a right to rational
charging classifications  altogether373 support  that conclusion.  Cases
that preclude rationality review without affirmatively recognizing the
existence of such a right374 are similarly flawed. Busy federal prosecu-
tors may overlook the  subtle difference  between judicial  refusal to
recognize  a right and judicial  refusal to enforce  a right. There  is  a
danger that at least  some federal prosecutors  haphazardly  select  a
portion of those to be charged in federal court.  If we expect federal
prosecutors, like other governmental actors, to have rational reasons
for treating  similarly situated  people  differently,  it makes  sense to
clearly state that equal protection imposes such a norm. Current doc-
trine teaches the opposite lesson.
Second, the threat of judicial inquiry and a requirement that fed-
eral prosecutors  explain charging decisions when defendants make a
sufficient threshold  showing would  encourage them to develop  and
adhere  to  rational  classification  schemes  for  selecting  eligible
offenders.375
373.  See cases cited supra note 207.
374.  See supra note 208.
375.  See Bubany & Skillem, supra note 28, at 505 (judicial review "assists the prosecutor in
developing impartial policies influenced only by matters pertinent to maintaining a just system");
Givelber, supra note 28, at 112 ("the process of analyzing why the law has been selectively en-
forced should lead the prosecutor to make more thoughtful enforcement decisions").
To say that the Constitution requires federal prosecutors to have a rational classification
scheme does not suggest that the scheme would be judicially enforceable-that is, that depar-
tures from the scheme would provide a defendant with a claim for relief. Prosecutors could
justify departures from the scheme as long as the departures were rational.  Requiring only that
charging decisions be rational gives prosecutors considerably more flexibility than an approach
that allows court to force them to comply with a set of predetermined prosecutive guidelines.
For a discussion of judicial enforcement of prosecutive guidelines, see Beale, supra note 2, at
1017-18 n.143.
HeinOnline -- 70 S. Cal. L. Rev. 734 1996-19971997] FEDERALIZATION OF CRIMINAL LAW
Third, forcing  prosecutors  to  have  good  reasons for  selection
would have a prophylactic  effect, decreasing the possibility that im-
proper  discriminatory  motives will play  some  conscious  or uncon-
scious role in a federal prosecutor's  charging decisions. 76
In addition to prompting federal prosecutors to employ rational
selection schemes, enforcement of a right to rational charging classifi-
cations may result in a beneficial modification of current defense prac-
tice.  In the  context  of duplicative  federal prosecutions,  prevailing
selective prosecution  doctrine prompts  defendants to focus their ef-
forts on a problem that rarely exists-racially discriminatory selection
of offenders-and offers a remedy that is stringent in theory but illu-
sory in practice.  At the same time, it draws attention away from the
injustice  of  dramatic  disparities in treatment  without good  reason.
While defendants engage in wasted efforts to satisfy impossible bur-
dens  of proving intentional  racial discrimination  that probably does
not exist,377 there is nothing to prevent the arbitrary imposition of har-
sher treatment  on those unlucky enough to be selected for federal
prosecution.  By limiting review to those defendants who allege racial
discrimination  or other improper motives, existing doctrine also pro-
motes frivolous claims.  Even if a defendant does not believe that dis-
criminatory  motives  prompted  prosecution,  he  must  make  those
allegations  if he is to have any chance of relief from disparate treat-
ment resulting from federal prosecution.378  These claims waste judi-
cial and prosecutorial resources,  unfairly subject federal prosecutors
376.  "Giving prosecutors the power to invoke or deny punishment at their discretion raises
the prospect that society's most fundamental sanctions will be imposed arbitrarily and capri-
ciously and that the least favored members of the community-racial  and ethnic minorities, so-
cial outcasts, the poor-will be treated most harshly."  Vorenberg, supra note 28, at 1555. See
generally Frederick Schauer, Giving Reasons, 47 Sm. L. REv. 633, 657 (1995) (When there are
grounds for believing that decisions may be the "product of bias, self-interest, insufficient reflec-
tion, or simply excess haste, requiring decision makers to give reasons may counteract some of
those tendencies.").
377.  Notably, the Chief Judge of the Central District of California, the federal district that
spawned claims of discriminatory charging practices in crack cocaine cases, determined that
there was "no evidence that prosecutive decisions by the United States Attorney's Office for the
Central District of California are made on the basis of race." Dan Weikel, Judge Finds No Bias
in Crack Prosecutions,L .A. TmEs,  Apr. 2, 1996, at Al.  This decision was made despite the fact
that the United States Attorney's Office had never prosecuted a white defendant under the
draconian federal cocaine base laws and had almost exclusively prosecuted black defendants.
See United States v. Armstrong, 116 S. Ct. 1480, 1495 n.6 (1996) (Stevens, J., dissenting).

eral court] happening."  David G. Savage, "Selective Prosecution" Case to Be Heard by High
Court, L.A. TimEs, Oct. 31, 1995, at A4. Rather than accuse the prosecutor of intentional racial

to meritless and damaging accusations,379 and reduce the chances that
courts will give serious consideration to the rare meritorious claim.  If,
instead,  defendants  who  were  able to  make  a  sufficient  threshold
showing  could require  a prosecutor  to explain  the reasons  for her
charging  decisions, it might decrease  the number of unsubstantiated
claims of racially discriminatory selection.
Enforcement of the right may also ease some of the pressure that
federalization imposes on federal dockets.  Aware that they will not
be able to selectively subject offenders to harsher treatment without a
reason for doing so, federal prosecutors may be less inclined to prose-
cute the cases that many courts and commentators believe do not "be-
long"  in  federal  court-those  that  are  indistinguishable  from  the
multitude  of  street-corner  drug  sales,  weapons  offenses,  robberies,
residential arsons, and petty frauds that are prosecuted daily in state

courts.
D.  RELUCTANCE TO DisMiss  CHARGES AS  A REMEDY
Finally, federal courts' refusal to review  charging decisions may
reflect an aversion to dismissing charges against offenders simply be-
cause similarly situated others have not been prosecuted.  Courts have
assumed that the remedy for selective prosecution is dismissal;38 yet

the  Supreme  Court  recently  stated  that  it has  "never  determined
whether  dismissal  of the indictment,  or some  other sanction, is the
proper remedy" for selective prosecution.3a  If a less draconian rem-
edy was available,  courts might be more willing  to review  charging
decisions.

tor's office  and avoid the aura of suspicion that attaches to unpublished, secret  practices."

380.  Several observers believe that the availability of longer sentences has prompted federal
prosecutors to bring charges in many cases where there are overlapping state and federal crimes.
See, eg., Beale, supra note 2, at 1004 (stating that "sentencing is probably the most important
factor that motivates prosecutors to bring federal charges when there is dual jurisdiction"); Lit-
tle, supra note 5, at 1079 & n.240. A requirement that federal prosecutors have an independent

FEDERALIZATION OF CRIMINAL LAW
Arguably,  an aggrieved defendant  is  only entitled to the same
treatment received by the similarly situated offenders whom he identi-
fies to demonstrate disparate treatment.  If a federally prosecuted de-
fendant establishes an equal protection violation by identifying a pool
of offenders who are prosecuted in state court, instead of dismissing
the case, the court could attempt to afford the defendant the benefit
of the state doctrines he would otherwise be denied.83  For example,
if state law  contains  no presumptions  requiring  pretrial  detention,
equal protection could preclude a federal court from relying on feder-
ally imposed presumptions to detain a defendant.  If state law grants
discovery rights to a defendant that are not guaranteed by federal stat-
utes  or rules, equal protection could require that the defendant be
afforded equivalent rights. 31  If state constitutional law requires sup-
pression of evidence but federal law does not, the federal court could
order suppresion, finding that admission of the evidence would violate
the  defendant's  equal  protection  rights.  Similarly,  a  federal  court
could find that application  of harsh federal sentencing guidelines  or
mandatory minimum provisions of federal sentencing statutes violates
equal protection if similarly situated offenders in state court were not
subject to similarly harsh sentences.  Unfettered by those restraints on
sentencing discretion,  a federal  court would be free  to sentence  an
offender within the statutory maximum sentence in a manner consis-
tent with sentences received and served by offenders  prosecuted in
state court.385
383.  Not only is such a remedy less draconian than dismissal, it ensures that a defendant will
not "slip through the cracks" and avoid state prosecution because of a federal prosecutor's fail-
ure to refer the case to the state after a dismissal.  Cf. Frase, supra note 170, at 277-80 (noting
that numerous defendants whose cases federal prosecutors decline because of the availability of
state prosecution are never charged in state court).
384.  In Armstrong, the Court held that there is no statutory right to discovery to pursue a
selective prosecution claim. See Armstrong, 116 S. Ct. at 1485. Instead, the Court assumed that
upon a sufficient showing by the defendant, equal protection principles compel discovery to
determine whether there has been an equal protection violation, see id. at 1485-86, an assump-
tion that lower courts have accepted without question. If equal protection can require discovery
to determine whether there has been a constitutional violation absent a statutory mandate, cer-
tainly it can compel discovery to remedy a violation.
385.  In other contexts, federal courts approximate how much time a defendant will actually
serve if he receives a particular sentence in state court. See, ag., United States v. Yates, 58 F.3d
542 (10th Cir. 1995) (when determining "reasonable incremental punishment" under § 5G1.3(c)
of the federal sentencing guidelines, for purposes of deciding whether to have federal sentence
run  concurrent, consecutive, or partially consecutive  to undischarged state sentence, courts
should approximate "real or effective" state sentence, not the sentence actually imposed).  At-
tempts to equalize treatment will necessarily be imperfect in many cases.

Such oversight and remedial  action would not unduly constrain
federal prosecutors.  It would merely subject them to the same con-
straints that control other government actors-the equal protection
guarantees  believed to be essential in contexts in which far less than
lengthy prison sentences are at stake.  Because the remedy for violat-
ing an offender's equal protection rights would consist of an effort to
approximate the treatment similarly situated offenders receive in state
court, judicial enforcement  of the rationality requirement  would, in
essence,  leave  federal  prosecutors'  charging  discretion  untouched.
They would not be denied the opportunity to prosecute defendants,
only the ability to subject them to harsher treatment in cases in which
they lack a rational basis for bringing  the federal prosecution.  The
availability of appellate review of district court rationality determina-
tions could further ameliorate prosecutors' concerns.386  It would pro-
vide  them  with  a  forum  in  which  they  could  contest  adverse
determinations, and it would allow for the development of a common
law of proper reasons for selection for federal prosecution. This prece-
dent would then provide guidance and be binding on lower courts.
The possibility of judicial review  of charging decisions  leaves a
number of questions for courts to resolve.  For example, how much of
a difference between federal and state procedures is sufficient to war-
rant equal protection review? 7  How many similarly situated offend-
ers are necessary to trigger equal protection concerns?388  How similar
must offenders be to be "similarly  situated? '389  How should courts
treat case-specific doctrinal differences between federal and state law,
such as the application of an evidentiary rule that does not necessarily
prejudice defendants but may operate to a defendant's disadvantage
under the facts of a particular case?  By requiring its prosecutors to
develop and apply rational classification schemes, the Department of
386.  Courts could require that defense efforts to have state doctrines imposed during trial be
raised pretrial to enable prosecutors to appeal adverse decisions.  Cf.F ED. R. CwM.  P. 12(f)

utory appeals of pretrial rulings).

situated "when their circumstances present no distinguishable legitimate prosecutorial  factors
that might justify making different prosecutorial decisions with respect to them"). See also Pizzi,
supra note 28, at 1369 (stating that "it is easy to agree that similar offenders should be treated
similarly, but deciding which offenders are 'similar' turns out to be much harder than we thought
it would be").

Justice could make judicial resolution of these questions unnecessary.
However, if judicial involvement is ultimately needed, these questions
and others  should not preclude  defendants  who are unequally bur-
dened by federal prosecution from receiving the same equal protec-
tion  guarantees  as  others  on  the  losing  end  of  government
classifications.
CONCLUSION
The federalization  of substantive criminal law and the disparity
between treatment received in federal and state criminal justice sys-
tems have created what Professor Sara Sun Beale aptly characterizes
as a "cruel lottery, '390 in which some unfortunate offenders are sub-
ject to dramatically harsher treatment than similarly situated others.
Equal protection, which requires  that government  actors have a ra-
tional basis for imposing differential treatment-even in contexts in
which there is far less at stake than in the criminal justice system-
should impose the same obligation on prosecutors.  It compels federal
prosecutors, whose  selection decisions  can mean  the difference  be-
tween pretrial release  and detention, dismissal  and conviction,  or a
slap on the wrist and a lengthy prison term, to use principled methods
of  determining  which  eligible  offenders  will  be  subject to  federal
rather than state prosecution.  To ensure rational charging decisions,
the Department  of Justice  should amend  its "Principles  of Federal
Prosecution" to require  that federal prosecutors not only avoid bad
reasons for making charging  decisions, but that they have good ones
for  treating  federally  prosecuted  offenders  differently  than  those
charged in state court.
If faced with evidence that arbitrary selection is routine and un-
checked by administrative policy, courts should reconsider their reluc-
tance  to  review  charging  decisions  absent  proof  of  improper
discrimination.  Considerations that counsel judicial restraint are not
convincing barriers to limited judicial oversight of the rationality of
federal prosecutors'  decisions to bring charges under duplicative fed-
eral statutes.  Although such review would rarely result in a finding of
an equal protection violation and the need to grant a remedy, it would
prompt federal prosecutors to make principled selection decisions.
