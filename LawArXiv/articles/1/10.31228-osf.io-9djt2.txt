Introduction
  In June 2003, a United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea
(UNCLOS) tribunal, constituted under the auspices of the Permanent
Court of Arbitration, rendered a procedural order that has since entered
the number of international decisions to be studied in a modern interna-
tional law course.1 This was not the only decision in the broader dispute
between Ireland and the United Kingdom concerning the operation of the
nuclear reprocessing plant in Sellafield (in fact, the dispute yielded a grand
total of six); nor was it the one that settled it.2 Rather, its importance lies
in the way the tribunal—one of illustrious composition—decided to man-
age a potential conflict with other international jurisdictions. Faced with
the prospect of an almost certain involvement of the European Court of
Justice, the tribunal opted to suspend its proceedings.3
  Let us keep the tape rolling as we fast-forward a decade. In 2013, an
International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) arbitral
tribunal observed that, while the tribunal was not bound in principle by
any rule of precedent, “it should have regard to earlier decisions of courts
(particularly the International Court of Justice (ICJ)) and of other interna-
tional dispute tribunals engaged in the interpretation of the terms of a
[Bilateral Investment Treaty].”4 And the next year, another example: faced
with the problem of parallel proceedings on the same dispute pending
before the domestic courts of the respondent state, an investment tribunal
observed that it had “a measure of discretion with respect to the timing and
conduct of the arbitration and that municipal judicial proceedings may
sometimes need to be taken into account.”5
  What the cases (and the list could be extended quite at length) have in
common is not the originating regime, the factual matrix at issue, or the
legal problem in question, but rather the reliance on a specific, if mul-
tifaceted, principle: comity. Most legal systems look at the word with some
suspicion because there seems to be no end to the debate on its meaning.6
In the field of international law, the problem is even greater, as to talk of a
principle of “comity” is to talk of a principle that does not satisfy the legal-
ity threshold.7 Yet, this is a concept that can lay claim to a long history,
and stubbornly refuses to go away: with some generalizations, the tradi-
tional definition of comity may be that of a principle in the name of which
courts would fine-tune the reach of their national substantive law and juris-
dictional rules, refrain from questioning the lawfulness of another sover-

eign state’s acts, and restrict themselves from issuing such judgments and
orders when to do so would amount to an unjustifiable interference.
Whatever one thinks of it, comity is widely referred to in the case law of
domestic courts.8 And of more immediate relevance for our purposes,
there are indications that it may be resurfacing in the context of interna-
tional adjudication.9 While it was never really a stranger in their cham-
bers, its recent rediscovery by international courts and tribunals can be
better explained against the background of the proliferation of judicial and
arbitral institutions and the interactions deriving therefrom.
  International law, to go along with an oft-cited decision, “lacks a central-
ised structure,” and “does not provide for an integrated judicial system
operating an orderly division of labour among a number of tribunals.”10
Given the number and diversity of international judicial bodies, it is hardly
surprising that those who adopted expressions such as “the international
judiciary” only did so at the price of far-reaching caveats or inverted com-
mas.11 Jurisdictional competition need not necessarily be considered dis-
advantageous, but it inevitably brings to the table the possibility of parallel
proceedings, diverging interpretations of the same rule, instances of forum
shopping, as well as the risk of conflicting decisions.12 Conflicts of legal
regimes probably cannot be dealt with in a fashion that is entirely satisfac-
tory with the currently available rules. Doubts in fact remain as to whether
any rules at all could succeed in the task. For this reason, comity, which is
a creature subtler than rules, may well appear as a readily available cure for
some of these systemic problems.13
  The question we want to address, then, is this: what exactly is the place of
comity in modern public international law adjudication? To do so, the
present study moves in three parts: Part I deals with the concept of comity
in private and public international law, briefly considering its develop-
ment and its modern understanding. In Part II, we shift our focus to inter-
national dispute settlement and seek to identify the problems for which the
use of comity has been proposed and we engage with the current scholarly
debate on the matter. In Part III we discuss all the publicly available deci-
sions by international courts and tribunals using the term comity and clas-

sify them before finally pulling the threads together.14
I. The Concept of Comity
A celebrated international law textbook quipped that comity is “a won-
derful word to use when one wants to blur the distinction between public
and private international law, or to avoid clarity of thought.”15 There are
two pieces of conventional wisdom here. The first is that, indeed, private
and public international lawyers, with some remarkable exceptions, seem
to agree that the concept of comity is not to be understood as terribly help-
ful. We will try, throughout this Article, to show that the helpfulness of
comity may well depend on how well we understand it. The second is that
private and public international law understandings of comity need to be
distinguished. In attempts to investigate what comity means, it is indeed
problematic to dispense with this distinction. It leads us, for instance, to
try to find a common denominator for comity in private and in public
international law. This common denominator, according to Cheatham, is
the idea that “the relation or the action in question is governed by consider-
ations other than compulsion or legal duty.”16 Not much understanding is
gained this way. Along the same line of thought, if we focus on the etymo-
logical origins of the word, we end up in a similar place. Consider: the
word comity derives from the Latin noun comitas, meaning “courtesy,”
“friendliness,” and “civility,” but also “humanity.”17 In the English lan-
guage, the term indicates courtesy and considerate behaviour towards
others,18 or “a loose widespread community based on common social
institutions.”19
  In this Part, then, we will examine what comity means in public and in
private international law separately. This does mean, however, that the
concept in one field cannot be conveniently used in the other, as we will
argue throughout this Article. Before we do this, however, we should recall
that it is not too hard to find cases where comity was employed as short-
14. This covers all decisions issued by dispute settlement mechanisms in disputes
with at least one state party where there is some discussion of what comity is. Accord-
ingly, we have included cases where mentions of the principle were meaningful, albeit
brief, and excluded decisions which, while containing the word “comity, clearly and
unambiguously addressed entirely different issues. Consideration was also given to the
issue of “false positives”: this is the case, for example, of expressions such as “the comity
of the majority” and citations of excerpts from other judgments lacking further discus-
sion, but also of decisions referring to unrelated concepts such as “positive comity.” See

Competition Laws, June 3–4, 1998, U.S.-E.C., art. III.

hand for public international law or the entire field of conflict of law. But
it is for a more specific meaning that we are looking.
A. Comity and Public International Law
  In traditional public international law scholarship, the term comity tradi-
tionally designates, first and foremost, those acts performed—by states and
towards states only—for reasons other than the belief that there is a bind-
ing legal norm mandating them.20 Accordingly, it is customary to focus on
them to explain what international law is not.21
The non-bindingness of the rules of international comity is clearly not
disputed, but to conclude that they have no normative value whatsoever
would be a non sequitur.22 Bindingness and normativity are two different
things.23 As Hedley Bull pointed out, “order in social life is very closely
connected with the conformity of human behaviour to [normative] rules of
conduct, if not necessarily to [binding] rules of law.”24 This is surely the
case of rules of comity, which too arise from repetition of conduct—con-
duct which, however, is carried out in the belief that is not mandated by a
rule of international law.25 In the real world, rules of comity are routinely
complied with.26 This may result, as Hersch Lauterpacht put it, in a rule of
comity “acquiring the complexion” of rules of customary international
law.27 In other words, comity is not a source of international law, but it
may be, and has been, the basis and justification for the emergence of rules
of international law.28 Questions of immunity, for instance, largely fall
into this category.29 Where comity constitutes the basis of a rule of inter-

national law, the question may arise of what significance, if any, this origin
should have. In any event, while it has been argued that reading a rule of
international law with comity in mind could, for example, “determine what
is required by good faith, which takes into account reliability based on
tradition and expectations of courtesy.”30 Reliance on the principle is, in
any event, limited to elucidating the meaning and purpose of the rule
itself.31
B. Comity in Private International Law
1. Background
The history of the notion of comity in private international law is very
much a history of the concept of sovereignty.32 With the development of
the Westphalian system, territorial sovereignty and freedom from interfer-
ence were consecrated as the essential pillars of the new world order, and a
system of territorial law replaced the old personal statutes.33 Still, the
transnational commercial relations that flourished on the European conti-
nent were not ready for such rigidity.34 Accordingly, comity was developed
as a doctrine intended to mitigate the ill-effects of strict territoriality.35
The doctrine was developed in the Netherlands by scholars seeking to
answer the specific problem of which law should govern a specific legal
relationship.36 In its most celebrated formulation, by Ulrich Huber, the
doctrine provided an elegant solution based on three axioms, the first two
reaffirming the principle of territorial sovereignty, and the third postulat-

Rule, Comity or Something Else?, 21 EUR. J. INT. LAW 853, 870–71 (2010). It must be
pointed out that there exist, in this area, references to comity that blur the distinction.
According to Collins, for example, “[i]t is no doubt in the sense of binding rules of
public international law that the expression is used” with reference to immunity. Lau-

(“The Court must first examine whether the limitation pursued a legitimate aim. In this
connection, it observes that State immunity was developed in international law out of
the principle par in parem non habet imperium, by virtue of which one State could not be
subject to the jurisdiction of another. The Court considers that the grant of immunity to
a State in civil proceedings pursues the legitimate aim of complying with international
law to promote comity and good relations between States through the respect of another
State’s sovereignty.”). The matter will be further investigated infra Part III.

ing that state authorities could have applied foreign laws to govern private
interactions, “so far as they do not cause prejudice to the power or rights”
of the state concerned.37
There is no genuine consensus as to the issue of whether the third
axiom was meant to grant absolute discretion to the national authorities of
one nation or was, on the contrary, a simple description of the current
practices.38 Huber’s understanding of international law was fundamen-
tally Grotian, and it is not inconceivable that his intention might have been
to qualify the rule as an international usage—if not as a custom proper.39
It was comity’s discretionary component, however, that had the most sig-
nificant impact, especially in the common law world.40 Lord Mansfield in
England and Joseph Story in the United States realized the significance of
the concept, and the latter in particular granted widespread recognition to
Huber’s views—though, according to some, he did so at the cost of some
inaccuracies.41 A United States Supreme Court Justice, Story did not see
comity as amounting to anything more than a rather imperfect obligation,
arising “from mutual interest and utility, from a sense of the inconve-
niences which would result from a contrary doctrine.”42 The Supreme
Court later produced what still is the most influential statement of the
doctrine. In Hilton v Guyot, a decision of immeasurable influence, Justice
Gray defined comity as “neither a matter of absolute obligation, on the one
hand, nor of mere courtesy and goodwill, upon the other.”43 Comity was
in fact, Justice Gray continued, “the recognition which one nation allows
within its territory to the legislative, executive, or judicial acts of another
nation, having due regard both to international duty and convenience and
to the rights of its own citizens or of other under the protection of its
laws.”44
2. Current Uses of Comity
With the unfolding of the positivist revolution, comity ceased to be
considered a suitable basis for private international law.45 Yet, as Law-
rence Collins noted in 2002, the use of the term by the judiciary remains

extensive, regardless how much it is frowned upon in textbooks.46 In its
modern incarnation, the “doctrine of comity” requires courts to place trust
in and not interfere with foreign courts, as well as to give “full faith and
credit to, or [respect] the conclusiveness of, the acts of foreign institutions”;
at the same time, it provides the principles that should guide these prac-
tices.47 With some approximation, the uses of comity may be classified
according to a taxonomy proposed by Harold Koh, which distinguishes
between legislative (or prescriptive) comity, judicial comity, and executive
comity.48 The first two concern the application of foreign law or the limi-
tation of the reach of local law, as well as the recognition of foreign deci-
sions or the use of discretion to limit the jurisdiction of domestic courts.49
The third, instead, commands deference when foreign sovereign interests
are at stake and provides a basis for the “act of state doctrine”—which bars
a court from sitting in judgment of the acts that another sovereign state
performs in its territory—and does not necessarily fit well with the other
two categories.50 All these uses reflect, as Donald Childress puts it, “a set
of ideas about sovereign-sovereign relations that courts can point to and
take into account when adjudicating transnational disputes.”51 In the day-
to-day administration of justice, comity tends, however, to be a simpler
matter, and operates as a judicial tool in such a way that, in Adrian Briggs’s
words, “the language of the comity of sovereigns . . . feels out of place.”52
In practice, comity has been invoked as an upper limit to restrain the reach
of domestic law in cases concerning issues as diverse as competition and
human rights. It has been considered a relevant factor in the granting of
recognition to foreign and international judicial decisions, and interpreted
as counseling restraint in passing judgment on the sovereign acts of other
states; further, it has also been considered as a compelling reason to refrain
from adjudication in cases of international litispendence (actual or simply
foreseen)  and  a  significant  parameter  for  the  granting  of  anti-suit
injunctions.53

Comity, not entirely unlike equity, operates infra and praeter legem,
but never overrides a command of the sovereign.54 In practice, while the
transnational regulatory web has become denser, comity still remains a
useful tool in the hands of courts, capable as it is of operating as a lubri-
cant or counterbalancing “the inadequacy of the normative criteria” neces-
sary to solve jurisdictional conflicts.55
3. New Understandings of Comity
While sovereignty constitutes the traditional theoretical underpinning
of the doctrine, it does not follow that it covers the ways in which comity
has been used or necessarily matches the evolution of its understanding.
These changes have occurred through gradual—but radical—changes in the
backdrop of transnational adjudication, so that it has been referenced to
justify instances of deference to “the needs of the international commercial
system,”56 to support transnationally consistent interpretations of interna-
tional instruments (public or private alike),57 and, more generally, to fur-
ther  the  “mutual  interests  of  all  nations  in  a  smoothly  functioning
international legal regime.”58
Moreover, comity constitutes a key concept for understanding judicial
networks. Anne-Marie Slaughter has convincingly relied on this notion to
explain certain dynamics.59 In her view, comity constitutes one of the
building blocks of judicial dialogue occurring in the “global community”
of national and international courts, offering “the framework and the
ground rules for a global dialogue among judges in the context of specific
cases.”60 According to her model, courts would respect foreign courts “qua
courts . . . rather than simply as the face of a foreign government,” recog-
nizing them as “co-equals in the global task of judging,” though with a
distinctive emphasis on individual rights and the judicial role in protecting
them.61
To be sure, Slaughter’s theory is not without its critics and it has been

suggested that it is, to a large extent, quite starry-eyed.62 Yet, it has the
merit of emphasising the role of judges and arbitrators—national and inter-
national—as facilitators of the coordination of legal regimes.63 In this
guise, comity is a primary rule of conduct addressed to judges and arbitra-
tors, asking them to balance some of the variegated interests implied in
making one legal regime prevail over another in a specific instance.64 Such
a theory of comity underscores the importance of balancing efforts, and is
hardly “arbitrary and dangerous” as the traditional critique has often
suggested.65
C. Comity: A Summary
One problem with most of the scholarship on comity is that it almost
invariably defines the concept in the negative or indirectly.66 For the sake
of clarity and the discussion that follows, but without any claim of exhaus-
tiveness, we attempt to offer a positive, working definition. We understand
comity as a judicial tool which, pursuant to an accepted paradigm on the
allocation of regulatory authority (such as sovereignty), directs courts to
engage in acts of restraint or recognition. This concretely translates into
the following actions taken by courts: fine-tuning the reach of domestic
substantive law; resorting to discretionary abstention in case of actual or
foreseen jurisdictional conflicts; granting respect and recognition to the
judgments of their foreign counterparts or presuming that foreign law and
acts are valid; or otherwise respecting an expression of coequal authority
that does not infringe its external limits. By extension, the term comity
also designates the rationale for the set of judicial tools and techniques
developed to achieve these goals.
This understanding of comity essentially originates in private interna-
tional law. But as we will try to show, it can also helpfully be used—and
actually is helpfully used—in public international law. This is particularly
so in international adjudication, to which we now turn.
II. The Potential of Comity in International Adjudication
Comity, as we have already mentioned, is routinely used in domestic
adjudication, and not at all unheard of in international fora.67 Its re-emer-
gence, however, is linked to a specific phenomenon: the proliferation of
international courts and tribunals.68 In this context, the concept of comity

may have the potential to solve, or at least mitigate, some of the problems
arising from a disorderly multiplication of competing authorities.
A. Proliferation and its Implications
The multiplication of international judicial institutions is likely one of
the most significant developments to have ever occurred in the interna-
tional legal system. Its causes have been identified, on the one hand, in the
increased willingness of states to submit to international adjudication and,
on the other hand, in the inevitable specialisation of certain fields.69 A
burgeoning and spread of international courts and tribunals resulted, dif-
fering in their mandates, the rules they apply, the status of the parties to
the disputes they resolve, and the very inclusiveness of their jurisdictions—
which tend to grow more inclusive and difficult to elude as international
adjudication  moves  from  a  consensual  to  a  compulsory  paradigm.70
Proliferation is a divisive topic. For some, a numerous and diverse set of
judicial institutions may better serve the interests of justice, efficiency, and
party autonomy, because different approaches to the same matters can ulti-
mately spark legal development.71 Others contend that proliferation is a
reason for concern, both for the parties to the dispute and the international
legal system as a whole.72 If the problem is seen through this lens, the
value of comity comes quite naturally into focus. With more international
courts comes a greater risk of parallel proceedings, instances of forum
shopping, conflicting decisions, and diverging interpretations of the same
rules of law that may bring about “fragmentation” issues as a consequence
of the move towards specialisation.73 Conflicts may occur between inter-
national courts and tribunals and their counterparts, but can also easily
involve national courts.74 There exists ample room for inter-systemic and
infra-systemic conflicts, which have further complicated the resolution of
certain disputes and diminished the overall trust in international dispute
settlement.
The root of the problem is threefold: First, “general international law
does not provide for jurisdiction-regulating rules.”75 Second, in most cases
the  treaties  establishing  international  courts  and  tribunals  do  not
expressly provide rules governing their relationships with the jurisdictions

of their counterparts or national jurisdictions.76 Third, jurisdictional pro-
visions of individual international courts and tribunals are characterized
by some degree of rigidity: as James Crawford puts it, it is precisely this
lack of elasticity that produces the problems generally blamed on the
proliferation phenomenon.77
The use of comity has the potential of alleviating some of the problems
arising from this rigidity, improving coordination between overlapping
jurisdictions, and mitigating the undesired effects of unilateral forum shop-
ping by encouraging a sound management of simultaneously pending pro-
ceedings and the choice of the most suitable forum. Further, it can serve
as a theoretical basis to foster overall coordination between judicial bodies,
prompting them to accord respect to the decisions of other international
courts and tribunals and, more generally, creating a framework for their
jurisdictional interaction—a framework which at the same time encourages
cross-fertilization and “promotes the systematic nature of international
law.”78
B. Challenges in Using Comity for International Adjudication
A traditional understanding of comity, as we pointed out in section 1,
links it to sovereignty.79 Can a principle developed to deal with issues
regarding sovereignty—in a private international law dimension—be ade-
quately used to deal with jurisdictional arrangements within the interna-
tional judiciary? To answer the question, we first argue that horizontality,
which is at the heart of sovereignty, is not an inappropriate ordering model
for the relationship of the competences of international courts and tribu-
nals. This in turn leads us to the transposition of conflicts of law to regime
interactions. We finally take a step back from these considerations, which
are arguably overly doctrinal and insufficiently pragmatic, and turn to
comity as a tool of judicial reasoning.
1. Horizontality as an Ordering Model
The global arrangement of states is not so different from the global
arrangement of international judicial bodies. As James Crawford puts it,
comity “arises from the horizontal arrangements of state jurisdictions . . . .
and the field’s lack of a hierarchical system of norms.”80 In the interstate
system, horizontality is a consequence of the principle of sovereign equal-
ity of states; in the international system, it is the ordering model of the
“new style of public international law litigation.”81

2017 Comity and International Courts and Tribunals 589
It is true that not all international judicial bodies are created equal,
with some having, according to an accepted classification, universal juris-
diction ratione personae, others a regional mandate, a general competence
rationae materiae or a high degree of specialization.82 However, despite
some advocacy of a more central role for the International Court of Jus-
tice,83 no tribunal currently holds such a central function,84 and indeed
one should recall that when the problem concerns international tribunals,
“the notion of a court of a court of general jurisdiction is an inapt anal-
ogy.”85 Some may have greater jurisdictional reach, but none formally
stands out as hierarchically superior to the others: thus their potential
clashes still occur in a horizontal dimension.86
More intriguing is the problem of the exercise of comity by interna-
tional courts towards national courts, and vice versa. As a principle, com-
ity has sometimes been identified as the basis of particular aspects of the
relationship between courts of different orders.87 The broader question,
however, is whether it can help overcome the lack of jurisdictional rules
and principles governing the relationship of their competences.88 Sover-
eignty-based arguments may cut both ways, but at least they are useful in
justifying different types of “deferential review” concerning the acts of a
state.89

2. Conflict of Laws Analogies and Regime Interaction
If one takes on the view that jurisdictional clashes occur in a horizon-
tal dimension, conflict of laws analogies become alluring, in particular if
one has in mind the “jurisdictional” nature of these clashes.90 Such com-
parisons are not novel, and have been employed to describe the overlaps
between the functional jurisdictions of international organisations, which,
as was submitted, presented “a closer analogy with the problem of conflict
of laws than with the problem of conflicting obligations within the same
legal system.”91
There is merit in the idea of these analogies, but how far they can be
used in practice is a distinct question. From the perspective of an interna-
tional adjudicator, it is possible to single out rather useful doctrines, such
as those of governmental interest analysis or the “comparative impairment
principle.”92 With some simplification, the first requires the interpreter to
look to the specific policy goals underlying the provisions to be applied.93
The second “requires the interpreter to weigh the relative interests of the
conflicting legal systems” with a view to determining which among them
“would be most greatly impaired by a legal decision, assuming that that
decision were to become a general practice.”94
The main problem with these conflicts of law approaches is that, while
they are implemented at the judicial level, they mainly relate to choice of
law matters, and cannot do much for the resolution of jurisdictional con-
flicts—as  such—between  courts.  The  perspective  may  change  slightly
when it comes to the application of substantive law, or when international
adjudication is embedded, as it often is, in a certain “regime.” Granted, the
very use of the word regime, in the sense of “regime interactions,” which is
a loan from international relations literature, is somewhat controversial in
the field of international law.95 But it is not without analytical purchase.
Broadly, regime interactions scholarship deals with sets of norms, deci-
sion-making procedures and organisations coalescing around functional
issue-areas.96 More to the point, it addresses questions relating to overlaps

of these areas and their conflicts, and methods with which certain agents—
such  as  international  organisations—should engage in interaction and
accommodation, and the basis of any such power to do so.97 What we
must observe, in this regard, is that the function of an international court
cannot be easily isolated from the regime to which it pertains. Their judi-
cial process, and “the law-making that occurs contingently in litigation,”
have implications that have bearing on the interaction between different
regimes.98 In the search for a solution to jurisdictional conflicts, this per-
spective must perforce be taken into account.
3. Comity: Between Judicial Tool and Meta-Principle of Coordination
Comity may offer a possible solution to conflicts occurring between
international jurisdictions. As a concept, it pertains to the realm of judicial
reasoning and behavior. As Crawford and Nevill have observed, judges
and arbitrators owe allegiance to their jurisdictional mandate, and their
approaches in seeking coordination—rather  than  competition—between
different regimes might be described as a “meta-position,” or even as an
exercise  of  imagination.99  Still,  as  the  authors  continue,  there  is  no
“informing meta-principle” from which easy answers can be drawn.100
Rather,  when  jurisdictional  overlaps  between  international  courts  and
tribunals are seen as a form of regime conflict and interaction, we are left
with the troublesome realisation that no hard and fast rules exist for their
resolution, though concerns about legitimacy and the risk of managerial-
ism are hard to deflect.101
The arguments for hard rules and final arbiters are quite compelling,
but, so far, these are desiderata that do not lie in the realm of what is
accessible. What we do have, instead, is the understanding that conflicts
can be otherwise managed. “A problem,” Philip Jessup wrote in his Storrs
lectures, “may also be resolved not by the application of law (although
equally not in violation of law) but by a process of adjustment—an extrale-
gal or metajuridical means.”102 Comity is one such principle—or “meta-
principle.”103 Its potential, which we attempted to unpack in the previous
sections, is revealed by its historical evolution and continual application at
the domestic (so to speak) level. We submit that, lacking (unlikely) hierar-
chical solutions, comity may assist international courts and tribunals in
mediating  jurisdictional  conflicts  between  themselves,  balancing  their
coordination efforts with the need to provide justice in individual cases.104

Of course, “managerialism” is a risk, and the proposition that the
degree to which judges are required to strive for the “maintenance of the
integrity of the international legal system . . . [and] the broader idea of an
international rule of law’ is hardly uncontested.”105 Still, there is little
doubt that international adjudication has overcome its quasi-arbitral begin-
nings,106 and that, when it comes to the proper and sound administration
of justice (a concept, we should perhaps emphasise, which has deeper
moral implications than that of “the rule of law”107), community interests
(or something much akin to them) are at stake.108 As far as international
courts and tribunals are concerned, judges pursue these interests the best
way they can, through the use of shared assumptions, methodological
tools, the responsible use of legal doctrine, and—perhaps most impor-
tantly—with the limitations that their own profession calls for.109
Comity does not simply respond to the hopes for coordination within
the international judiciary—and, more broadly, the international legal sys-
tem. It is also something that international adjudicators can and know
how to employ in order to attain these goals.110 With this in mind, comity
can be employed to ease other types of conflict. For example, comity could
act as a principle informing the use by certain international tribunals of
extrasystemic elements imported from other legal regimes, for indeed the
use of such “outside law” is not devoid of complications and calls for a
careful balancing of the interests at stake.111

ment to alleviate the ill effects that derive from the pendency of parallel
proceedings in the same dispute.
1. The Regulation of Jurisdiction: Jurisdictional Clauses and General
Principles
General international law does not provide for rules governing the
jurisdiction of international courts and tribunals, but the constituting
instruments of the latter often do. Normally, they do so indirectly, namely
through their jurisdictional clauses. According to the classification pro-
posed by Yuval Shany, it is possible to distinguish between exclusive juris-
dictional clauses, barring litigation before any other forum, and non-
exclusive jurisdictional clauses.112 Exclusive jurisdiction clauses can be
further qualified as flexible or inflexible, depending on whether they can
be derogated from; non-exclusive jurisdiction clauses can be unqualified or
residual, such as Article 282 UNCLOS.113 The latter species of jurisdic-
tional clauses may be chosen for the purpose of limiting, to some extent,
unilateral forum shopping.114 In contrast, very few instruments include
rules intended to coordinate multiple proceedings and, more broadly,
mediate conflicts.115
Some have argued that, in the absence of a hierarchical system, the
instruments to achieve these results are to be found outside the framework
of their own legal order.”116 The central question is whether the vacuum
can be filled with general jurisdiction-regulating principles. One such
principle is res judicata, a preclusion doctrine aimed at protecting the final-
ity of the decision.117 Its applicability in international adjudication is well

accepted,118 though recent judicial practice demonstrates that there still is
some degree of uncertainty as to its practical operation.119 There is ample
agreement that for res judicata to apply strict conditions must be satisfied:
these are normally reduced to a “triple identity test,” which is intended to
ascertain that persona, petitum, and causa petendi of the multiple disputes
are in fact the same.120 In international adjudication, this is easier said
than done. Due to a plethora of different treaty regimes, jurisdiction and
cause of action are intimately linked and meeting the conditions for the
operation of the principle is unlikely.121 Further, especially in investment
arbitration, it is quite possible that multiple arbitrations will be initiated by
formally different entities.122 As a consequence, there is a renewed interest
in less restrictive doctrine such as issue estoppel.123
While res judicata is intended to shield from the undesired conse-
quences of sequential proceedings, lis alibi pendens deals with parallel pro-
ceedings, giving priority to the ones first established.124 Compared to res
judicata, its applicability in international adjudication does not enjoy the
same widespread support.125 Overall, the number of cases involving the
principle has been comparatively low, and no tribunal has authoritatively
pronounced on the issue.126 Further, the status of lis pendens as a general
principle of law has been disputed on the grounds that it is mainly a civil
law doctrine,127 and, it too requires the satisfaction of a strict triple iden-
tity test.128

2017 Comity and International Courts and Tribunals 595
Moreover, while the application of res judicata enjoys virtually univer-
sal support as a matter of policy, the use of lis pendens has, at least on
occasion, been criticised. First, it has been observed that the simple fact
that a tribunal has already been given jurisdiction does not constitute a
guarantee that a dispute will be settled.129 Second, it has been argued that
the increase in litigation costs is a minor and, in any event, secondary issue
in international adjudication.130 This proposition is not entirely convinc-
ing, and does not take into account other adverse effects of duplicative liti-
gation on any given dispute.131 Third, and perhaps more interesting, is the
contention that the pendency of parallel proceedings could be an incentive
for proverbially slow tribunals to issue their judgment first, a result that
can only be achieved if res judicata applies and lis alibi pendens does not
(encouraging a “race to ruling,” rather than a race to court).132
2. On the Exercise of Jurisdiction: Comity and Inherent Powers
In the current international dispute settlement scenario, comity has
appeal as a technique for the management of jurisdictional conflicts arising
from the commencement of multiple proceedings before different courts or
tribunals.
When domestic courts employ comity, they do so by dismissing or
staying proceedings; thus, they adopt a decision not to exercise a jurisdic-
tion that they indubitably have.133 The resolution of conflicts concerning
the allocation of regulatory (or jurisdictional) authority tends to take this
form, demanding the surrender of legal (or judicial) authority from one
legal system or regime to another.134 The same applies in international
adjudication, where coordinating efforts have been broadly labelled as
exercises in avoidance and temporization.135
Judicial discretion of this kind has faced comparatively few challenges
at the domestic level, at least in common law countries, where it is more
characteristic; doubts, as to the authority of a court of general jurisdiction,
remain the exception.136 Things tend to be different for international
tribunals: do they or do they not have the power to stay or dismiss proceed-

ings? To be sure, it is possible for such a power to be provided for
expressly.137 However, the constitutive instruments of international courts
and tribunals are seldom exhaustive and, in order to fill the gap, reliance
has been placed on alternative sources of procedural rules and the more
controversial concept of “inherent power.”138
One possible solution is to qualify comity as a principle of interna-
tional law139 or a general principle of law in the sense of Article 38(1)(c) of
the Statute of the International Court of Justice.140 Debates as to the suita-
bility of such principles to constitute a source of procedural law have been
largely overcome, and the proposition that that “no sharp distinction”
exists in international law between substantive and adjectival aspects is
relatively uncontroversial.141 It must be pointed out, however, that the
scarcity of practice does not appear to warrant the conclusion that comity
fits squarely in the first category. By the same token, the fact that the prin-
ciple of comity does not enjoy universal acceptance at the domestic level
seems to militate against it inclusion in the second.142
A preferable alternative is to find the source of discretion not to exer-
cise jurisdiction in the inherent powers of international courts and tribu-
nals.143 As Judge Higgins observed in her separate opinion in the Use of
Force cases, the inherent powers of a tribunal include that of not exercising
a jurisdiction that it has.144 Specifically, such powers are a corollary of the
judicial character of the tribunal and descend from the need to protect the
integrity of the judicial process.145 Their exercise is thus to be considered
possible, if exceptional.146 In other words, in this approach, inherent pow-

2017 Comity and International Courts and Tribunals 597
ers must be justified on the basis of the function of the international court
concerned—and, arguably, of the general function of international adjudi-
cation. This last point warrants further consideration as it implies the
question of whether the role of international courts and tribunals should
be restricted to the settlement of the particular dispute between the parties
or have wider implications.147
The “inherent powers” approach is advantageous for two main rea-
sons: first, it allows rejecting the misconstruction of comity as a jurisdic-
tional rule and qualifying it as a set of principles that should inform the
exercise of jurisdiction.148 Second, it allows dispensing with an express
provision of the power to stay or dismiss proceedings in the constitutive
instrument of the tribunal. Nevertheless, there are limits to its operation.
In general, a provision or a effect of either the constitutive instrument as a
whole or the very function of an international tribunal could exclude the
existence of an inherent power.149 It is doubtful, for example, whether an
exclusive jurisdictional clause could warrant the exercise of such discre-
tion. By the same token, it questionable whether certain dispute settlement
bodies possess the discretion to stay proceedings.
The case of the WTO dispute settlement mechanism can provide a
useful illustration of the problem. Some have questioned the existence of
such discretion for the panels for different reasons. For example, some
have contended that they lack inherent powers due to the atypical nature of
such bodies: a power to suspend proceedings would thus have to be based
on different grounds.150 Others have argued for the exclusion of a power
to stay proceedings on the grounds of the strict procedures and timeframes
the  panels  must  respect.151  Finally,  in  Mexico–Soft  Drinks  the  Panel
rejected Mexico’s request not to exercise its jurisdiction maintaining that it
did not have “discretion to decide whether or not to exercise [it] in a case

the appellate body are not plagued with a complete lack of power to regulate their pro-
ceedings, but still have to base its decision on a positive grant of authority under the
World Trade Organization (WTO) Dispute Settlement Understanding (DSU). He con-
cludes that it would be possible for a panel or the Appellate Body to suspend its proceed-
ings on the basis of the Working Procedures they can adopt under Article 12.1 (or 17.9,
for the Appellate Body) DSU irrespective of the consent of the parties. As the Working
Procedures are adopted for the purpose of hearing a particular case, it would not be
possible to use them to decline jurisdiction altogether, but the result of a suspension of
proceedings might be attainable. Lorand Bartels, The Separation of Powers in the WTO:

properly before it.”152 The Appellate Body upheld the approach followed
by the Panel in Mexico–Soft Drinks, arguing that the Panel would not have
fulfilled its mandate of making “an objective assessment of the matter
before it, including an objective assessment of the facts of the case and the
applicability of and conformity with the relevant covered agreements” if it
had declined to exercise a validly established jurisdiction.153 According to
Caroline Henckels, such an approach is rooted in “arid textualism” and
might be overcome by paying due regard to the purpose of the WTO dis-
pute settlement mechanism.154 Comity, she further argues, could thus be
used upon meeting the high threshold of “an inextricable connection to an
antecedent or concurrent dispute under another trade instrument . . . bear-
ing in mind the need to ensure stability and predictability in the interna-
tional trading system.”155 Such a conclusion seems correct in principle.
What is more, it is also buttressed by the recent practice of some interna-
tional courts and tribunals, which have demonstrated an increasing will-
ingness to suspend proceedings before them.156 However, the extent to
which other tribunals will be willing to do so is still unknown.
3. The Potential of Comity: Advantages and Drawbacks
The application of the doctrine of comity has a number of advantages.
First of all, as a general abstention doctrine, it does not need to be provided
for expressly in the constitutive instrument of the tribunal concerned—pro-
vided that the tribunal possesses the powers necessary to exercise comity it
constitutes a readily available remedy against the dangers of abusive litiga-
tion.157 Second, and more attractive, its flexible character allows the deci-
sion-maker to defer the dispute to the jurisdiction of other tribunals in a
number of cases, without the need to satisfy the strict requirements of
either res judicata, lis alibi pendens and, where similarities apply, electa una
via provisions. Third, comity is predicated on the postulate that the tribu-
nal exercising it has jurisdiction, in that it is not necessarily different from
the principles considered above, which are more accurately classified as
concerning the admissibility of claims.158 But, one might make the argu-
ment that res judicata and lis alibi pendens are hard-edged principles. Spe-
cifically, they are preclusion doctrines; as a consequence, as soon as the
requirements for their operation are met, they bar the adjudicator from
entertaining the dispute.159 In contrast, the doctrine of comity simply

2017 Comity and International Courts and Tribunals 599
results in a tribunal using its discretion and refraining from exercising a
jurisdiction it has when hearing the case would not be appropriate. As a
consequence, it does not deprive the tribunal of its power to hear the dis-
pute when the reasons not to do so (such as, for example, simultaneously
pending proceedings), albeit formally compelling, prove shaky as a matter
of substance.
Using comity is not entirely unproblematic: its operation is subject to
the tribunal exercising discretion, an idea that many constituencies could
find problematic when associated with adjudication. From the parties’
perspective, preclusion arguments may indeed be more attractive: a tribu-
nal may have variegated reasons to be hesitant in declining to exercise its
jurisdiction. Its members may simply be convinced that they do not have
the power to make this decision, and err on the side of caution and give the
parties their proverbial “day in court.” Reluctance of this kind may also
occur even if there is no legal impediment: the conduct of the international
judiciary, just as of any body of individuals, is not only affected by consid-
erations of justice and the parties’ interests. For example, as Cesare P. R.
Romano points out, permanent tribunals could be reluctant to defer a dis-
pute to other judicial bodies due to the fear that doing so could negatively
affect their status in the area of international dispute settlement and the
problematic correlation between caseload and funding.160 In contrast, the
members of an arbitral tribunal can be said to have, from a law and eco-
nomics perspective, a vested interest in making the dispute reach the merits
stage. It makes sense for them to increase the demand for arbitration.161
And, of course, even then mistakes may be made. For example, in the
MOX Plant case, the Annex VII Tribunal relied on comity to avoid a juris-
dictional conflict, and, insofar as it based the decision on the virtually cer-
tain involvement of the European Court of Justice, its approach seems to be
informed by a correct, if overly prudent and deferential, understanding of
the principle.162 But, as Campbell McLachlan has observed, the tribunal
adopted its decision before the European Court, which undoubtedly has
the competence to decide on its jurisdiction, was even seized of the dis-
pute.163 It is thus arguable that, had the tribunal decided otherwise, its
exercise of jurisdiction would not have infringed comity as no one had
initiated proceedings; perhaps, most importantly—the risk of leaving Ire-
land without any proceedings against the United Kingdom was a real
one.164

III. Mentions of Comity by International Courts and Tribunals
The foregoing sections have sought to clarify, at a theoretical level, the
potential and shortcomings of the use of comity in international adjudica-
tion. In this section, we look more empirically at cases, which use comity.
A. Comity as Opposed to “Legal Obligations”
First of all, in some of the cases, international courts and tribunals
have employed the notion of comity to clarify the legal nature of an obliga-
tion. For example, in Fisheries Jurisdiction, Judge Dillard appended a sepa-
rate opinion in which he argued “in practice States accord deference to the
twelve-mile limit as a matter of legal obligation and not merely as a matter
of reciprocal tolerance or comity.”165
In Nuclear Tests (Australia v. France) the concept was only mentioned
in passing in Judge Barwick’s dissent, in which he criticized the view that
the dispute at issue was only a political difference “as to whether France
ought or ought not in comity to cease to test in the atmosphere of the South
Pacific.”166 In his opinion, there was a legal dispute and that the Court’s
finding that Australia application had no object was incorrect.167
Again, in Avena, the issue of comity was raised in Mexico’s argument
at the provisional measures stage.168 On the basis of a declaration by the
President of the United States to the effect that the nation will “discharge
its international obligations under the decision of the International Court
of Justice . . . in accordance with general principles of comity.”169 Mexico
argued that the United States’ reference to comity the made clear that it did
not believe to have any legal obligation.170 The Court did not address the
issue.171 Finally, in Jurisdictional  Immunities, the Court referred to the
concept of comity to observe that the parties were in agreement as to the
applicable law and, in particular, they agreed that “immunity is governed
by international law and is not a mere matter of comity.”172
The European Court of Human Rights espoused a similar interpreta-
tion of the term in Mamatkulov.173 In this case, the Court observed that
previous practice had described the practice of complying with interim

measures as “a matter of expediency and comity.”174
B. Comity as Non-Interference
In a second group of cases, references to comity were made in connec-
tion with non-interference arguments.
The principle was referred to in Loewen as the source of the require-
ment of “continuous nationality.”175 According to the tribunal, the princi-
ple arose as a consequence of the fact that “[i]t was not normally the
business of one nation to be interfering into the manner in which another
nation handled its internal commerce.”176
Two cases of the Court of Justice of the European Communities con-
cerned issues of regulation of competition: the first, Ahlstro¨m v. Commis-
sion, was part of the joined “wood pulp” cases.177 The comity argument
was raised by a number of Canadian applicants contended that regulating
their  conduct—relating  to  activities  performed  outside  of,  but  having
effects within Europe—the Commission had “infringed Canada’s sover-
eignty and thus breached the principle of international comity.”178 The
Court quickly dismissed the argument, stating that it amounted to ques-
tioning the Community’s jurisdiction to apply its competition rules.179
IBM v. Commission concerned entirely similar issues, the main difference
being that the conduct of the claimant was not only performed in another
jurisdiction (the United States), but also the subject of legal proceedings
there.180 The Court did not address the claim, and dismissed it on other
grounds.181 To this day, the Court has not modified its approach, and a
recent decision by the General Court referring to Ahlstro¨m reveals that the
timeworn dictum withstands the test of time.182
C. Comity and the Management of Multiple Proceedings
In a third category of cases, references to comity concerned the coordi-
nation of multiple proceedings relating to the same dispute pending before
different national or international judicial bodies.
Perhaps the best-known instance of the use of comity was considered
in relation to parallel proceedings is the early ICSID case Southern Pacific

Properties.183 The dispute at issue had been referred to arbitration before
the International Chamber of Commerce and only later ICSID proceedings
were initiated.184 As domestic proceedings concerning the arbitration
clause were pending before the French Cour de Cassation, the Tribunal was
faced with the request to decline its jurisdiction.185 Eventually, the tribu-
nal stayed its proceedings, but went to great lengths to clarify that, it was
doing so “in the interest of international judicial order, in its discretion and
as a matter of comity.”186 In its view, there was no rule of international
law preventing two tribunals whose jurisdictions extended to the same dis-
pute from exercising such jurisdiction.187
Questions relating to comity were considered again in the MOX Plant
case.188 There the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) Annex VII Tribu-
nal relied on “considerations of mutual respect and comity which should
prevail between judicial institutions” to justify the suspension of its pro-
ceedings in the face of a virtually certain involvement of the European
Court of Justice.189 Such an occurrence would have excluded the Tribu-
nal’s jurisdiction under Article 282 of the UNCLOS.190 Comity was also
mentioned in the separate opinion appended by Judge Treves to the Order
on Provisional Measures issued by the International Tribunal for the Law
of the Sea in the same dispute.191 Treves regretted that a discussion on the
existence and content “of a customary law rule or of a general principle
concerning the consequences of litispendence, as well as considerations of
economy of legal activity and of comity between courts and tribunals’ had
not been included in the order.”192
Comity arguments were also raised in Itera International Energy.193
The respondent maintained that the claimant was trying to bring before the
ICSID Tribunal, under the cloak of ancillary claims, a wholly separate dis-
pute, which was already the subject of separate proceedings before the
International Commercial Arbitration Court of the Russian Chamber of
Commerce.194 These proceedings had been initiated by the claimant and
had been going on for three years.195 According to the respondent, the
Tribunal’s dismissal of these claims would have avoided potentially con-
flicting decisions and served the interests of “efficiency and comity.”196

2017 Comity and International Courts and Tribunals 603
Eventually, the claims were not found to arise from the same dispute and
the Tribunal did not address the issue of comity.197
The issue of comity was raised again in Achmea.198 The European
Commission had submitted written observations to propose a stay of the
PCA proceedings in order to avoid a potential conflict between its decision
and an ensuing ECJ ruling.199 It suggested that the PCA adopted the same
approach embraced in MOX Plant, where the arbitral tribunal had con-
cluded that “considerations of mutual respect and comity” warranted a
stay of proceedings. According to the Commission, such considerations
formed “part of the general principles of law that the Tribunal must apply
by virtue of Article 8(6) of the [Bilateral Investment Treaty].”200 Ulti-
mately, the Tribunal concluded that while the it wished to organize its pro-
ceedings “with full regard for considerations of mutual respect and comity
as regards other courts and institutions” it did not consider the questions
at issue “so far coextensive with the claims in the present case” to warrant a
suspension of the proceedings.201 Yet, the tribunal left open the possibility
of a later suspension if it were to become clear, “that the relationship
between the two sets of proceedings is so close as to be a cause of procedu-
ral unfairness or serious inefficiency.”202
Finally, questions concerning comity and the management of multiple
proceedings  were  discussed,  rather  thoroughly,  in  British  Caribbean
Bank.203 In that case, the Respondent invoked the precedents of Southern
Pacific Properties and MOX Plant to argue that, when parallel proceedings
are pending, a tribunal may “in its discretion and as a matter of comity”
stay the exercise of its jurisdiction.204 The argument was accepted as a
matter of principle, and the Tribunal admitted that it had “a measure of
discretion with respect to the timing and conduct of the arbitration and
that municipal judicial proceedings may sometimes need to be taken into
account in the exercise of international comity.”205 However, the Tribunal
also observed that any such discretion “must be carefully exercised,” for to
do otherwise would have amounted to “[permitting] comity to frustrate a
claimant’s right to the arbitral forum and, potentially, to the relief offered
by the bilateral investment treaty under which the arbitration proceedings
were commenced.”206 In this respect, the Tribunal observed the situation
in the case at issue was entirely different from the precedent cited, as a stay
would not have been motivated by either an exclusive jurisdictional clause

included in a contract (as in Socie´t´e Ge´n´erale de Surveillance (“SGS”) or
the exclusive jurisdiction vested in a certain forum by a treaty.207 What is
more, its determinations did not depend from the result of any action
before the domestic court, and, even then, none were currently pending.208
D. Comity as Respect and Recognition
International juridical bodies have also relied on comity in order to
assist their reasoning about the respect to be granted to what we may
broadly refer to as the regulatory space of states: what faith and credit
should be accorded to states regarding their own conduct? What are the
appropriate evidential weight, evidential requirements, and standards of
review for the conduct of states? Four cases point the way.
In Soufraki, an investment arbitration, a reference to comity appears in
Omar Nabulsi’s dissenting opinion.209 The question concerned certifi-
cates of nationality issued by the Italian government.210 According to
Nabulsi, the tribunal had the power to make determinations of nationality,
but these had to be made in accordance with the proper law, which was, in
the case at issue, Italian law.211 In his view, “The Tribunal’s application of
rules other than the substantive rules of Italian law would be a manifest
excess of power.”212 Nabulsi went on to ask whether the “Act of State”
doctrine applied to the issue.213 This would have required that the tribu-
nal “abstain[s] from inquiring into the validity of acts of the government of
another country,” namely the certificates of nationality.214 He answered
the question in the negative, finding that the doctrine did not apply to
international tribunals whose jurisdiction depends on the parties’ nation-
ality.215 So the power of the tribunal to go beyond official certificates was
not up for debate.216 Yet, and this is the key point, he maintained that the
concept of “comity” required that “international tribunals should accord
respect to official certificates by treating them as “prima facie evidence.”217
A similar reference to comity and evidence, though dealing with a
qualitatively different issue, was made in Tokios Tokel¨es (also an investment
arbitration).218 The tribunal held that, when addressing the issue of alle-
gations made against persons or bodies “in a position of [state] authority,”
evidentiary requirements could not be “heightened purely on the grounds
of deference or comity or otherwise.”219

2017 Comity and International Courts and Tribunals 605
In CCL, a commercial arbitration decided by a Stockholm Chamber of
Commerce Tribunal, the issue of comity was raised with reference to the
possibility of reviewing the conduct of a foreign state.220 The principle
was invoked by the respondent, who argued that “as a matter of interna-
tional comity” the Tribunal should have been hesitant to review the acts of
Kazakhstan in its sovereign and judicial capacity, acting to enforce its laws
against its own government agency, absent a blatant abuse of power, which
clearly is not the case.221 The Tribunal “should at least give the sovereign,
non-commercial acts of Kazakhstan the deference that comity requires.”222
The claimant was lucky enough that comity was such an ambiguous con-
cept, shrouded in misunderstandings, rarely if ever seriously examined—a
situation explained, as we may recall from the introduction to this Article,
by lawyers’ generally dismissive attitude for the concept. Hence the claim-
ant could safely argue that comity was a public international law concept
referring to “non-binding rules of politeness, convenience and goodwill
observed by sovereign states in their mutual dealings.”223 A tribunal not
being a sovereignty state, it followed that the reference to comity was mis-
placed.224 The Tribunal tagged along, holding that the concept of comity
had no applicability in arbitration.225 Further, it stated that it had not
been shown that “such a legal principle is part of any known laws or rules
concerning  international  commercial  arbitration,  including  Swedish  or
Kazakh arbitration law.”226 It thus concluded that there was no legal basis
for it to abstain from reviewing the acts of the respondent solely because it
was a sovereign state and that comity was not, under the arbitration clause,
a bar to the exercise of jurisdiction.227
While less straightforward, the reference to comity in the Second Pro-
cedural Order in ADF can also be included under this heading.228 In the
decision, concerning the place of arbitration, the Tribunal relayed the
United States argument voicing its commitment to “facilitating interna-
tional  arbitration,”  and  considered  the  approach  of  the  United  States
Supreme Court on the matter.229 In particular, the Tribunal relied on the
deferential approach epitomised in Mitsubishi v Soler, which we discussed
supra, I B. 3.230
A comity argument was again raised by the respondent state in Rail-

road Development Corporation.231 The case was about Guatemala’s use of a
legal process known as lesividad or lesivo, which serves to declare an activ-
ity harmful to the interests of the state.232 Guatemala maintained that this
process was not in itself contrary to the minimum standard of treat-
ment.233 Finding otherwise, Guatemala argued, would in effect “under-
mine the requirement that fair and equitable treatment be determined by a
case-specific, fact-based inquiry, and would violate notions of comity and
sovereignty.”234 The investment arbitral tribunal dodged the issue of com-
ity and merely found that the procedure had been abused.235
A similar argument was raised by one of the parties in Hesham T.M. Al
Warraq.236  Appearing  as  the  Respondent,  Indonesia  argued  that  the
Claimant’s accusation that the decisions of the domestic courts had been
“unfair and unjust” amounted to “a grave charge against the independent
judiciary of one of the world’s largest democracies.”237 Accordingly, “[t]he
principle of comity alone” required the Tribunal to act on the presumption
that the Indonesian Court had acted properly.238
More recently, comity arguments were also considered by a PCA tribu-
nal in Chevron and Texaco v. Ecuador.239 The decision on Track 1B is par-
ticularly interesting: the claimants had requested, among other things, a
declaratory award stating that the Lago Agrio Judgment “violate[d] interna-
tional public policy and natural justice, and that as a matter of interna-
tional comity and public policy . . . [it] should not be recognised and
enforced.”240 The Tribunal noted that “whilst not strictly bound to follow
their result or reasoning as a matter of international law, this Tribunal
would have wished to be guided, as regards any relevant issue of Ecuado-
rian law, by the decisions of the Lago Agrio Court, the Appellate Court of
Lago Agrio and the Cassation Court.”241 Such an approach, the Tribunal
was eager to remark, “would extend beyond courtesy, comity and due
respect for the Respondent’s judicial branch.”242 Ultimately, the Tribunal
found that the circumstances of the case—namely the multiple allegations
of denial of justice raised by the claimants—militated against the adoption
of one such approach.243

2017 Comity and International Courts and Tribunals 607
E. Comity and Precedent
The idea that precedents—in the non-technical meaning of “prior
cases”—of other tribunals should be followed, because of comity, was
entertained in the ICSID case Tulip Real Estate.244 The parties had referred
the Tribunal to prior decisions of various international judicial bodies.245
Here is what the Tribunal thought of it: “[a]lthough not bound by such
citations . . . as a matter of comity, it should have regard to earlier deci-
sions of courts (particularly the ICJ) and of other international dispute
tribunals engaged in the interpretation of the terms of a [Bilateral Invest-
ment Treaty].”246
Interestingly, the Tribunal also considered issues of hierarchy: the
respondent submitted that the Tribunal accord preference to the decisions
of the International Court of Justice; the claimant maintained that ICSID
tribunal decisions were more relevant.247 The Tribunal concluded that
both sources could inform its interpretation of the terms of the BIT accord-
ing to their rigour and persuasiveness.248
F. Comity as Neighborliness, Cooperation, and Respect for Other
Sovereign Entities
In other cases, the term comity comes up as a catchall expression,
covering neighborliness and respect for the sovereign prerogatives of other
states.
In Passage Through the Great Belt, Judge Broms mentions comity in a
separate opinion, arguing that the dispute at issue could be resolved by the
use of negotiations if the parties negotiated “in the best Nordic spirit of
comity and co-operation.”249 Nordic spirits notwithstanding, it is hard to
ascribe any certain meaning, beyond the general idea of co-operation, to
this invocation of comity.
The European Court of Human Rights has, in turn, invoked the con-
cept several times with reference to the question of the grant of sovereign
immunities in civil proceedings. The Court has addressed the issue several
times to assess whether such a grant of immunity could unduly limit one’s
right to access a court.250 Under the European Convention of Human
Rights, limitations to rights such as the one of access to a court must,
among other things, pursue a legitimate aim.251 Since 2001, the Court has

consistently argued that the grant of sovereign immunity does just that.252
It “is a concept of international law, developed out of the principle par in
parem non habet imperium, by virtue of which one State shall not be subject
to the jurisdiction of another State.”253 Its grant thus “pursues the legiti-
mate aim of complying with international law to promote comity and good
relations  between  States  through  the  respect  of  another  State’s
sovereignty.”254
The concept was also invoked in an unclear fashion in Certain Ques-
tions of Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters.255 The issue of comity was
raised in an argument by Djibouti about a witness summons issued under
French law to the Djiboutian head of state.256 Djibouti contended that
France would have been required to take preventive measures to protect the
immunity and dignity of a head of state on its territory on an official visit
(as per Article 29 of the VCDR).257 France was thus responsible for “inter-
nationally wrongful acts consisting of infringements of the principles of
international comity and of the customary and conventional rules relating
to immunities.”258 The Court ultimately found that the defects in the sum-
mons were not unambiguously attributable to France and eluded the inter-
pretation of the term “comity.”259
More recently, mentions of the principle in the European Court of
Human Rights case law have arguably leaned toward more qualified forms
of neighborliness; for example, in a recent case one judge has emphasized
the role of the Court in ensuring the uniform application of the 1980
Hague Convention on Child Abduction furthers comity among States.260
In yet another case it was argued that “reasons of international comity and
practicality” could have called for an effort by a state party to the Conven-
tion, which had become a source of migrants, to assist other states in the
implementation of their immigration rules and policies.261
It is arguable that the European Commission employed the term to the
same ends in one of the Kadi cases. The Court of First Instance relayed the

they are designed to protect all States against terrorist attacks,” but did not
discuss the remarkable claim.262
The European Court of Justice has later used the term in a different
way in the context of a reference for a preliminary ruling concerning the
interpretation of a directive for the protection of workers.263 The case con-
cerned the closure of a United States military base in the United Kingdom,
where the United States argued that the application of the directive con-
cerned to such a strategic decision would have been incompatible with
“principles of public international law, in particular the principle of jus
imperii and that of the ‘comity of nations.”264 The Court, however, did not
decide the issue on the grounds that it did not have jurisdiction, as the
situation did not fall within the scope of the directive.265
Conclusion
This study has sought to clarify the importance, current and potential,
of the use of comity by international courts and tribunals. Our findings
support the idea that comity might be an emerging principle of procedural
law,  though  agreement  on  its  exact  meaning—or unequivocal choices
among its many connotations—still tends to be uncommon. We submit
that, as long as other solutions are not in place, the principle can be suc-
cessfully employed to assist international courts and tribunals in mediat-
ing jurisdictional conflicts between themselves by balancing coordination
efforts and the demands of justice in the individual cases.
Comity may serve as a meta-principle of coordination between inter-
national judicial bodies, to be employed in the pursuit of the common
interest to an efficient and fair system of international dispute settlement.
There are strong reasons militating in favour of this proposition: interna-
tional tribunals, by and large, possess the powers necessary to exercise it;
international judges and arbitrators know how to use it; and its long his-
tory of applications at the domestic level suggests that it can be employed
successfully for a variety of purposes.
We also submit the hunch that comity may most likely be employed as
a central principle for further aspects of the coordination of international
adjudication, for instance informing the sound use of analogical reasoning
and precedent-borrowing process. Further study will be required to assess
the potential of comity in this context. We have, so far, restricted ourselves
to a simpler and more crucial task, seeking to resituate the principle of
comity as one on which to rely for the resolution of different types of con-
flicts between international jurisdictions, and to question the traditional
