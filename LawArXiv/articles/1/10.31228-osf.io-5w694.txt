COMPELLED  STATEMENTS
FROM POLICE OFFICERS
AND  GARRITY  MMUNITY
STIEVEN D. CLYMER*
In this Article; Professor Steven Clyner describes the problem created when police
departments require officers suspected of misconduct to answer internala ffairs in-
vestigators' questions orf ace job ternination. Relying on the Supreme Courtisd e-
cision in  Garrity  v.  New Jersey,  courts treat such compelled statements as
immunized testimony. That treatment not only renders such a statement inadnissi-
ble in a criminalp rosecution of the suspect police officer, it also may require tile
prosecution to shoulder the daunting and sometimes insurmountable burden of
demonstrating that its physical evidence, witness testimony, and strategic decision-
making are untainted by the statement Because police internala ffairs investigators
decide whether to take and disseminate compelled statements from police officers,
prosecutorsa re powerless to prevent the problen  Yet, as Professor Clymer shows,
the Garrity doctrinhe as applied by lower courts, has an uncertainf oundation. The
Supreme Court never has addressedt he full range of protections that courts often
bestow on compelled statements, such as prohibitions on nonevidentiary and indi-
rect evidentiary use  Furthermore; these stringent use restrictions are difficult to
square with the less robust protection that courts afford coerced confessions and
with the need to addressp olice criminality effectively.  While rejecting tie proposi-
tion that the Court should overrule Garrity, Clymer argues that courts should relax
prohibitions on collateralu ses of compelled statements. Clymer also suggests that
policymakers requirep olice departments to use sanctions less severe than job termi-
nation to prompt police officers to answer questions during administrativei nvesti-
gations. Threats of lesser sanctions often will be sufficient to encourage police
officers to answer and will do so without triggering Garrity immunity  This ap-
proachf airly balancest he competing interests of police departments,p olice officers,
and prosecutors in cases of alleged police criminality.

In recent  years,  several  weU-publicized  events  have  rekindled
public concern about police corruption and the use of excessive force.

Such incidents often generate demands for more vigorous admin-
istrative  oversight, harsh discipline,  and criminal  prosecution  of in-
volved  police  officers.7  Those  responses-administrative  penalties
and criminal prosecution-are the principal means of punishing police
officers who commit crimes.8  There is, however, a troubling conflict
There is no consensus on the frequency with which police engage in corruption or use
excessive force.  On corruption, see, for example, U.S. Gen. Accounting Office, GAO/
GGD-98-111, Law Enforcement:  Information on Drug-Related Police Corruption 3,10-14
(1998) which notes that because of the absence of federally collected "data specifically on
drug-related police corruption...  it was not possible to estimate the overall extent of the
problem," and Comm'n to Investigate Allegations of Police Corruption and the Anti-Cor-
ruption Procedures of the Police Dep't, City of New York, Commission Report 10 (1994)
[hereinafter Mollen Comm'n Rep.], which notes the difficulty in gauging the extent of po-
lice corruption in New York City.
On use of excessive force, compare Kenneth Adams, What We Know About Police
Use of Force, in Nat'l Institute of Justice, U.S. Dep't of Justice, Use of Force by Police 3-6
(NCJ 176330, Oct. 1999) ("Whether measured by use-of-force reports, citizen complaints,
victim surveys, or observational methods, the data consistently indicate that only a small
percentage of police-public interactions involve the use of force."), with John V. Jacobi,
Prosecuting Police Misconduct, 2000 Wis. L Rev. 789,802 ("Evidence from both individual
incidents and systematic study reports strongly suggests widespread police violence entirely
unjustified by the requirements of public safety."), and Human Rights Watch, supra, at 25-
26 (finding that "police brutality is persistent" in New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago,
Boston, District of Columbia, Atlanta, Detroit, and other large American cities).  See also
U.S. Comm'n on Civil Rights, Police Practices and Civil Rights in New York City, ch. 4
(2000), http:lwww.usccr.govlnypolprc  (describing "differing perspectives of the actual level
of police misconduct in New York City"); Fox Butterfield, When the Police Shoot, Who's
Counting, N.Y. Times, Apr. 29,2001, § 4, at 5 ("[S]tatistics on police shootings and use of
nondeadly force continue to be piecemeal products of spotty collection.").  A recent survey
of 80,543 persons revealed that in 1999, police used or threatened to use force against
approximately one percent of persons  with whom they had face-to-face  contact.  See
Patrick A. Langan et aL, U.S. Dep't of Justice, Contacts Between Police and the Public:
Findings From the 1999 National Survey 6 (NCJ 184957, Feb. 2001). Approximately three-
quarters of persons reporting a threat or use of force stated their belief that the threat or
force used was excessive.  Id. at 26.  There is evidence that police corruption and use of
excessive force are related problems.  See Paul Chevigny, The Edge of the Knife: Police
Violence in the Americas 78-79 (1995) ("[Tlhe police who talked to the [Mollen] commis-
sion thought of their corrupt as well as their brutal acts as aspects of vigilante justice.");
Mollen Comm'n Rep., supra, at 45-46 (noting that, based on testimonial and empirical
sources, "corruption seemingly has a relationship with a penchant for brutality").
7 See, e.g., Human Rights Watch, supra note 6, at 10-24 (recommending measures to
address "obstacles to justice, problems of investigation and discipline, and public accounta-
bility and transparency").  Those making proposals sometimes question whether police de-
partments and local prosecutors will conduct unbiased investigations and often suggest
involvement  by  independent  monitors  or  federal  prosecutors.  See,  e.g.,  Erwin
Chemerinsky, Perspective on the LAPD Scandal, L.A. Times, Feb. 15,2000, at B7 (recom-
mending "an external watchdog...  charged by law with the task of investigating police
wrongdoing and bringing disciplinary actions and criminal prosecutions where appropri-
ate"). For a discussion of the differences between local and federal prosecution of police,
see generally Laurie L. Levenson, The Future of State and Federal Civil Rights Prosecu-
tions:  The Lessons of the Rodney King Trial, 41 UCLA L  Rev. 509 (1994).
8 Another sanction is revocation of the suspect officer's state certification.  For a dis-
cussion of this option, see generally Roger L  Goldman & Steven Puro, Revocation  of
HeinOnline -- 76 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 1311 2001

between  them.  Departmental  misconduct  probes  can and  often  do
impair or even foreclose otherwise viable criminal investigations  and
prosecutions.  Indeed, an independent panel formed  in the wake  of
the Rampart scandal recently concluded that LAPD's administrative
investigations  "seriously compromise[]  criminal  investigations  of of-
ficer-involved  shootings and major use of force incidents .... 
"
How does this happen?  In many police departments, as part of
administrative inquiries into alleged misconduct, internal affairs inves-
tigators take statements  from the police officers  who were involved
either  as participants  or witnesses.  Statutes, regulations,  or depart-
mental  policies  often  impose  penalties,  including  job  termination,
against officers who refuse to answer questions during such inquiries.
When  police  officers  faced  with  sanctions  answer  questions,  many
courts, relying on the Supreme Court's 1967 decision in Garrity v. New
Jersey,'°  treat officers'  "compelled  statements"  as  the equivalent  of
formally  immunized testimony.  Although  such "Garrity immunity"
does not bar later prosecution of a police officer who has given a com-
pelled  statement, it does  impose on the prosecution  the substantial
burden of demonstrating that it has not made direct or indirect use of
the defendant officer's statement.  If investigators, prosecutors, or wit-
nesses have learned the contents of a compelled statement, that bur-
den  can  create  difficult  or  even  insurmountable  impediments  to
criminal prosecution.
Prosecutors have near-complete discretion to determine whether
and  when  a witness  who also  is  a  potential  defendant  will receive

541 (2001).
Although there are other legal responses to police criminality, such as the exclusion of
illegally obtained evidence from criminal trials, civil lawsuits, and federal "pattern or prac-
tice" lawsuits under the Police Accountability Act, 42 U.S.C. § 14141 (1994), they do not
sanction the suspect police officer.  Even if a civil lawsuit naming an individual police of-
ficer is successful, the officer's department usually will indemnify him.  See, e.g., Mary M.
Cheh, Are Lawsuits an Answer to Police Brutality?, in Police Violence 247, 268 (William
A. Geller & Hans Toch eds., 1996) ("[lIt is a rare case where an officer personally feels the
financial sting of a judgment....  As far as individual officers are concerned, monetary
awards to plaintiffs generally imply no real punishment .... ."). For a discussion of § 14141,
which permits the Department of Justice to seek injunctive relief against police depart-
ments, see 42 U.S.C. § 14141(b) (1994), and has led to consent decrees in Pittsburgh, Penn-
sylvania; Steubenville, Ohio; New Jersey; and Los Angeles, California; see generally Debra

benville consent decrees, and Marshall Miller, Note, Police Brutality, 17 Yale L. & Pol'y

court-ordered immunity.  Cognizant of the danger of tainting a later
prosecution, they exercise that discretion with considerable  care.  In
contrast, prosecutors do not control decisions to take or to dissemi-
nate compelled statements.  Internal affairs investigators make those
decisions, and thus inadvertently or intentionally can jeopardize crimi-
nal prosecutions of police officers.  In addition, police witnesses, who
may be reluctant to testify against colleagues, can avoid having to do
so by claiming to be tainted by a defendant officer's compelled state-
ment. Although prosecutors  can, and often do, employ prophylactic
measures to guard against some of the difficulties that Garrity immu-
nity creates,  those safeguards  are not entirely effective  and  can be
costly to criminal investigations.
The legal protection that police officers' compelled statements re-
ceive is extraordinary when considered in isolation.  When compared
to the protection that courts afford to coerced confessions, police im-
munity borders on absurd.  Simply put, courts place more stringent
restrictions on prosecutors' use of compelled statements that internal
affairs investigators take from police officers in noncustodial, nonco-
ercive settings than on their use of confessions that police extract from
in-custody suspects  by use of illegal physical force  or psychological
coercion.
Police criminality undermines the legitimacy of the nation's jus-
tice system.  Effective  punishment of officers who commit crimes  is
essential if we are to maintain public trust in that system.  Garrity
immunity jeopardizes that goal by creating tension between adminis-
trative and criminal investigations and impairing prosecutions of crim-
inal police officers.'1

issue with her proposed solution in Part M.B.1,  infra. Others have examined related is-
sues.  See, e.g., Robert M. Myers, Code of Silence:  Police Shootings and the Right to
Remain Silent, 26 Golden Gate U. L Rev. 497,523 (1996) (contending that police officers
involved in shootings can be required to provide written account without immunity or face
job loss); Byron L. Warnken, The Law Enforcement Officers' Privilege Against Compelled
Self-Incrimination, 16 U. Balt. L. Rev. 452, 515-16, 525-27 (1987)  (proposing comprehen-
sive police officers' "Bill of Rights" to include formal immunity grants or Miranda-type

Part I describes prevailing  doctrine-the treatment of police of-
ficers' compelled statements as immunized testimony.  It explains the
stringent restrictions  on prosecutorial  use  of immunized  testimony
and shows how those constraints  are particularly  troublesome when
applied to police officers'  compelled statements.  Part I also discusses
federal prosecutors'  attempts to limit the damage that Garrity immu-
nity can cause.
Part II explores the origin of the Garrity rule.  It notes that the
Garrity Court explained the suppression of compelled statements by
likening them to coerced confessions and characterizing the threat of
sanctions for refusal to answer questions as an "unconstitutional  con-
dition."  Part  II  demonstrates  that  both prongs  of this  explanation
were flawed and describes how the Court later shifted to a different
approach,  treating compelled statements  as immunized testimony.  It
also  shows how  this shift produced  a more robust and problematic
exclusionary rule.
Part III examines responses to the problems that Garrity immu-
nity creates.  First, it addresses the possibility of judicial abolition or
modification of the Garrity doctrine.  Next, it discusses statutory and
procedural  strategies  to  control  decisions  to  take  and  disseminate
compelled  statements.  Finally, it proposes that states and police de-
partments impose sanctions less severe than job loss when suspect po-
lice officers refuse to cooperate with internal affairs investigators. The
threat of lesser sanctions often will provide ample incentive for police
officers to answer investigators' questions and, at the same time, mini-
mize the risk that courts will prohibit use of the resulting statements in
criminal cases.

COMPELLED STATEMENTS AND  THE THREAT
TO POLICE PROSECUTIONS
A.  Compelled Statements and Garrity Immunity
Police departments routinely conduct noncriminal, administrative
investigations  into  allegations  of  police  misconduct  to  determine
whether discipline is warranted.12  As part of those investigations, in-
vestigators often  interview the suspect officer  or officers  along with
witness officers.13  In cases in which alleged misconduct may result in
12  See Warnken, supra note 11, at 453-57.
13  See Douglas W. Perez, Common Sense About Police Review 95 (1994)  (describing
internal investigation procedures); Levenson, supra note 7, at 536 ("It is standard proce-
dure for internal investigators to require the charged officers to provide a full statement
regarding their actions."); Douglas W. Perez & William Ker Muir, Administrative Review
HeinOnline -- 76 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 1314 2001

criminal charges, suspect officers have a valid basis for asserting their
Fifth Amendment privilege and refusing to answer questions on the
ground that their statements  may incriminate  them.14  To  promote
thorough investigations, and perhaps to avoid the unseemly spectacle
of officers refusing to cooperate with their own departments, regula-
tions, state statutes, and departmental  policies often require that po-
lice  officers,  whether  suspects  or  witnesses,  answer  questions  that
investigators pose.  Refusal to do so can result in discipline, including
job loss.15
In a series of cases decided from 1967 to 1977, the Supreme Court
confronted states' use of economic sanctions-job termination, loss of
pension benefits  or political  office, disbarment  from legal  practice,
of Alleged Police Brutality, in Police Violence, supra note 8, at 213, 215 (noting that, in
Oakland Police Department, "[o]fficers charged with misconduct and witness officers are
required to give truthful statements to the [Internal Affairs] section").  Investigation may
be conducted by an internal affairs unit of the police department, a civilian review board,
or both. See, e.g., U.S. Comm'n on Civil Rights, supra note 6, at ch. 4 (describing process
by which Civilian Complaint Review Board in New York City compels statements from
police officers named in citizen complaints).  In some systems, police have no obligation to
submit to civilian review board interviews.  Perez & Muir, supra, at 217.
14 The Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination,  made applicable  to the
states by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, see, for example, Malloy
v. Hogan, 378 U.S. 1, 8, 10-11 (1964), provides that: "No person... shall be compelled in
any criminal case to be a witness against himself .... "  U.S. Const. amend. V. The Su-
preme Court has interpreted the privilege as prohibiting the government from compelling
a statement that later could incriminate the declarant in a criminal prosecution.  See, e.g.,
Lefkowitz v. Turley, 414 U.S. 70,77 (1973)  ("The Amendment...  privileges [the individ-
ual] not to answer official questions put to him in any other proceeding, civil or criminal,
formal or informal, where the answers might incriminate him in future criminal proceed-
ings."). A person may assert the privilege whenever his statement "would furnish a link in
the chain of evidence needed to prosecute" him.  Hoffman v. United States, 341 U.S. 479,
486 (1951).
15 For example, the LAPD Manual provides that:
When police officers acquire knowledge of facts which will tend to incriminate
any person, it is their duty to disclose such facts to their superiors and to testify
freely concerning such facts when called upon to do so, even at the risk of self-
incrimination. It is a violation of duty for police officers to refuse to disclose
pertinent facts within their knowledge, and such neglect of duty can result in
disciplinary action up to and including termination.

Patrol Guide, Procedure 206-13 (Jan. 1, 2000)  (warning offiers that "if [they] refuse to

tom dictates, that the officer must cooperate during questioning or face possible adverse

and ineligibility for state contracts-to compel cooperation in criminal
and  noncriminal  investigations.16  In  all but one of these  "so-called
'penalty'  cases,"'7  public  employees  and  officials,  contractors,  and
others refused to waive immunity or answer questions and later con-
tested  the resulting  economic sanctions.  Garrity v.  New Jersey8  ar-
rived  in the Supreme  Court in  a different  posture.  In  Garrity, the
employees,  most of whom were  police  officers,  answered  the  ques-
tions,  thus  avoiding  the  threatened  economic  sanctions,  and  chal-
lenged  the  state's  subsequent  use  of  their  answers  in  criminal
prosecutions.19  Garrity, unlike the other penalty cases, presented the
question  whether compelled  statements  were  admissible in criminal
prosecutions.
Edward Garrity, the Chief of Police for the New Jersey Borough
of Bellmawr, other police officers, and a court clerk were suspected of
fixing traffic tickets.20  The Supreme Court of New Jersey ordered the
state  Attorney General to conduct an investigation  into the alleged
misconduct and report his findings.2'  A deputy attorney general ques-
tioned the suspects.22  A state statute required that they answer ques-
tions  or  lose  their  jobs  and  pensions.23  Before  conducting  the
interrogation, the deputy attorney general told each interviewee that

his answers could be used in state criminal proceedings and that "if he
refused to answer he would be subject to removal from office.'" 4 The
interviewees  answered  the  questions  posed to them.s  Later, local
prosecutors brought criminal charges26 and introduced into evidence
at trial the statements that the defendants  had made to the deputy
attorney general.27  After their convictions, the defendants appealed,
claiming that the use of their compelled statements violated their con-
stitutional fights.  New Jersey courts rejected those claims.2  But, in a
five-to-four  decision,  the  United  States  Supreme  Court  reversed,
holding the admission of the compelled statements unconstitutional2;9
The Court offered two explanations:  The statements were inadmissi-
ble  under the Due Process  Clause  as  coerced  confessions,  and  the
state's threat to fire the police officers unless they gave statements was
an unconstitutional condition.30
In a later case, the Court offered a different rationale for the re-
sult in Garrity:  The police officers' compelled statements were analo-
gous to immunized testimony and thus inadmissible under the Fifth
Amendment  privilege.31  Many  lower  courts  have  followed  suit,

general read to Garrity, see id. at 504 n.1 (Harlan, J., dissenting).

30 Id. at 497-98, 500. Inc ontrast, in cases in which states imposed sanctions for refusals
to answer questions or waive immunity, the Court determined that the privilege against
self-incrimination governed.  See, e.g., Uniformed Sanitation Men Ass'n, Inc. v. Comm'r of
Sanitation, 392 U.S. 280,284-85 (1968); Gardner v. Broderick, 392 U.S. 273,278-79 (1963);
Spevack v. Klein, 385 U.S. 511, 513-19 (1967).
31 See Lefkowitz v. Turley, 414 U.S. 70, 82 (1973)  ("It seems to us that the State in-
tended to accomplish what Garrity specifically prohibited-to compel testimony that had
not been immunized.").  Justice White, the author of that opinion, had first analogized
police officers' compelled statements to immunized testimony in his dissenting opinion in
Spevack v. Klein, 385 U.S. 511 (1967), the companion case to Garrity. Noting the Court's
decision in Murphy v. Waterfront Commission, 378 U.S. 52 (1964), which held that a state
grant of transactional immunity prevents federal prosecutors from using the immunized
testimony or its fruits, Murphy, 378 U.S. at 79, he argued that "[a] similar accommodation
should be made" when public officials  answer job-related questions under threat of dis-
charge. Spevak, 385 U.S. at 530-32 (White, J., dissenting).
Later Supreme Court opinions  also describe  Garrity as a case involving the Fifth
Amendment privilege or immunity. See, e.g., Pillsbury Co. v. Conboy, 459 U.S. 248,270
n.4 (1983) (Marshall, J.c,o ncurring) (describing forfeiture statute in Garrity as "allow[ing]
the authorities to compel a public officer, under threat of removal from office, to provide
incriminating testimony in exchange for immunity from use or derivative use of that testi-
mony at a criminal proceeding"); Kelley v.Jo hnson, 425 U.S. 238,248 (1976) ("Garriy,o  f

interrogation").  But see Lefkowitz v. Cunningham, 431 U.S. 801, 805 (1977)  (noting that
statements in Garrity "were made  involuntarily").  The Court never has  expressly dis-
avowed the rationales it provided in Garrity.
Although one can read Turley to require a formal immunity grant before a state can
compel a statement from an employee, see Turley, 414 U.S. at 70 ("States must offer to the
witness whatever immunity is required to supplant the privilege.  .. "), courts have deter-
mined that Garrity immunity attaches automatically when a police officer makes a state-
ment induced by threat of job loss, see infra note 43 and accompanying  text.

Imaged with the Permission of N.Y.U. Law ReviewNovember 2001] GARRITY IMMUNITY
The compelled statements in Garrity resembled formally immu-
nized testimony. When a witness before a court or a grand jury asserts
the privilege  against self-incrimination,  the prosecution can  compel
her testimony by securing an immunity grant?34  In Kastigarv . United
States,35 the  Court  held  that  "use  and  derivative  use"  immunity36
(often simply called "use immunity")37 is sufficient to require a wit-
ness to testify despite an assertion of the privilege.38  If an immunized
The Burger Court's Definition, 61 Minn. L. Rev. 383, 388-89 (1977)  (describing Garrit
,
protection as "informal use immunity").
34 18 U.S.C. §§ 6002-6003 (1994) establish the statutory basis for federal prosecutorial
authority to seek immunity grants.  Section 6002 provides that "no testimony or other in-
formation compelled under the [immunity] order (or any information directly or indirectly
derived from such testimony or other information) may be used against the witness in any
criminal case, except a prosecution for perjury, giving a false statement, or otherwise fail-
ing to comply with the order."  § 6002.  Although 21 U.S.C. contains an analogous immu-
nity provision for drug cases, see 21 U.S.C. § 884 (1994),  the Department of Justice relies
exclusively on the provisions in 18 U.S.C. See United States Attorneys' Manual § 9-23.100.
In order to immunize a witness, "a United States Attorney... must obtain approval
by the Attorney General or Deputy Attorney General and then request the court to order
the witness to testify."  United States v. Harvey, 869 F.2d 1439,  1450 (11th Cir. 19S9)
(Clark, J., dissenting); see also 18 U.S.C. § 6003(b) (1994)  (requiring approval from high-
level Department of Justice officials).  Courts must issue immunity orders upon receipt of a
proper application from the prosecution.  See 18 U.S.C. § 6003(a) (stating that court "shall
issue" immunity order upon proper request); Pillsbury Co., 459 U.S. at 254 n.11 (discussing
courts' "minor role" in immunity process).  Thus, in effect, prosecutors decide whether a
witness receives statutory immunity.
Federal  prosecutors  sometimes  circumvent  the  above-described  requirements  by
granting "informal" or "hip pocket" immunity-an agreement between the prosecutor and
the witness that the witness will provide information in exchange for a prosecutorial prom-
ise either to forego prosecution entirely or not to use the witness's testimony. See Haney,
869 F.2d at 1450-51.  This practice sometimes leaves the scope of the immunity unclear,
see, for example, United States v. Kilroy, 27 F.3d 679, 685 (D.C. Cir. 1994) (determining
meaning of term "use immunity" in agreement between prosecution and defendant), and
has drawn judicial ire, see, for example, United States v. Kilpatrick, 594 F. Supp. 1324 (D.
Colo. 1984) (holding grant of pocket immunity to have "violated the applicable statutes
and tainted  the grand jury indictment  with its illegality").  But  see United States v.
Kilpatrick, 821 F.2d 1456, 1470 & n.13 (10th Cir. 1987) (reversing district court's decision
to dismiss indictment based in part on taint caused by pocket immunity and noting that
"the use of 'informal immunity'... is entirely proper"), affd in part sub nom Bank of
Nova Scotia v. United States, 487 U.S. 250 (1988).
35 406 U.S. 441 (1972).
36 The phrase "use and derivative use" has been used synonymously with "direct and
indirect use," the terminology in the immunity statute. See Ronald F. Wright, Congres-
sional Use of Immunity Grants After Iran-Contra, 80 Minn. L  Rev. 407, 418-19 (1995).
37 See Kilroy, 27 F.3d  at 685  (describing  "common  understanding"  of term  "use
immunity").
38 Kastigar, 406 U.S. at 462 (holding that grant of use and derivative use immunity
"suffices to supplant" privilege).
Before Kastigar, a grant of transactional immunity, which precludes the prosecution
from bringing charges for any crime described in immunized testimony, was required to
supplant the privilege. See Counselman v. Hitchcock, 142 U.S. 547,586 (1892) ("In view of
the constitutional provision, a statutory enactment, to be valid, must afford absolute immu-

witness persists in her refusal to testify, she can be held in contempt.39
The immunized testimony is thus compelled by the contempt threat.
Use immunity does not foreclose  later criminal  charges against
the  witness  for  matters  described  in  the  immunized  testimony.
Rather, it prevents the prosecution from making use of the testimony
and any evidence derived therefrom against the witness in a criminal
trial.40  The Kastigar Court reasoned that a grant of such immunity is
coextensive with the Fifth Amendment because it leaves the witness-
turned-defendant "in substantially the same position as if the witness
had claimed the Fifth Amendment privilege"  and remained silent.41
The  Garrity protection operates in a similar manner-it enables
states to compel statements from public employees by threatening job
termination but bars use of the statements in later criminal prosecu-
tions.42  Accordingly,  when the deputy  attorney  general  threatened
Garrity and the others with loss of their jobs, he granted them de facto
use immunity in exchange for their answers.43  Although Garrity and
nity against future prosecution for the offence to which the question relates.").  In Murphy
v. Waterfront Commission, 378 U.S. 52 (1964), the Court suggested that use and derivative
use immunity might be sufficient to supplant the privilege and later settled the issue in
Kastigar.
Some have criticized the Court for allowing protection short of transactional immunity
to supplant the privilege, see, for example, Kastigar, 406 U.S. at 467-71  (Marshall, J.,di s-
senting); others have contended that by barring use of evidence derived from immunized
testimony, rather than just the testimony itself, Kastigarr equires too much, see Akhil Reed
Amar & Ren6e B. Lettow, Fifth Amendment First Principles:  The Self-Incrimination
Clause, 93  Mich. L. Rev.  857, 911  (1995)  ("The Kastigar rule ...should be trimmed
back .... Compelled  testimony should be excluded  from a criminal case .. but not
fruits.").
Some states continue to require transactional immunity to overcome the provisions in
their  constitutions  analogous  to  the  Fifth Amendment  privilege.  See,  e.g.,  State  v.
Gonzalez, 853 P.2d 526, 532-33 (Alaska 1993)  (construing state constitution  to require
transactional immunity in exchange for compelled testimony); State v. Miyasaki, 614 P.2d
915, 922-23 (Haw. 1980) (same); Attorney Gen. v. Colleton, 444 N.E.2d 915, 921  (Mass.
1982) (same); State v. Soriano, 684 P.2d 1220, 1232 (Or. Ct. App. 1984) (same).
39 See, e.g., United States v. Wilson, 421 U.S. 309, 314-16 & 315 n.7 (1975).
40 See Kastigar, 406 U.S. at 452-53.
41  Id. at 462; see also id. at 457 (holding that witness given use immunity was "in sub-
stantially the same position as if the witness had claimed his privilege in the absence of a
state grant of immunity" (quoting Murphy, 378 U.S. at 79)).
42 See, e.g., Minnesota v. Murphy, 465 U.S. 420, 436 n.7 (1984) ("Our cases indicate ...
that a State may validly insist on answers [from public employees and others]  to even
incriminating questions...  as long as it recognizes that the required answers may not be
used in a criminal proceeding and thus eliminates the threat of incrimination.").
43 See, e.g., Hester  v. City of Milledgeville,  777 F.2d 1492,  1496  (11th  Cir. 1985)
(describing Garrity as requiring "a form of use immunity which, absent waiver, automati-
cally  attaches  to compelled  incriminating statements  as a  matter of law").  Professor
Warnken takes issue with this interpretation of Garrity. He maintains that Garrity and its
progeny do not provide for a self-executing form of immunity. Warmken, supra note 11, at
486-88.  He contends that in order for a police department to compel answers under threat
HeinOnline -- 76 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 1320 2001
Imaged with the Permission of N.Y.U. Law ReviewNovember 2001] GARRITY IMMUNITY
the others did not first assert the privilege, an action typically required
to trigger its protection,44 the Court since  has concluded that when
assertion itself would be penalized, as was the case in Garrity, the pro-
tection is self-executing.45
B.  The Significance of the Immunized Testimony Analogy
1.  Restrictions on ProsecutorialU  se of Immunized Testimony
Courts' treatment of police officers' compelled statements as "im-
munized" is significant because of the stringent restrictions that courts
impose on prosecutorial use of such testimony.  As noted above, the
prosecution  cannot introduce immunized  testimony or any evidence
derived therefrom in its case-in-chief,46 nor can it use immunized testi-
mony to impeach the person who gave it47.
There are important additional limitations on the use of formally
immunized  testimony.  First, relying on Kastigar's command  that a
grant of use immunity "prohibits the prosecutorial  authorities from
using the compelled testimony in any respect,"48  and its conclusion
that immunity "therefore insures that the testimony cannot lead to the
infliction of criminal penalties on the witness,"49 a number of courts
prohibit prosecutors from making "nonevidentiary  use" of a criminal
of job loss, it must grant formal immunity or, at the minimum, give the officer Miranda-like
warnings, including an assurance that any statements are immunized.  Id. at 48248. Al-
though language in both Lefkowitz v. Turley, 414 U.S. 70, 85 (1973),  and Lefkowitz v.
Cunningham, 431 U.S. 801, 809 (1977), suggests that a formal immunity grant may be nec-
essary, Warnken concedes that courts have decided otherwise, treating Garrity immunity
as self-executing without warnings.  Warnken, supra note 11, at 488.
44 See, e.g., Murphy, 465 U.S. at 429 ("[A] witness confronted with questions that the
government should reasonably expect to elicit incriminating evidence ordinarily must as-
sert the privilege rather than answer if he desires not to incriminate himself."); United
States v. Kordel, 397 U.S. 1, 10 (1970) (holding that failure of corporate officer who an-
swered interrogatories "to assert the constitutional privilege leaves him in no position to
complain now that he was compelled to give testimony against himself").
45 See Murphy, 465 U.S. at 434-35 (noting that express or implied threat that invocation
of privilege will result in penalty, as was case in Garrity, excuses failure to assert privilege).
46 See, e.g., United States v. Hubbell, 530 U.S. 27,38 (2000) (noting that Fifth Amend-
ment protects "against the prosecution's use of incriminating information derived directly
or indirectly from the compelled testimony"); Kastigar, 406 U.S. at 453 (holding that im-
munity that prohibits "the use of compelled testimony, as well as evidence derived directly
and indirectly therefrom" affords sufficient protection to supplant privilege).  If a portion
of a witness's immunized testimony is materially false, both his false testimony and his
truthful testimony are admissible in a perjury prosecution. See United States v. Apfelbam,
445 U.S. 115, 130-32 (1980).
47 See New Jersey v. Portash, 440 U.S. 450 (1979).

(8th Cir. 1973) ("[Ilf the immunity protection is to be coextensive with the Fifth Amend-

that which results in the presentation  of evidence  before the jury.");  United States v.
Harris, 780 F. Supp. 385, 390 (N.D. W. Va. 1991)  (holding that "no use whatsoever" can be
made of immunized statements); People v. Gwillim, 274 Cal. Rptr. 415, 426 (Cal. Ct. App.
1990) ("The  district attorney ...  may not use defendant's [compelled]  statement to ad-

719, 724-25 (Minn. 1996) (following McDaniel and holding that privilege prohibits nonevi-
dentiary use of compelled statements); State v. Irizarry, 639 A.2d 305, 310 n.1 (N.J. Super.
Ct. App. Div. 1994) (interpreting New Jersey Supreme Court precedent as prohibiting non-
evidentiary uses).
Some courts have rejected the notion that the Fifth Amendment bars nonevidentiary
uses.  See, e.g., United States v. Bolton, 977 F.2d 1196, 1199 (7th Cir. 1992) (holding that
"tangential" effect of immunized testimony on prosecutor's thought process not prohib-
ited); United States v. Byrd, 765 F.2d 1524, 1531 (11th Cir. 1985)  ("It is our view that the
privilege against self-incrimination is concerned with direct and indirect evidentiary uses of
compelled testimony, and not with the exercise of prosecutorial discretion.").  Other courts
have yet to decide the issue.  See, e.g., United States v. Kilroy, 27 F.3d 679, 687 (D.C. Cir.
1994) (assuming, without deciding, that nonevidentiary use is prohibited); United States v.
Serrano, 870 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 1989) (rejecting notion that "all nonevidentiary use neces-
sarily violates the Fifth Amendment" but leaving open possibility that some such uses may
require dismissal of indictment).  There appears to be a difference of opinion among Ninth
Circuit panels about the status of nonevidentiary uses.  Compare United States v. Mapelli,
971 F.2d 284, 287 (9th Cir. 1992) (citing McDaniel, 482 F.2d at 311, to support proposition
that prosecutors may not use immunized  testimony  to plan trial strategy),  with United
States v. Montoya, 45 F.3d 1286 (9th Cir. 1995)  (assuming that Fifth Amendment  bars
some nonevidentiary uses but noting that circuit has not yet decided and concluding that

Second, in United States v. North,53 the Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia, also  relying on the above-quoted  language in
Kastigar,h eld that the privilege bars the prosecution from making "in-
direct evidentiary use" of immunized  testimony by calling witnesses
whose testimony has been shaped, altered, or affected by the defen-
dant's earlier immunized testimony.54  In "the most expansive reading
of the Fifth Amendment to date regarding the evidentiary use of im-
munized testimony, 55 North prohibited admission of testimony from
witnesses who had employed a criminal defendant's previously given
immunized testimony "to refresh their memories, or otherwise to fo-
cus their thoughts, organize their testimony, or alter their prior or con-

Kate E. Bloch, Fifth Amendment Compelled Statements: Modeling the Contours of 'Their
Protected Scope, 72 Wash. U. LQ. 1603, 1605 n.14 (1994)  (arguing that line between evi-
dentiary and nonevidentiary uses "remains to be clearly drawn"); Turner, supra note 50, at
130 (concluding that "a nonevidentiary use is really an indirect evidentiary use that is yet
to be proven").  Courts sometimes differ on whether uses are "evidentiary" or "noneviden-
tiary."  Compare Semkiw, 712 F.2d at 895 (adopting McDaniel definition of nonevidentiary
use to include "planning cross-examination"), with Byrd, 765 F.2d at 1531 (holding that
prosecutor's use of knowledge of immunized testimony to elicit answers on cross-examina-
tion probably would constitute evidentiary use).

immunized testimony "may help explicate evidence theretofore unintelligible, and it may

helpful in developing opening and closing arguments").

2.  The Prosecution'sB  urden
Restrictions  on the use  of immunized  testimony do more than
limit the prosecution's arsenal.  If a particular use is prohibited, the
prosecution bears  the burden of demonstrating  that it has not em-
ployed the defendant's previously given immunized testimony in that
manner.58  The more uses prohibited,  the greater the burden on the
prosecution  to demonstrate  that its presentation  of the  case  is un-
tainted.59  Kastigar describes  this "heavy  burden"60  in no uncertain
terms:  "This burden of proof, which we reaffirm as appropriate, is not
56  North I, 910 F.2d at 860.  Before North, Professor Strachan had suggested that such
use of immunized testimony might run afoul of the Fifth Amendment. See Strachan, supra
note 50, at 817 (noting possibility that witnesses who saw immunized testimony "would
shape their testimony as a result of knowledge of... immunized testimony").
57 See United States v. Schmidgall, 25 F.3d 1523, 1528 (11th Cir. 1994) ("The protection
against self-incrimination is violated whenever the prosecution presents a witness whose
testimony is shaped-directly  or indirectly-by immunized testimony ...  ."); People v.
Reali, 895 P.2d 161, 166 (Colo. Ct. App. 1994)  (citing North for proposition that "to the
extent that another person has been exposed to the immunized testimony, the testimony of
that other person may be so 'tainted' that it would be a violation of the defendant's rights
to make use of that person's testimony"); State v. Vallejos, 883 P.2d 1269, 1276-78 (N.M.
1994) (applying North to reverse murder conviction when prosecution called witness whose
trial testimony appeared to have been altered by defendant's immunized testimony).  The
Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has rejected North, holding instead that the prose-
cution can call a witness whose testimony may have been affected by a defendant's testi-
mony so long as the witness has a source for the information in his testimony  that is
independent of the immunized testimony.  See United States v. Koon, 34 F.3d 1416, 1431-
33 (9th Cir. 1994), rev'd on other grounds, 518 U.S. 81 (1996).
Some courts have determined that Kastigar also prohibits prosecutors from calling a
witness if the prosecution used the defendant's previously given immunized testimony to
indict the witness and secure his cooperation.  See, e.g., United States v. Hampton, 775
F.2d 1479, 1488-89 (11th Cir. 1985) (holding that if defendant's immunized testimony or its
fruits contributed directly or indirectly to case against witness, witness's testimony was not
allowed); United States v. Kurzer, 534 F.2d 511, 517-18 (2d Cir. 1976) (remanding for de.
termination of whether immunized testimony was used or relied on in negotiations leading
to witness's cooperation).
58 See Kastigar,4 06 U.S. at 460-62 (describing prosecution's burden).
59 Courts have rejected speculative claims of taint involving convoluted theories of cau-
sation.  See, e.g., United States v. Kilroy, 27 F.3d 679, 681-82, 687 (D.C. Cir. 1994)  (re-
jecting defendant's  immunity  claim based  on allegation  that retroactively  immunized
statements given in connection with unrelated out-of-state investigation led to brief news-
paper article that may have prompted private audit of pension plan that defendant had
defrauded when audit led to referral of case for prosecution and then to charges that de-
fendant challenged as tainted); Helmsley, 941 F.2d at 76-78 (rejecting defendant's chal-
lenge based on claim that her immunized testimony before state grand jury on unrelated
matter prompted New York  7mes story that caused New York Post reporter to reopen
inquiry that triggered state and federal tax fraud investigations that ultimately led to fed-
eral indictment).

limited to a negation of taint; rather, it imposes on the prosecution the
affirmative duty to prove that the evidence it proposes to use is de-
rived from a legitimate source wholly independent of the compelled
testimony.'61  Mere denials of use of immunized testimony often are
inadequate to satisfy the burden.62  If the prosecution fails to demon-
strate affirmatively that its case is untainted by a defendant's immu-
nized  testimony, it  may  suffer  dismissal  or  suppression  of critical
evidence, even if it has not made use of the testimony.63  All that a
witness-turned-defendant  need do to benefit from this "very substan-
61  Id. at 460.  Despite the Court's description of the burden as "heavy," some courts
require that the prosecution prove by only a "preponderance of the evidence" that its case
is untainted.  See, e.g., Schmidgall, 25 F.3d at 1528; United States v. Byrd, 765 F.2d 1524,
1529 (11th Cir. 1985).  Courts reason that the burden nonetheless remains "heavy" because
the prosecution suffers exclusion of evidence if it fails to meet the burden.  See United
States v. Montoya, 45 F.3d 1286,1292 n.6 (9th Cir. 1995) (quoting North 1, 910 F.2d at 873).
If a hearing is necessary to resolve such a claim, "a trial court may hold ...  pre-trial, post-
trial, [or] mid-trial [hearings] (as evidence is offered), or it may employ some combination
of these methods.  A pre-trial hearing is the most common choice."  North I, 910 F.2d at
854. For a discussion of the types of hearings used and the standard of proof the prosecu-
tion must satisfy, see, for example, Wright, supra note 36, at 419-21; Murphy, supra note 53,
at 1023-27.
62 Hampton, 775 F.2d at 1485.
63 See, e.g., Braswell v. United States, 487 U.S. 99, 117 (1988) ("Even in cases where
the government does not employ the immunized  testimony for any purpose--direct  or
derivative-against the witness, the Government's inability to meet the 'heavy burden' it
bears may result in preclusion of crucial evidence that was obtained legitimately.").
The remedies for the prosecution's failure to satisfy Kastigard iffer, depending on the
nature of the alleged use.  If the prosecution cannot disprove a claim that a defendant's
previously given immunized testimony shaped a witness's testimony or recollection,  the
appropriate remedy is the suppression of that witness's testimony at trial.  See, e.g., People
v. Reali, 895 P.2d 161, 166 (Colo. Ct. App. 1994) (holding that prosecution cannot use
testimony of tainted witness); State v. Gault, 551 N.W.2d 719, 724-25  (Minn. Ct. App.
1996) (upholding suppression of tainted witness testimony). Arguably, the same result will
follow if the prosecution cannot disprove that the immunized testimony led it to a witness
or motivated a witness to testify against the defendant.  CE United States v. Ceccolini, 435
U.S. 268,278-79 (1978) (assuming that absent attenuation, testimony of witness discovered
by exploitation of illegally seized evidence must be excluded).  But see United States v.
Kurzer, 534 F.2d 511, 514 (2d Cir. 1976) (reviewing lower court's order dismissing indict-
ment based on finding that grand jury witness was motivated to testify by defendant's ear-
lier immunized testimony); People v. Gwillim, 274 Cal. Rptr. 415, 427-28 (Cal. CL. App.
1990)  (assuming that if compelled statement motivated essential prosecution witness to
press charges, remedy would be dismissal).
In most jurisdictions, mere exposure to immunized testimony does not disqualify a
prosecutor from working on a case. See, e.g., United States v. Palumbo, 897 F.2d 245,251
(7th Cir. 1990).  But, if the prosecutor is unable to prove her ability to make strategic and
tactical decisions free of her knowledge of the immunized testimony, the court may require
disqualification. See, e.g., United States v. Mapelli, 971 F.2d 284,288 (9th Cir. 1992) (hold-
ing that prosecutor should have been disqualified where "[t]he government offered no evi-
dence whatsoever that it would not use [immunized] information").  Courts are reluctant
to require dismissal when the decision to prosecute may have been influenced by immu-
nized testimony. See Montoya, 45 F.3d at 1295-97 (rejecting as "too remote" defendant's
contention that decision to prosecute him was based on prosecutor's assessment that he

tial protection" is demonstrate that he has testified  under a grant of
immunity about matters related to the prosecution.64
This robust exclusionary rule creates substantial risks when pros-
ecutors bring charges against previously immunized witnesses.63  The
prosecution can satisfy its burden by showing that witnesses, investiga-
tors, and prosecutors have not been exposed to the immunized testi-
mony, either directly by reading it, or indirectly by otherwise learning
of it.66  But if there has been exposure,  the prosecution can prevail
only if it can establish that exposed witnesses, investigators, or prose-
cutors have not been "tainted"  by the immunized  testimony.67  This
gave false immunized testimony); Byrd, 765 F.2d at 1530 (declining to inquire into prosecu-
tor's motive to indict).
There is a split in authority whether derivative use of a defendant's immunized testi-
mony before a grand jury requires dismissal of the indictment.  Compare United States v.
Rivieccio, 919 F.2d 812, 816 (2d Cir. 1990) (holding that derivative use of immunized testi-
mony before grand jury does not require dismissal of indictment; appropriate remedy is
suppression  at trial), with North 1, 910 F.2d at 869 (finding that when "the grand jury
process itself is violated and corrupted," then "the indictment becomes indistinguishable
from the constitutional ...  transgression"), and North II, 920 F.2d at 947-49 (holding that
indirect evidentiary use of defendant's previously given immunized testimony before grand
jury that returns indictment requires dismissal).  Some jurisdictions carve out two "narrow
exceptions" when dismissal is required:  (1) "when the defendant testifies under immunity
before the same grand jury returning the indictment or when the immunized testimony is
placed before the indicting grand jury"; and (2) "when the government concedes that the
indictment rests almost exclusively on tainted evidence."  Rivieccio, 919 F.2d at 816 n.4,
But see United States v. Zielezinski, 740 F.2d 727, 729 (9th Cir. 1984) (rejecting view that
indictment returned by grand jury that heard defendant's immunized testimony must be
dismissed).
64 Kastigar, 406 U.S. at 461-62 ("One raising a claim under this [immunity] statute need
only show that he testified under a grant of immunity in order to shift to the government
the heavy burden of proving that all of the evidence it proposes to use was derived from
legitimate independent sources.").
65  See, e.g., Braswell, 487 U.S. at 117 n.10 (recognizing that "the burden of proving an
independent source that a grant of immunity places on the Government" could have "a
deleterious effect on law enforcement efforts").
66 See, e.g., Mapelli, 971 F.2d at 287-88 (finding that assignment of case to unexposed
prosecutor defeats Kastigar claim); North 1, 910 F.2d at 872 (holding that prosecution can
meet Kastigar burden by showing "that the witness was never exposed to North's immu-
nized testimony").
67  Most courts have determined that exposure to immunized testimony alone does not
necessarily taint either a prosecutor or a witness.  See, e.g., North 11, 920 F.2d at 944
("Some [witnesses] might convincingly testify that their exposure had no effect on their
trial or grand jury testimony."); Palumbo, 897 F.2d at 251 (refusing to disqualify exposed
prosecutor even though "it may be wise for the government to ask another attorney to take
over this case"; prosecution might be able to prove all evidence used in future was derived
from independent sources); United States v. Serrano, 870 F.2d 1, 17-18 (1st Cir. 1988) (re-
jecting view that prosecutor's exposure to immunized testimony necessarily taints her and
results in nonevidentiary use); United States v. Pantone, 634 F.2d 716, 720 (3d Cir. 1980)
("We do not believe that mere access to immunized grand jury testimony prevents the
government  from carrying its burden under Kastigar."); Gwillim, 274 Cal. Rptr. at 425

requires  a showing that the immunized testimony has not shaped or
affected  a  witness's  testimony  or  influenced  investigative  or
prosecutorial decisions in the case.
C.  "Garrity Immunity" and Threats to Police Prosecutions
Despite their use of the term "immunized" to describe police of-
ficers'  compelled  statements, courts  need not vest those statements
with the full measure of protection they bestow on formally immu-
nized testimony.68  Nonetheless, appellate courts that have considered
the matter have concluded that the scope of Garrity immunity is com-
mensurate with that of formally immunized testimony, signaling that
the use restrictions applicable to immunized testimony and compelled
statements are the same.69  But circumstances surrounding immunity
ness's testimony."); see also Turner, supra note 50, at 128 ("The courts of appeals agree
that a prosecutor's mere knowledge of immunized testimony does not bar prosecution for
crimes to which the compelled testimony relates.").  But see United States v. McDaniel,
482 F.2d 305, 311-12 (8th Cir. 1973) (finding that when prosecutor read immunized testi-
mony in early stages of investigation, was then unaware that testimony had been immu-
nized, and made no efforts to segregate information learned from immunized testimony,
"although [the prosecutor] asserts that he did not use [the immunized]  testimony in any
form, we cannot escape the conclusion that the testimony could not be wholly obliterated
from the prosecutor's mind in his preparation and trial of this case"); State v. Gonzalez,
853 P.2d 526,531 (Alaska 1993) (rejecting view that "procedures exist to probe the mind of
a witness" to determine extent to which exposure resulted in taint of testimony).
Even if a witness, investigator, or prosecutor claims that exposure did not prevent him
from giving untainted testimony or making decisions independent of the immunized testi-
mony, a court may find those claims unpersuasive.  See United States v. Schmidgall, 25
F.3d 1523, 1529 (11th Cir. 1994) (noting that uncorroborated testimony from agent "would
not generally be sufficient to carry the burden"); United States v. Harris, 790 F. Supp. 385,
391-93 (N.D.W. Va. 1991) (holding that when prosecutor took immunized statement from
witness and had copy of immunized statement in file, his testimony that he had forgotten
interview and was unaware of statement in file was insufficient to satisfy Kastigar).
68 See infra Part III.A.2 (arguing that courts should relax prohibitions on some uses of
police officers' compelled statements); see also Bloch, supra note 11, at 638-39 ("Precisely
what 'exempt from use' meant [in Garrity] or means today is both complex and open to
debate.").
69  See United States v. Veal, 153 F.3d 1233, 1240 n.7 (11th Cir. 1998) ("We can analo-
gize between the scope of the federal use immunity statute..,  and Garrity analysis under
the Fifth Amendment because our court has held that a Garrity-protected  statement is
tantamount to use immunity."); Kinamon v. United States (In re Grand Jury Proceedings),
45 F.3d 343, 347 (9th Cir. 1995)  (treating compelled statement as equivalent of formally
immunized testimony); United States v. Koon, 34 F.3d 1416, 1431 n.11 (9th Cir. 1994) (not-
ing that despite government concern about applying immunity doctrine to police officers'
compelled statements, "[b]ecause the use of compelled testimony in the Garrity context
also directly implicates the individual's Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination,
Kastigar'sd iscussion of the scope of the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimina-
tion is directly relevant  in the Garrity context"),  rev'd on other grounds, 518 U.S.  81

much protection as some other appellate courts.  See supra note 57 (describing Koon
court's rejection of North rule).

grants are very different from those surrounding a police department's
acquisition of compelled statements.  Those differences make the use
restrictions considerably  more troublesome in prosecutions of police
officers for a number of reasons.
First, Garrity immunity is likely to plague prosecutions of police
officers far more often than analogous immunity issues will surface in
other sorts of prosecutions.  Prosecutors seldom grant formal immu-
nity70  and  almost  never  immunize  witnesses  whom  they  may later
prosecute.71  In contrast,  some police  departments routinely compel
statements  from both officers suspected  of potentially  criminal mis-
conduct  and police witnesses  to alleged  misconduct,  who later may
become  suspects.  If sufficient  evidence  exists to prosecute  a police
officer  from such a  department,  the chances  are good  that internal
affairs investigators have started  an administrative investigation  and
have compelled  a statement.72
70 For example, in 1998, federal prosecutors in the U.S. Attorneys' Offices and the
Criminal Division of the Department of Justice requested departmental approval to seek
immunity for only 1616 witnesses.  Sourcebook of Criminal Justice Statistics 1999, at 396
tbl.5.1 (Ann L. Pastore & Kathleen Maguire eds., 1999).  The same year, the Department
prosecuted 69,769 defendants.  Id. at 419 tbl.5.21.  It is worth noting that it is unclear how
many witnesses actually received immunity from federal prosecutors.  On one hand, prose-
cutors may request authorization from the Department but never apply for or use an im-
munity grant.  On the other, the number of requests for authorization does not reflect the
use  of  informal  immunity  agreements.  See  supra  note  34  (describing  hip-pocket
immunity).
71  See Pillsbury Co. v. Conboy, 459 U.S. 248, 288 & n.8 (1983)  (Stevens, J., dissenting)
("[In almost all cases, an offer of immunity-even of use immunity-means sacrificing the
chance to prosecute the witness for his own role in the criminal enterprise.").  Although I
am not aware of any statistics on this point, after a decade of service as an Assistant U.S.
Attorney in the Central District of California and the Northern District of New York,
which included several supervisory positions, I cannot recall a case in which a previously
immunized witness was prosecuted for matters described in his testimony.  The Depart-
ment of Justice imposes a stringent approval requirement for such prosecutions.  See U.S.
Attorneys' Manual § 9-23.400 (requiring Attorney General to approve prosecution after
compulsion).
72 See, e.g., Indep. Comm'n on the L.A. Police Dep't, Report of the Independent Com-
mission on the Los Angeles Police  Department 161-62  (1991)  [hereinafter Christopher
Comm'n Report] (describing routine LAPD practice of taking compelled statements  in
police shooting investigations despite adverse impact on criminal prosecutions); Perez &
Muir, supra note 13, at 215 (describing routine practice of taking compelled statements in
Oakland); id. at 217 (noting that civilian police review commission in Berkeley takes com-
pelled statements); Warnken, supra note 11, at 456-57 (describing routine practice of com-
pelled  questioning of police  officers  suspected  of misconduct).  But see  L.A. County
Sheriff's Dep't, Report by Special Counsel James G. Kolts & Staff 149 (1992) [hereinafter

Second, prosecutors can better avoid problems arising from im-
munized testimony than from compelled statements.  Prosecutors usu-
ally control whether a court will grant formal inununity.73  As a result,
they can refrain from seeking immunity if later prosecution of the wit-
ness is a possibility.  In contrast, prosecutors are powerless to prevent
internal affairs investigators from "immunizing" suspect officers.
Third, even when an immunity grant is unavoidable, prosecutors
have greater ability to minimize potential hazards than when police
investigators compel statements.  If it is necessary to immunize a wit-
ness who likely will be prosecuted, prosecutors  may be able to post-
pone the immunity grant until after prosecution, eliminating Kastigar
73 Other governmental actors, such as prosecutors from other jurisdictions and legisla-
tive bodies, can secure judicially ordered grants of immunity without a prosecutor's con-
sent. See, e.g., United States v. Serrano, 870 F.2d 1, 13 (1st Cir. 1989) (involving defendant
immunized by Puerto Rican House of Representatives  and later prosecuted by federal
government); United States v. First W. State Bank of Minot, 491 F2d 780, 782 (8th Cir.
1974)  (involving state grant of immunity and federal prosecution); see also North 1, 910
F.2d at 851 (involving federal prosecution following congressional grant of immunity pur-
suant to 18 U.S.C. § 6005 (1988)).  One federal court has held that, in some circumstances,
a trial court can immunize a witness without a request from the prosecution.  See Virgin
Islands v. Smith, 615 F.2d 964, 973-74 (3d Cir. 1980) ("[Iln cases where the government can
present no strong countervailing interest, a court has inherent authority to immunize a
witness .... ").  But see United States v. Turkish,  623 F.2d 769, 771-78 (2d Cir. 1980)
(criticizing doctrine of "judicial immunity" and noting widespread rejection of doctrine by
courts, despite academic endorsement).  Although immunity that other actors confer can
impair a prosecutor's efforts to later prosecute the immunized witness, that threat is less
troubling than Garrity immunity for several reasons.
First, it is uncommon for either prosecutors or other investigative bodies to grant im-
munity. For example, in fiscal year 1992, Congress sought immunity for only one  itness,
and federal agencies sought immunity for only 198 witnesses.  See Wright, supra note 36, at
427 n.91.  It is unlikely that more than a small fraction of those witnesses, if any, were later
prosecuted for matters described in their testimony.
Second, because prosecutors' offices share the common objective of effective law en-
forcement, they likely will exercise caution before immunizing witnesses subject to possible
prosecution elsewhere.  For example, federal prosecutors must inform the Department of
Justice of any opposition by state or local prosecutors when seeking authorization to re-
quest that a court order immunity. See U.S. Attorneys' Manual § 9-23.130;  U.S. Attor-
neys'  Criminal  Resource  Manual  § 721  (1997),  http://hvww.usdoj.gov/usaoleousal
foiajreading-roomusam/tifte9/rmOO721.htm.  Likewise, Congress has exhibited a willing-
ness to forgo immunity grants that may impair criminal investigations.  See Wright, supra
note 36, at 429-35 (noting that "Congress has been stingy with grants of immunity over the
last twenty-five years," and that results in North and in United States v. Poindexter, 698 F.
Supp. 300 (D.D.C. 1988), rev'd 951 F.2d 369 (D.C. Cir. 1991), cert. denied 506 U.S. 1021
(1992), have discouraged congressional use of immunity).  Even if a prosecutor or another
entity does grant immunity despite another prosecutor's interest in a later prosecution of
the witness, the immunizing agency can prevent harm by limiting dissemination of the im-
munized testimony.
Third, prosecutors from other jurisdictions and legislators are likely to be more ac-
countable to the electorate for decisions to grant immunity than police internal affairs units
are for their decisions to compel statements and thus confer Garrity immunity.

problems.74  If it is impracticable to prosecute before granting immu-
nity, the prosecution can delay the immunity grant to provide time to
implement measures to reduce the possibility of taint and marshal evi-
dence to prove at a Kastigar hearing that its evidence is untainted.75
For example, before granting immunity, the prosecution can pre-
serve  (or  "can")  statements  from  witnesses  who  may  later  testify
against the soon-to-be-immunized  potential defendant.76  If the prose-
cution later brings charges against the immunized witness, it can rebut
a claim  that its evidence has been  derived from the witness-turned-
defendant's immunized testimony by demonstrating  that it gathered
the evidence before the immunity grant.  If the witness-turned-defen-
dant claims that the immunized testimony has affected the testimony
of prosecution witnesses,  comparison  of preimmunity  canned  state-
ments  to  postimmunity  challenged  testimony  can  disprove  that
77
claim.
74 See United States Attorney's Manual § 9-23.212 ("It is preferable as a matter of
policy to punish offenders for their criminal conduct prior to compelling them to testify.").
Preimmunity prosecution solves immunity-related  problems in two ways.  First, it enables
prosecutors to secure a taint-free conviction before granting immunity.  Second, a final
conviction  and  sentence,  or  an  acquittal,  extinguishes  the  defendant-witness's  Fifth
Amendment rights with respect to the charges that are the subject of the disposition. See,
e.g., Mitchell v. United States, 526 U.S. 314, 315 (1999)  (holding that privilege survives
until sentencing); Ibarra v. Martin, 143 F.3d 286, 288-89 (7th Cir. 1998) (finding no privi-
lege after acquittal).
75  See Keenan, supra note 50, at 187 ("[I]n all but the most exceptional cases, the gov-
ernment is, prior to granting immunity, in a unique position to evaluate any possible [Kasti-
gar] proof problems and take the necessary prophylactic measures to insure that its burden
can be met.").
76 "Canning" is the process by which the prosecutor seals and files or otherwise docu-
ments and preserves preimmunity testimony and other evidence.  See North I, 910 F.2d at
871 (describing "canning"  as sealing and filing evidence and prosecution theories); U.S.
Attorneys'  Criminal  Resource  Manual,  § 726  (1997),  http:llwww.usdoj.gov/usao/eousa/
foiajreading-room/usam/title/crm00726.htm  (recommending steps to avoid taint); Turner,
supra note 50, at 114 (describing "canning").  A common method of "canning" is to ques-
tion the witness before a grand jury.
77 See, e.g., United States v. Koon, 34 F.3d 1416, 1433 n.13 (9th Cir. 1994) ("The pro-
cess of formal  grants of immunity .. provides time for the prosecutor to protect  the
testimony of potential witnesses by obtaining canned statements  and by shielding these
witnesses from exposure to the immunized testimony." (citation omitted)), rev'd on other
grounds, 518 U.S. 81 (1996); see also North I, 910 F.2d at 872-73 (holding that prosecution
can meet burden by establishing "that the allegedly tainted testimony contains no evidence
not 'canned'  by the prosecution before such exposure occurred"); North H, 920 F.2d 940,
943 (D.C. Cir. 1990) ("[I]f such steps are not taken, it may well be extremely difficult for
the prosecutor to sustain its burden of proof that a witness exposed to immunized testi-
mony has not shaped his or her testimony in light of the exposure .... ).
Canning witness testimony does not guarantee that the witnesses will escape later ex-
posure to, or be untainted by, immunized testimony. It merely creates a record of what the
witness knew and remembered before exposure.  If the witness gives substantially identical
testimony after  exposure, it should satisfy the prosecution's burden of proving that the
immunized testimony did not shape the witness testimony. See North 1, 910 F.2d at 872-73.

In contrast, prosecutors are unable to dictate the timing of police
officers'  compelled  statements.  Internal  affairs investigators  decide
when to take compelled statements and may do so without consider-
ing the potential fallout from Garrity immunity.  Indeed, they often
compel statements at the outset of an investigation, foreclosing oppor-
tunities for preimmunity prosecution or evidence gathering.78
Fourth, prosecutors  are more likely to be forewarned  of previ-
ously immunized testimony by a potential defendant than of a com-
pelled  statement  by  a  police  officer.  Advance  notice  provides  an
opportunity to minimize  exposure.  In many cases,  the prosecutor's
office that is considering charges against a defendant will have been
involved  in, and thus will be aware  of, an earlier decision  to grant
immunity.  Even if a different prosecutor's  office or another govern-
mental entity granted immunity,79 the formal process surrounding im-
munity grants80  may give the charging prosecutor adequate notice.81
Alerted to a possible Kastigarc hallenge, prosecutors can take precau-
tionary measures.  For example, if a transcript of a potential defen-
dant's testimony from an earlier proceeding exists, the prosecutor's
office can ensure that the prosecutors  and investigators  assigned to
the case do not read it, enhancing the chances of later proving that the
If a witness whose testimony has been canned changes his testimony after exposure, can-
ning may be insufficient to satisfy the Kastigar burden in a jurisdiction that follows the
North rule prohibiting witness testimony shaped by immunized testimony.
Although it may be possible to prove that testimony from a witness who was exposed
to a compelled statement is untainted even in the absence of canned testimony, see North
11, 920 F.2d at 944 (suggesting that witnesses "might convincingly testify that their expo-
sure had no effect on their trial  or grand jury testimony"),  that method of satisfying
Kastigari s of little use if the witness is uncooperative. See infra notes 97-101 and accompa-
nying text (describing police officers' reluctance to testify against fellow officers).
78 See Koon, 34 F.3d at 1433 n.13 (
[T]he individuals who question the employee are concerned about potential
misconduct,  and their goal is generally to learn the facts of a situation as
quickly as possible. They do not necessarily act with the care and precision of
a prosecutor weighing the benefits of compelling testimony against the risks to
future prosecutions; indeed, they may not even have the prospect of prosecu-
tion and the requirements of the Fifth Amendment in mind.).
Internal investigators may take a statement before the local district attorney is aware of
potential criminal conduct.  Some police departments postpone efforts to take a compelled
statement until after completion of any criminal investigation.  Supra note 72 (describing
policy in some police departments of postponing compelled statements).
79 See supra  note 73 (describing immunity  grants by government actors other than
prosecutor's office that brings charges).
8o  See supra note 34 (describing formal process).
81  Sometimes formal immunity catches prosecutors unaware. See, e.g.,  United States v.
McDaniel, 482 F.2d 305, 307 (8th Cir. 1973) (involving case where both local and federal
prosecutors were unaware of state statute conferring transactional immunity on all wit-
nesses who testify before state grand jury).

prosecution team has not derived evidence from the immunized testi-
mony or made nonevidentiary use of it.82
Garrity immunity is more likely to operate  as a trap for an un-
wary prosecutor.  It may not be apparent that a police officer's oral or
written statement is "compelled" within the meaning of Garrity. Un-
like  formal immunity grants, it is not always clear whether  or when
Garrity immunity has attached.  In Garrity, there was both a state stat-
ute requiring job termination for failure to answer questions and an
express threat of that result.83  Although  some early  decisions  sug-
gested that both were necessary to trigger Garrity protection,84 courts
more recently have found statements to be "compelled"  if a suspect
officer believes that refusal to answer questions will cause him to lose
his job and if there is an objective basis for that belief rooted in offi-
cial action.85  Application of this test expands the universe  of police
officers' statements that a court may deem "compelled,"  possibly in-
cluding statements other than those made to internal affairs investiga-
tors, such as arrest reports, use-of-force reports,  or postincident oral
statements  to supervisors.86  It also leaves the status of a police of-
ficer's statement uncertain until there has been litigation to determine
whether the subjective and objective prongs of the test have been sat-
isfied.  Without  a clear warning,  prosecutors  and  investigators  may
overlook the possibility that Garrity immunity has attached and thus
neglect to avoid exposure or take other precautions.
82 See, e.g., United States v. Semkiw, 712 F.2d 891, 895 (3d Cir. 1983) ("[Tlhe govern-
ment might easily have removed any cloud from the trial by assigning it to another attor-
ney who did not and would not review the immunized testimony.").
83  See supra notes 23-24 and accompanying text.
84  See, e.g., United States v. Indorato, 628 F.2d 711, 716 (1st Cir. 1980)  (holding that
explicit threat of discharge  and state statute or ordinance mandating discharge  was re-
quired to trigger Garrity immunity); People v. Sapp, 934 P.2d 1367, 1370-71 (Colo. 1997)
(discussing Indorato rule).
85  See, e.g., United States v. Friedrick, 842 F.2d 382, 395 (D.C. Cir. 1988) (holding ob-
jectively  reasonable  belief  sufficient  to  trigger  Garrity protection);  United  States  v.
Camacho, 739 F. Supp. 1504,1515 (S.D. Fla. 1990) (adopting Friedrick test); Sapp, 934 P.2d
at 1372-73 (adopting Friedrick test over Indorato test).
86  See, e.g., Camacho, 739 F. Supp. at 1511-12  (holding that informal statements  to
investigators who were at defendant's home to recover clothing were compelled).  Courts
have not been receptive to claims that the threat of discipline for insubordination alone
renders police reports or oral statements "compelled."  See, e.g., Sapp, 934 P.2d at 1373-74
(holding that subjective fear of discipline for insubordination without reasonable basis for
fear of termination is insufficient); People v. Bynum, 512 N.E.2d 826, 827 (111.  App. Ct.
1987) (holding accident report not compelled despite possibility of discipline for refusal to
complete); Commonwealth v. Harvey, 491 N.E.2d 607, 609-11 (Mass. 1986) (holding tape-
recorded statements  from interviews  admissible  despite  "possibility  of adverse  conse-
quences from the defendant's failure to cooperate").  Robert Myers has argued that police
reports  fall within the "required records"  exception  to the Fifth Amendment privilege,
rendering the Garrity doctrine inapplicable.  Myers, supra note 11, at 539.

Fifth, prosecutors are better able to limit dissemination  of immu-
nized testimony than compelled statements.  Prosecutors often elicit
immunized testimony in secret before a grand jury.87  A prosecutor's
office can satisfy its burden of disproving taint at a Kastigar hearing if
it  has prevented  dissemination  to potential  witnesses  and  assigned
unexposed prosecutors and investigators to the case against the per-
son who gave the immunized  testimony.88  When police department
investigators take compelled statements, however, the prosecution has
no similar ability to prevent or delay dissemination.89  Internal affairs
investigators may show or describe a suspect officer's compelled state-
ments to complainants  and witnesses as a routine investigative tech-
nique.90  Indeed,  they  may  have  a  legal  obligation  to disclose  the
compelled  statements  to all officers  subject to possible  disciplinary
proceedings  arising from the same incident, including police officers
who were present at the scene of the misconduct and therefore  are
potential prosecution witnesses.91 Thus, once an internal affairs inves-
See Fed. R. Crim. P. 6(e)(2) (mandating that matters occuring before federal grand
87 
jury remain secret); Wright, supra note 36, at 427-28 (describing prosecutors'  ability to
limit dissemination of immunized testimony).  If disclosure of immunized grand jury testi-
mony is necessary to comply with the prosecution's discovery obligations, the prosecution
can seek a protective order limiting unnecessary  dissemination.  See Fed. R. Crim. P.
16(d)(1).
88 See United States v. Bolton, 977 F.2d 1196, 1199 (7th Cir. 1992) (finding that assign-
ment of new prosecutors who had only minimal exposure to immunized testimony defeats
claim of nonevidentiary use); North 1, 910 F.2d 843, 872 (D.C. Cir. 1990) (holding that
prosecution can meet Kastigar burden by showing "that the witness was never exposed to
North's immunized testimony"); United States v. First NV.  State Bank of Minot, 491 F.2d
780, 785-87 (8th Cir. 1974) (holding that proof that prosecutors were unexposed to immu-
nized testimony satisfies prosecution's burden of disproving nonevidentiary use); State v.
Irizarry, 639 A.2d 305, 312 (NJ. Super. Ct. App. Div. 1994)  ("[S]ubstituting an assistant
prosecutor with no knowledge of the immunized testimony for one who does have knowl-
edge would seemingly be an effective step to bolster the State's position that no taint is

89 See United States v. Koon, 34 F.3d 1416, 1433 n.13 (9th Cir. 1994) ("[Blecause state-
ments [from police officers] may be compelled soon after the event in question, it is far
more likely that these statements will be circulated before there is an opportunity to can
testimony."), rev'd on other grounds, 518 U.S. 81 (1996).
90 See id. (noting that internal affairs investigators may circulate compelled statements
"out of a legitimate desire to ascertain the truth of the matter"); People V. Gillim, 274
Cal. Rptr. 415, 423 (Cal. Ct. App. 1990) (noting that victims and witnesses are frequently
exposed to police officers'  compelled statements); Perez & Muir, supra note 13, at 219

Officers, L.A. Tunes, Sept. 14, 1994, at Al ("[The LAPD] circulates copies of the com-

facing discipline.").

nary proceedings in connection with an incident.  Cal. Gov't Code § 3303(g) (West 1995);
see also Skelly v. State Pers. Bd., 539 P.2d 774,782 (Cal. 1975) (en banc) (holding that due

tigator has taken a police officer's compelled statement, the danger is
great that  she  will disseminate  it in a  manner  detrimental  to  later
prosecution.
Compounding these problems is the fact that exposure to a com-
pelled statement need not be direct (such as through reading or hear-
ing the statement itself); it can be indirect.  For example, a prosecutor
or investigator may be exposed by interviewing  a witness who com-
municates  facts  derived  from  her  exposure  to  a  compelled  state-
ment.92  Similarly, an exposed prosecutor  or investigator can taint a
witness.93  Whether  exposure  is  direct or indirect, the prosecution's
failure to disprove taint can result in loss of the evidence or dismissal
of the charges.94
In short, the fact that internal affairs investigators control the tak-
ing and dissemination of police officers' compelled statements creates
substantial  dangers  that are absent when prosecutors immunize wit-
nesses.  Police investigators making good-faith efforts to probe allega-
tions  of  misconduct  can  derail  a  criminal  case  inadvertently.
Moreover, even if committed to the task of properly investigating po-
lice  misconduct  for purposes  of imposing  administrative  discipline,
some internal  affairs investigators,  who may know or  have worked
with the suspect  officer, may disfavor criminal  prosecution.95  If in-
process requires that civil servants facing disciplinary procedures receive "written notice of
the proposed action...  [and] all materials relied upon to support the charges").
92 See, e.g., State v. Gault, 551 N.W.2d 719, 725 (Minn. Ct. App. 1996) (noting that
prosecutor can be "exposed indirectly" by discussing case with person exposed to Garrity
statements).
93  See, e.g., Sex Charge Dismissed Against Brainerd Cop, Star Trib. (Minneapolis-St.
Paul), Sept. 22, 1998, at 2B, 1998 WL 6369045 (describing case where court held that wit-
nesses were tainted when prosecutor informed them of contents of compelled statement).
In addition, even the questions that a prosecutor or investigator poses to a witness may be
tainted by a compelled statement.  See Pillsbury Co. v. Conboy, 459 U.S. 248, 255 (1983)
(holding that questions based on transcript of immunized testimony were "derived" from

An internal affairs investigator also may choose to "leak" a compelled statement to

That obligation, coupled with the threat of administrative discipline or
prosecution for false statements or perjury, may prompt some officers
to provide  truthful information  against fellow  officers.  In order to
avoid the difficult choice between providing truthful testimony against
a fellow officer or risking administrative sanction or prosecution  for
nondisclosure  or false statements,  unscrupulous  officers  falsely may
claim to be tainted by a compelled statement.  Even if the prosecution

to testify against other officers").  Commissions in New York City and Los Angeles found
that the police "code of silence"  is a pervasive impediment to investigations into police
criminality.  See Mollen Comm'n Rep., supra note 6, at 53-58 ("Officers who report mis-
conduct  are ostracized  and harassed; become targets  of complaints  and even physical
threats; and are made to fear that they will be left alone on the streets in a time of crisis.");
Christopher Comm'n Report, supra note 72, at 168-71 ("Perhaps the greatest single barrier
to the effective investigation and adjudication of complaints is the officers' unwritten 'code
of silence'...  [which] consists of one simple rule:  an officer does not provide adverse
information against a fellow officer.").
99 See, e.g., 3 L.A. Police Dep't Manual § 815.05 (2000) ("When any employee who is
not a supervisor becomes aware of possible misconduct by another member of this Depart-
ment, the employee shall immediately notify a supervisor.").

[E]ven if North's assertion [that, when called as a prosecution witness against
Poindexter, he was unable to segregate his personal knowledge of events sur-
rounding the Iran-Contra scandal from what he heard from Poindexter's tele-
vised immunized testimony]  were to be given no weight,  the [independent
counsel] would still have failed to meet his burden, which is to demonstrate
that the immunized testimony did not influence the witness.).
The prosecutor could prevail in such a situation only if she could demonstrate that  the
allegedly tainted witness had not been directly or indirectly  exposed to the  compelled
statement.
101  Claims of taint also enable witness officers to avoid speaking to criminal investiga-
tors or prosecutors.  If an officer maintains that he is tainted by a compelled statement,
investigators or prosecutors likely will refrain from interviewing him to avoid a claim that,
through  information received from him, they have been exposed to the content of the
compelled statement. See State v. Gault, 551 N.W.2d 719,725 (Minn. Ct. App. 1996) (not-
ing that prosecutor can be "exposed indirectly" by discussing case with person exposed to
Garrity statements).

Unfortunately, the danger of a witness engaging in such conduct
is not fanciful.102  In the California state prosecution of the police of-
ficers who used excessive force when arresting Rodney King, a crucial
witness successfully made such a claim.  The prosecution planned  to
call Sergeant Fred Nichols to testify that the defendants' conduct vio-
lated LAPD use-of-force policy.'03  Nichols, a nationally known use-
of-force expert, was a compelling witness, having served as "officer-in-
charge"  of the LAPD physical training and self-defense  unit 34  He
already had appeared  before the state grand jury that returned  the
indictment in the case, testifying that the defendants' conduct violated
LAPD use-of-force policy.105  The LAPD later demoted  Nichols,06
who took a stress-related leave of absence.07  When the prosecution

may have watched North's immunized testimony in order to undermine the criminal prose-
cution, North I, 910 F.2d at 920 n.7 (Wald, CJ., dissenting) (asserting that Justice Depart-
ment officials from same Administration as North, "presumably aware of... Kastigar...
soaked themselves in the immunized testimony"); and that similar sabotage could occur in
the future, North II, 920 F.2d at 953 (Wald, CJ., dissenting) ("[Tlhe majority provides an
easy out for conflicted government officials; they can immunize theirc olleagues from pros-
ecution by exposing themselves to immunized testimony."). The majority did not deny that
such a scenario could occur.  Rather, it concluded that proof of such conduct would not
matter when  assessing  whether  use  of the  immunized  testimony  violated  the  Fifth
Amendment:
The more important point, however, is that such a conspiracy-even  if it ex-
isted-would be entirely irrelevant to the issue before us, which is whether or
not North's Fifth Amendment right was violated.  The Department of Justice
could have held evening classes in "The Parsing and Deconstruction of Kasti-
gar" for the very purpose of "derailing" the [Independent Counsel's] prosecu-
tion, and such a curriculum would have been simply irrelevant to the question
of whether or not the prosecution's  case made use of North's compelled
testimony.

burden of proof under Kastigar. Id.  A federal court had reached a similar conclusion

cal  evidence.116  Courts  also  suppress  evidence  or dismiss  charges
without published  decisions.117  Perhaps  more significantly,  Garrity
may cause prosecutors to refrain from bringing charges or calling wit-
nesses at trial.1 8  When investigating cases and determining whether
to seek charges, prosecutors have little choice but to assume (absent
clear authority to the contrary) that the full panoply of use restrictions
applies to compelled statements.  Although some courts have not yet
determined whether to adopt restrictions on nonevidentiary and indi-
rect evidentiary uses of compelled statements or to equate the scope
of Garrity immunity with that of formal immunity, it would be fool-
hardy to bring a case against police officers built on potentially tainted
evidence or strategy, particularly in light of possible judicial sympathy
for such defendants.119
One indication of the severity of the problem is that the Depart-
ment  of Justice  has developed  an  elaborate  approach  to evidence
116 See, e.g., Kinamon v. United States (In re Grand Jury Proceedings), 45 F.3d 343,347-
48 (9th Cir. 1995) (holding that use of compelled statement before grand jury may require
dismissal); United States v. Friedrick, 842 F.2d 382, 400-02 (D.C. Cir. 1988)  (suppressing
compelled statement of FBI agent); United States v. Camacho, 739 F. Supp. 1504, 1512
(S.D. Fla. 1990)  (suppressing statements  that followed formally compelled statements);
State v. Gault, 551 N.W.2d 719, 724-25 (Minn. Ct. App. 1996) (upholding trial court's sup-
pression of witness testimony because of prosecution's failure to disprove direct and indi-
rect exposure to compelled statements and dismissal of indictment for failure to disprove
nonevidentiary use); cf. Holloway v. State, 339 A.2d 319 (Md. Ct. Spec. App. 1975) (hold-
ing admission of compelled statement erroneous but harmless).
117 See, e.g., Sex Charge Dismissed Against Brainerd Cop, supra note 93 (describing
dismissal of sexual misconduct case because witnesses were informed of contents of com-
pelled statements); Stalking Charges Against Policeman Dropped, Star Trib. (Minneapolis-
St. Paul), July 19, 1996, at 3B, 1996 WL 6921117 (describing dismissal of stalking charges
against police officer resulting from prosecutor's access to compelled statement).

pelled statements served as obstacles to prosecution); cf. Wright, supra note 36, at 436 &
n.117 (suggesting that congressional immunity grants, although far less common, may have
same effect).
A recent, and bizarre, manifestation of the Garrity immunity problem occurred  in
connection with efforts to investigate the LAPD Rampart Division scandal.  Apparently
concerned that the local district attorney was not willing or able to avoid taint from com-
pelled statements, LAPD officials refused to share evidence with the district attorney until
federal prosecutors had first screened it. The district attorney accused the police chief of
withholding evidence,  and the police chief called the district attorney  a liar. See Jim

gathering and review in investigations of police criminality.120 The ap-
proach is designed to minimize potential damage by identifying com-
pelled  statements,  determining  whether  witnesses  or  evidence  are
tainted, ascertaining whether there are independent sources for possi-
bly tainted evidence, and ensuring that the prosecutors and investiga-
tors assigned to the case are not exposed to tainted evidence.
In order to accomplish those objectives, one team of investigators
and prosecutors-the  "Garrity team" or "dirty team"-is assigned to
review all of the evidence  in the criminal  investigation  of a  law en-
forcement officer.12'  A separate  team of investigators  and prosecu-
tors-the "trial team" or "clean team"-is responsible for presenting
the case to a grand jury, and, if appropriate, trying the case.22  The
trial team  cannot interview any witnesses  or review  any  documents
until the Garrity team has given its approval.1l'
The Garrity team first determines whether the target of the inves-
tigation made statements.  As noted above, courts  apply a test with
subjective and objective elements that requires  consideration  of the
circumstances under which a police officer made a statement in order
to determine whether it is "compelled.' 124  The Garrity team can re-
lease  to the trial  team any  documents  generated  before  the target
made  statements,  confident  that they are untainted.  If the  Garrity
team concludes that a target police officer has made one or more pos-
sibly compelled statements, it screens all witnesses and documents to
determine  whether they  have  been  tainted.  For witnesses,  this re-
quires that the Garrity team interview them to ascertain whether they
have been exposed, either directly or indirectly,  to the contents  of a
compelled  statement,  and if so, whether  they  have  an independent
source for the information they possess and whether exposure to the

compelled statement has affected their recollection of events.125  Un-
less the Garrity team is satisfied that it can meet its Kastigarb urden of
disproving taint with respect to a witness, it will deny the trial team
access to that witness.126
This process places considerable constraints on a criminal investi-
gation.  First, it requires that the investigating agency and the prosecu-
tor's  office  assign  a  full  team  of  investigators  and  prosecutors  to
screen witnesses  and documents  and  to litigate  KastigarlGarrityi s-
sues.-27  Although the Department of Justice  is able to muster suffi-
cient resources to accomplish this, state and local prosecutors'  offices
with small staffs may be unable to do so.  They instead may be faced
with a choice of conducting an investigation that may prove fruitless
because investigators and  prosecutors  become  tainted,  or foregoing
prosecution of police officers who have made compelled statements.
Second, it makes the investigative process cumbersome and inef-
ficient.  The trial team receives evidence only as it trickles through the
Garrity team filter.  This generally slows an investigation, and can de-
lay the availability of specific pieces of evidence that the trial team
needs to investigate the case properly.  As a result, the trial team may
be forced  to conduct  interviews  of some witnesses  without  having
done a complete preliminary investigation-such as reviewing perti-
nent  documents  or interviewing  other  witnesses-because  needed
documents or witnesses are not yet screened.
Nor does this process eliminate the possibility of lost evidence.  If
the  Garrity team identifies  witnesses or documents that are tainted,
that evidence remains unavailable to the trial team.  At best, the pro-
cess prevents damage from further direct or indirect exposure to com-
pelled statements.
Tim  GARPrTy DocrRnm's UNCERTAIN FOUNDATION
When the Supreme Court decided Garrity and Kastigar,i t did not
anticipate the robust protection that lower courts later would give to
police officers' compelled statements.  Nor did it foresee the resulting
125 See Dobinski Declaration, supra note 120, at 2. In the Ninth Circuit, the existence of
an independent source is enough to satisfy the Fifth Amendment without consideration of
the effect the compelled statement may have had on witnesses.  See supra note 57 (describ-
ing Ninth Circuit rule).
126 See Dobinski Declaration, supra note 120, at 2-3.  The Garrity team uses a similar
process to screen documents. If a document or portions thereof contain information either
derived from a compelled statement or created by a tainted witness, the Garrity team de-
nies the trial team access to the tainted portions.  Id.

1342  NEW YORK  UNIVERSITY  LAW REVIEW  [Vol. 76:1309
problems  described  above.  Indeed,  the  Garrity majority  made  no
mention of the immunity analogy.128  Instead, it determined that the
due process protection for coerced confessions (and, to a lesser extent,
the  unconstitutional  conditions  doctrine)  required  suppression.129
Even had the Garrity Court equated  compelled  statements with im-
munized testimony, however, it likely would not have  contemplated
the extraordinary  protection that compelled statements now receive.
When the Court decided Kastigar five years after Garrity, it assumed
that restrictions  on use  of immunized  testimony were  the  same as
those  applied  to  coerced  confessions. 30  Only  later  would  lower
courts interpret Kastigar and the privilege to impose prohibitions on
nonevidentiary  and  indirect  evidentiary  use  of  immunized  testi-
mony,131  restrictions  that  courts  never  have  applied  to  coerced
confessions.132
Although the Garrity and Kastigar Courts did not foresee either
the shift to the immunity analogy as an explanation for suppression of
compelled statements  or the rigorous prohibitions  that lower  courts
have imposed on use of immunized testimony, both developments are
understandable.  First, as described below, the immunity analogy bet-
ter explains the suppression of compelled  statements than the ratio-
nales  that the  Garrity Court offered.133  Second,  the imposition  of
more stringent restrictions  on prosecutorial use of immunized testi-
mony, and, by analogy, police officer's compelled statements, is con-
sistent with differences  between the Court's reasons for suppressing
immunized testimony and coerced confessions. 34
A.  The Garrity Court's Analysis
1.  Compelled Statements as Coerced Confessions
The Garrity majority relied primarily on the due process protec-
tion  against coerced  confessions  to justify suppression  of the com-
128 At the outset of its opinion, the Court noted that "[n]o immunity was granted [to
Garrity and the others who were questioned], as there is no immunity statute applicable in
these circumstances."  Garrity v. New Jersey, 385 U.S. 493, 495 (1967).  The Court made
only passing reference to the Fifth Amendment privilege.  Id. at 497 & n.5, 499-500.  Only
Justice White, in dissent in the companion case of Spevack v. Klein, 385 U.S. 511 (1967),
acknowledged the similarity between police officers' compelled statements and immunized
testimony.  Id. at 532 (White, J., dissenting).
129  See infra notes 135-36, 163-64 and accompanying text. The Court later embraced the
view that the Fifth Amendment privilege itself mandates the suppression of police officers'
compelled statements as "immunized."  See supra note 31 and accompanying text.
130 See infra notes 200-01 and accompanying text.

pelled  statements.  The  Court  framed  the  issue  as  whether  "the
statements [were]  products of coercion in violation of the Fourteenth
Amendment" 35 and held that "the protection of the individual under
the Fourteenth Amendment  against coerced statements prohibits use
in  subsequent  criminal  proceedings  of  statements  obtained  under
threat of removal from office ....  ,,62
However, even a cursory examination of the due process volunta-
riness test reveals that the Garrity Court's conclusion is problematic.
The Court has described the due process test as follows:
The ultimate test remains that which has been the only clearly es-
tablished test in Anglo-American courts for two hundred years:  the
test of voluntariness.  Is the confession the product of an essentially
free and unconstrained choice by its maker?  If it is, if he has willed
to confess, it may be used against him.  If it is not, if his will has
been overborne and his capacity for self-determination critically im-
paired, the use of his confession offends due process.137
The Court uses a fact-specific approach when entertaining allega-
tions that a confession was coerced.  "In determining whether a defen-
dant's will was overborne in a particular case, the Court has assessed
the totality of all the surrounding circumstances-both the character-
istics of the accused and the details of the interrogation."13s  Indeed,
"a detailed account...  is unavoidable." 139
The inquiry into whether a person's decision to answer questions
is "involuntary,"  "coerced,"'14  or the result of an "overborne will" is
hardly an exact  science.14'  In practice,  two  concerns  that are only

or improper inducement can be determined by an examination of all of the attendant
circumstances.").
139 Culombe, 367 U.S. at 606.
140 The Court treats the terms "coerced  confession" and "involuntary  confession" as
synonyms.  Arizona v. Fulminante, 499 U.S. 279, 287 n.3 (1991).
141  See Joseph D. Grano, Confessions, Truth, and the Law 60 (1993)  ("[Tlhe issue of

somewhat related to the defendant's exercise of free will have guided
the Court142-fear  of unreliable  confessions  resulting from coercive
interrogation  techniques143  and  condemnation  of  improper  police
methods of extracting confessions. 44  Although some older decisions
suggest that confessions that are not the result of free will should be
suppressed  regardless  of the methods police used to obtain them,145
the Court repudiated that view in Colorado v. Connelly.146 There, the
Court held that police misconduct is a prerequisite for finding that a
confession violates  due process.147  The  Connelly majority  also con-
cluded that concern about the reliability of a confession "is a matter to
judgments, but neither is satisfactory.  One defines "voluntary" as the result of a conscious
effort by the actor. Under this view, even the confession of a defendant who is tortured is
voluntary because he consciously chooses to confess rather than endure additional torture.
The other approach defines as involuntary any choice that the actor would not have made
but for official action. Even the mildest forms of official pressure could render confessions
coerced under this approach.  For a discussion of these issues, see Grano, supra, at 59-83.
142 See Miller v. Fenton, 474 U.S. 104, 116 (1985) (describing "the Court's consistently
held view that the admissibility of a confession turns as much on whether the techniques
for extracting the statements, as applied to this suspect, are compatible with a system that
presumes  innocence and assures  that a conviction will  not be secured  by inquisitorial
means as on whether the defendant's will was in fact overborne").
143  See, e.g., Brown v. Mississippi, 297 U.S. 278, 282 (1936)  (
"[T]hey were likewise made by the said deputy definitively to understand that
the whipping would be continued unless and until they confessed, and not only
confessed, but confessed in every matter of detail as demanded by those pre-
sent; and in this manner the defendants confessed the crime, and as the whip-
pings progressed and were repeated, they changed or adjusted their confession
in all particulars of detail so as to conform to the demands of their torturers."
(quoting Brown v. State, 161 So. 465, 470 (Miss. 1935) (Griffith, J., dissenting))).
144  See, e.g., Colorado v. Connelly, 479 U.S. 157, 164 (1986) (explaining that all cases in
which Supreme Court has found confessions to be involuntary "contained  a substantial
element of coercive police conduct"); Haynes v. Washington,  373 U.S. 503, 519 (1963)
(finding confession  to be involuntary in case where police used "oppressive  and unfair
methods").
145  See, e.g., Townsend v. Sain, 372 U.S. 293, 308 (1963)  (stating that if drugs that police
physician administered to alleviate defendant's heroin withdrawal symptoms had effect of
"truth serum" promoting confession to robbery and murder, "[a]ny questioning by police
officers which produces [such] a confession ...  renders that confession inadmissible" even
if police did not intend that effect); 2 Wayne R. LaFave et al., Criminal Procedure § 6.2(b)

under circumstances in which the defendant's free choice was significantly impaired, even
if the police did not resort to offensive practices").

147 See id. at 167. In Connelly, the Court stated that its due process cases all shared "the
crucial element of police overreaching," id. at 163, and held "that coercive police activity is
a necessary predicate to the finding that a confession is not 'voluntary' within the meaning
of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment," id. at 167; see also LaFave et

tional doctrine.148
It is difficult to explain Garrity given the Court's coerced confes-
sion jurisprudence either before or after Connelly. First, the interro-
gation method did not threaten to produce  an unreliable confession.
The warning that the deputy attorney general gave to Garrity and the
others made clear that they could avoid job loss simply by answering
questions.  Thus, unlike some coerced confession cases, there was no
pressure likely to induce the interviewees  to give false incriminating
149
statements.
Second, there was  no improper  conduct.  The  deputy  attorney
general's warning of job termination in Garrity was perfectly legal.150
Had Garrity chosen to remain silent, it is likely that the Court would
have found that both the imposition of the economic sanction and the
warning thereof were constitutional.151  The following Term,  at least
eight Justices  agreed that "[iff...  a policeman  [refuses]  to answer
questions specifically, directly, and narrowly relating to the perform-
ance of his official duties ...  the privilege against self-incrimination  [is
not] a bar to his dismissal,"152 a view that the Court later would reiter-
148 Connelly, 479 U.S. at 167.  For a discussion of the development of confession law,
see, for example, Yale Kamisar, On the "Fruits" of Miranda Violations, Coerced Confes-
sions, and Compelled Testimony, 93 Mich. L Rev. 929, 936-46 (1995),  which traces  the
changes in the treatment of confessions' reliability as a rationale for their exclusion.
149  Although the interviewees may have feared a prosecution for perjury or false state-
ments if they falsely exonerated themselves or others, they made no claim that they were
coerced into wrongly confessing to the suspected offenses or that compulsion was likely to
lead to that result. See Garrity, 385 U.S. at 503 (Harlan, J., dissenting) ("The defense did
not contend that the statements were the result of physical or mental coercion, or that the
wills of the... petitioners were overborne.").
150 The defendants challenged the constitutionality of the job forfeiture statute.  How-
ever, the Supreme Court, like the New Jersey courts, did not consider that issue, instead
focusing on the voluntariness of the statements.  Id. at 496.
151  In Spevack v. Klein, 385 U.S. 511 (1967),  decided the same day as Garrity, five Jus-
tices suggested as much. In Spevack, the Court considered whether a state could disbar an
attorney for asserting the privilege rather than complying with a subpoena related to a
judicial inquiry. A four-member plurality held that "[tlhe threat of disbarment and the loss
of professional standing, professional reputation, and of livelihood are powerful forms of
compulsion" and concluded that a disbarment in response to a valid assertion of the privi-
lege violated the Fifth Amendment.  Id. at 516. But Justice Fortas, who provided the deci-
sive fifth vote, noted that "[t]his Court has never held .. that a policeman may not be
discharged for refusal in disciplinary proceedings to testify as to his conduct as a police
officer" and made clear that he "would distinguish between a lawyer's right to remain
silent and that of a public employee who is asked questions specifically, directly, and nar-
rowly relating to the performance of his official duties .... "  Id. at 519 (Fortas, J., concur-
ring  in  the  judgment).  The  four  Spevack  dissenters  also  would  have  allowed  the
termination of an uncooperative police officer, id. at 528 (Harlan, J.,di ssenting); id. at 531
(White, J., dissenting).
152  Gardner v. Broderick, 392 U.S. 273, 278 (1968) (footnote and citation omitted).  Al-
though Justices Harlan and Stewart concurred in the result only, they considered it a "wel-

ate.153  If it is constitutional to dismiss a police officer who refuses to
answer questions  related to a disciplinary  matter, it could  not have
been improper for the deputy attorney general to provide Garrity and
the  others  notice  of  that  consequence.154  Unlike  interrogators  in
other coerced confession cases, the questioner in Garrity did nothing
55
wrong.
Third, in Garrity, the Court departed from the methodology that
it uses elsewhere to decide whether a confession is "coerced."  Rather
than examine all of the available evidence to determine whether the
statements were voluntary, the majority ignored significant facts that
undercut  a finding of coercion.  Garrity and the others were not in
custody when questioned. 56  They made the statements during sworn
depositions recorded by a stenographer, rather than in the secrecy of a
police interrogation room. 57  Garrity himself had selected  the room
where he was to be questioned. 58  Three of the officers had counsel
present. 59  When they sought suppression  of the statements  before
trial, the defendants presented no evidence of coercion other than the
threat of job forfeiture. 60  Not surprisingly, both the trial courts and
the  Supreme  Court  of New Jersey  determined  that the  statements
were voluntary.'61 Of course, the threatened loss of their employment
come breakthrough" that the Court had made clear that "public officials  may now  be
discharged..,  for refusing to divulge to appropriate authority information pertinent to the
faithful performance of their offices."  Id. at 285 (Harlan, J., concurring).  Justice Black
concurred without writing or joining an opinion.  Id. at 279.
153  See Lefkowitz v. Cunningham,  431 U.S. 801,  806 (1977)  ("Public employees may
constitutionally be discharged for refusing to answer potentially incriminating questions
concerning their official duties if they have not been required to surrender their constitu-
tional immunity."); Lefkowitz v. Turley, 414 U.S. 70, 80-82 (1973) (noting that public offi-
cials may be discharged for failing to answer questions regarding official duties).
154  See Garrity, 385 U.S. at 506-07 (Harlan, J., dissenting) ("If the consequence is consti-
tutionally permissible, there can surely be no objection if the state cautions the witness that
it may follow if he remains silent.").
155 The deputy attorney general's additional admonition that any statements would be
admissible in a later criminal prosecution ultimately proved to be incorrect, but that warn-
ing could not have induced the interviewees to give a statement. If anything, it would have
dissuaded them from answering questions.

and pensions was relevant  to a determination  of voluntariness.  But
rather  than weigh that fact against  others which suggested  that the
statements were voluntary, the Garrity majority neglected to consider
countervailing  facts,  an  approach  at  odds  with  its  established
practice.162
2.  Compelled Statements as the Product
of an Unconstitutional Condition
Perhaps cognizant of deficiencies in its due process explanation,
the Garrity majority also suggested in a single sentence that the choice
that New Jersey presented to the police  officers-of making poten-
tially self-incriminating statements or losing their jobs-was an uncon-
stitutional condition.163  Although the majority did not elaborate on
that suggestion, the dissenting Justices  contended that "the majority
believe[d]  that the possibility that these policemen  might have been
discharged had they refused to provide information pertinent to their
public responsibilities [was]  an impermissible 'condition'  imposed by
New Jersey upon petitioners'  privilege against self-incrimination."1'64
giving of the defendants' statements in the present case are even more persuasive of volun-
tariness than in Naglee. For here the defendants gave their statements ...  in the presence
of their lawyer.").
162 See Schneckloth v. Bustamonte, 412 U.S. 218,226 (1973) ("The significant fact about
all of these [coerced confession] decisions is that none of them turned on the presence or
absence of a single controlling criterion; each reflected a careful scrutiny of all the sur-
rounding circumstances.").
163  See Garrity, 385 U.S. at 500 ("There are rights of constitutional stature whose exer-
cise a State may not condition by the exaction of a price."). Justice Douglas (the author of
Garrity) and commentators have characterized Garrity as a case that turned on application
of the "unconstitutional conditions doctrine."  See Jones v. State Bd. of Educ., 397 U.S. 31,
34 (1970) (Douglas, J., dissenting) (citing Garrity for proposition that "a government, state
or federal, may not grant a benefit or privilege on conditions requiring the recipient to
relinquish his constitutional rights"); Eric Schnapper, Unreasonable Searches and Seizures
of Papers, 71 Va. L. Rev. 869, 927 n318 (1985) (citing Garrity as case demonstrating that
"[the doctrine of unconstitutional conditions applies to conditions on the exercise of fifth
amendment rights"); Developments in the Law-Public Employment, 97 Harv. L  Rev.
1611, 1746 (1984)  (citing Garrity as case in which Court relied on doctrine of unconstitu-
tional conditions).
164  Garrity, 385 U.S. at 501 (Harlan, J., dissenting).  The Court's apparent reliance on
both the coerced confessions and unconstitutional conditions doctrines prompted the dis-
senters to accuse the majority of "employ[ing] a curious mixture of doctrines to invalidate
these convictions"  and "apparently engag[ing]  in the delicate task of riding two unruly
horses at once .... "  Id.

In hindsight, the majority's decision not to embrace the doctrine more
openly was sensible, as it is neither sufficient nor necessary to explain
the outcome in Garrity.
The unconstitutional  conditions  doctrine  prohibits governments
from conditioning government-sponsored  benefits on recipients'  will-
ingness  to  engage  in  or abstain  from  activity  that the  Constitution
shields  from  direct  government  interference.165  Because  the  Fifth
Amendment privilege prevents governments from compelling incrimi-
nating statements directly, the doctrine casts doubt on New Jersey's
attempt to accomplish the same result by threatening to terminate  a
benefit-state-sponsored  employment.  Arguably, the remedy for citi-
zens like Garrity, who succumb to the condition, is to deny to the state
what the Constitution prevents  it from obtaining directly-here,  the
ability to use the statement in a criminal prosecution.
By prohibiting governments from firing employees for exercising
their constitutional rights, the unconstitutional conditions doctrine re-
futes Holmes's oft-quoted observation that "the petitioner may have a
constitutional right to talk politics, but he has no constitutional right
cluded that the Court opted for the Fifth Amendment interpretation of Garrity in Lefko-
witz v. Turley, 414 U.S. 70 (1973).  See Solomon, 509 F.2d at 867 n.6.
165  See generally Lynn A. Baker, The Prices of Rights:  Toward a Positive Thcory  of
Unconstitutional Conditions, 75 Cornell L. Rev. 1185, 1193-94 (1990) ("In its classical for-
mulation, the unconstitutional conditions doctrine prohibits conditions on allocations in
which the government indirectly impinges on a protected activity or choice in a way that
would be unconstitutional if the same result had been achieved through a direct govern-
mental command."); Sullivan, supra  note 141, at 1421-22 ("Unconstitutional  conditions
problems arise when government offers a benefit on condition that the recipient perform
or forego an activity that a preferred constitutional right normally protects from govern-
ment interference.").  For a summary of the literature on the doctrine,  see William J.
Stuntz, Implicit Bargains, Government Power, and the Fourth Amendment, 44 Stan. L.
Rev. 553, 567 n.52 (1992).
Courts often apply the doctrine to conditions imposed on the exercise of constitutional
rights other than the Fifth Amendment privilege.  See, e.g., O'Hare Truck Serv., Inc. v. City
of Northlake, 518 U.S. 712, 714-15 (1996)  (termination of government contract in retalia-
tion for refusing to respond to requests for political support); Bd. of County Comm'rs v.
Umbehr, 518 U.S. 668, 673-74 (1996)  (termination of government contract in response to
exercise of First Amendment rights); Dolan v. City of Tigard, 512 U.S. 374, 377, 391 (1994)
(grant of building permit conditioned on relinquishment of property rights); cf. id. at 407
n.12 (Stevens, J., dissenting)  ("[M]odern decisions invoking the doctrine have most frc-
quently involved First Amendment liberties."  (citations omitted)).
Arguably, the Court employed the doctrine to invalidate conditions imposed on the
Fifth Amendment privilege in Griffin v. California, 380 U.S. 609 (1965).  When determin-
ing that a law permitting prosecutorial comment on a defendant's failure to testify at trial
was unconstitutional, the Griffin Court condemned such comment as "a penalty imposed
by courts for exercising a constitutional privilege.  It cuts down on the privilege by making
its assertion costly."  Id. at 614.  But see infra note 183 (describing view that Griffin is best
explained as application of Fifth Amendment privilege).
HeinOnline -- 76 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 1348 2001
Imaged with the Permission of N.Y.U. Law ReviewNovember 2001] GARRITY IMMUNITY
to be a policeman.' 66  Given this, it is remarkable that the Garrity
Court did not more explicitly embrace the doctrine in response to the
similar contention that Justice Harlan made in dissent:  that Garrity
and the others "had a constitutional right to refuse to answer... [but]
they had no constitutional right to remain police officers."167  Justice
Harlan's point has some appeal.  Noting that the state constitutionally
could fire a police officer who refused to answer questions related to
the performance  of his  duties,168 a proposition that the Court later
would embrace,169 Harlan reasoned that "[i]f the consequence is con-
stitutionally permissible, there can surely be no objection if the State
cautions the witness that it may follow if he remains silent."170
However, Justice Harlan's  position does not answer the critical
question in Garrity: whether, having  obtained  a  condition-induced
statement, the government may introduce it in a criminal proceeding.
For, although the Court now permits the termination of a police of-
ficer  or other  public  employee  who  refuses  to  answer job-related
questions, it does not allow the government to demand  a waiver of
immunity under pain of job loss as well.171  In other words, the Court
permits the government  to put an employee to  the choice of either
giving a statement that will not be admissible in a criminal proceeding
or losing his job.  It does not, however, permit the government to use
the threat of job termination to obtain both a statement and the em-

tional conditions, "[t]oday, police officers and other public officials have the right to talk
politics and retain their jobs ...." David Cole, Beyond Unconstitutional  Conditions:

ployee's  waiver  of  immunity,  allowing  later  use  of  the  statement
against the employee in a criminal prosecution.172  In Garrity, the dep-
uty attorney general told the interviewees that their statements would
be admissible in criminal prosecutions.173  They had no reason to dis-
believe  that  assertion.  As  a  result,  he  presented  them  with  the
equivalent of the government-induced  choice that the Court has since
condemned:  giving  a statement  without immunity or being fired.174
In short, suppression  of the  statements in  Garrity was  necessary  to
prevent the state from carrying out what the Court later determined
to be an unconstitutional threat.
But this does not explain why it was unconstitutional to confront
the Garrity defendants with these  options.  Given the importance  of
the government interest in the administrative and criminal investiga-
tion and prosecution of police criminality, it is not immediately obvi-
ous  that  the  Constitution  should  preclude  the  government  from
compelling a police officer's statement and later using it in a criminal
proceeding. 75  At times, the Court does not bar the government from
conditioning  benefits  on  recipients'  willingness  to  forego  constitu-
172 The Court has not decided whether an express immunity waiver, if obtained, would
be valid. See, e.g., Gardner,3 92 U.S. at 278-79 (refusing to decide whether Garrity would
"nullify" waiver made under threat of job loss).
173  See Garrity, 385 U.S. at 494.
174  When the Court first decided Garrity and the companion case of Spevack v. Klein,
385 U.S. 511 (1967), it appeared that it may have been prohibiting both sanctions for refus-
als to answer questions and the use of statements in criminal cases. In Spevack, a plurality
of the Court prohibited imposition of sanctions-disbarment-following  an attorney's as-
sertion of the privilege in response to a subpoena duces tecum.  Id. Because Garrity would
have prevented use of any self-incriminating statements compelled by a threat of disbar-
ment, Justice White criticized the apparently contradictory double prohibition.  Id. at 531
(White, J., dissenting).
Later, however, the Court made clear that states can impose economic sanctions for
refusals to answer so long as the interviewees retain their right to exclude their answers in
criminal proceedings.  It explained its refusal to enforce economic sanctions in cases like
Spevack by noting that before the Garrity decision, it was uncertain whether compelled
statements would be admissible.  See Sanitation Men, 392 U.S. at 283-84.  Without assur-
ance of exclusion, the subject of the compulsion could assert the privilege and escape sanc-
tion.  Justice  Harlan,  who  had dissented  in  both  Garrity and  Spevack, found  some
consolation in the conclusion that economic sanctions were still available so long as there
was no required waiver of immunity.  He concurred in Gardnera nd Sanitation Men, which
permitted that outcome,
with a good deal less reluctance than would otherwise have been the case be-
cause ...  I find in these opinions a procedural formula whereby, for example,
public officials may now be discharged...  for refusing to divulge to appropri-
ate authority information pertinent to the faithful performance of their offices.
I add only that this is a welcome breakthrough in what Spevack and Garrity
might otherwise have been thought to portend.

tional protections.176  Indeed, as students of the unconstitutional con-
ditions doctrine have noted, it is difficult  to predict  how cases will
come out when the Court applies it.177  In short, reliance on the doc-
trine alone is insufficient to explain the outcome in Garrity.
In addition,  resort  to the  doctrine  may be  unnecessary.  Cass
Sunstein has argued that "[w]hether  a condition is permissible  is  a
function of the particular constitutional provision at issue" and cannot
be answered by "anything so general as an unconstitutional conditions
doctrine."178  He recommends  discarding the doctrine in favor of a
more detailed assessment of the specific constitutional right to deter-
mine whether  the government's  exercise of economic  or regulatory
authority violates the right. 79  Whatever the merit of Sunstein's posi-
tion generally,  the doctrine  seems particularly  redundant  when the
Fifth Amendment  privilege  is  at  issue, as  the  following  discussion
illustrates.80
176 See, e.g., Wyman v. James, 400 U.S. 309, 324 (1971)  (holding that government can
condition receipt of public assistance on permission to allow caseworker to enter home,
even though warrantless entry  by state actor without consent would otherwise violate
Fourth Amendment).
177 See Baker, supra note 165, at 1187 ("The unconstitutional conditions doctrine itself
remains murky.  The Court has provided no coherent explication of when and how it will
apply the doctrine in [the public assistance benefits area), and commentators' attempts to
make sense of these cases have produced only expressions of despair and normative pro-
posals."); Sullivan, supra note 141, at 1415-16 ("[R]ecent Supreme Court decisions on chal-
lenges to unconstitutional conditions seem a minefield to be traversed gingerly. Just when
the doctrine appears secure, new decisions arise to explode it....  As applied ...  the

One way of explaining the unconstitutional conditions doctrine is
to focus on the coercion that the government-induced condition brings
to bear on the rightholder.181  Arguably, at some  point, the level  of
coercion  renders  the  condition  unconstitutional.  But  the  Fifth
Amendment privilege itself is triggered by "compulsion"  exerted by
the government to induce self-incrimination.182 Because both inquir-
ies focus on compulsion, it seems unnecessary, and unduly confusing,
to  resort  to  the  doctrine  and  ask  whether  a  government-induced
choice is sufficiently coercive  to constitute an unconstitutional condi-
tion on the exercise of the privilege.  A more direct approach  is to
determine  simply  whether  the  government  has  compelled  self-
incrimination.183
B.  Compelled Statements as Immunized Testimony
Resort to the Fifth Amendment privilege  and the related immu-
nity analogy avoids the shortcomings  of efforts to explain Garrity by
use of the coerced  confessions  and unconstitutional  conditions  doc-
trines.  First, the immunity analogy better  explains what occurred in
Garrity, as  well  as what  typically  happens  when  investigators  take
compelled statements from police officers.  The deputy attorney gen-
eral questioned Garrity and the others as part of a noncriminal judi-
cial  inquiry,  not  an  effort  to  further  their  prosecution,184 just  as
analysis that permits the drawing of careful lines between permissible  and impermissible
burdens").
181  See Sullivan, supra note 141, at 1428 ("Directly and through metaphors of duress or
penalty, the Court has repeatedly suggested that the problem with unconstitutional condi-
tions is their coercive effect.").
182  See, e.g., Lefkowitz v. Cunningham, 431 U.S. 801, 806 (1977)  (stating that compul-
sion is "touchstone" of Fifth Amendment privilege); Amar & Lettow, supra note 38, at 865
("The Fifth Amendment does not prohibit all self-incrimination but only compelled self-
incrimination.").
183  Professor Albert Alschuler has made a similar contention about Griffin v. California,
380 U.S. 609 (1965), in which the Supreme Court determined that prosecutorial comment
on a defendant's silence at trial is unconstitutional. Alschuler, supra note 141, at 2628 n.11
(contending that resort to unconstitutional conditions doctrine was unnecessary as "the
Fifth Amendment [privilege], pure and simple" explains the outcome in Griffin); see also
Ohio Adult Parole Auth. v. Woodard, 523 U.S. 272, 285-86 (1998) (finding it unnecessary
to address lower  court's  unconstitutional  conditions  analysis  because  challenged  state
clemency procedures "do not under any view violate the Fifth Amendment privilege").
184  The deputy attorney general questioned Garrity and the others pursuant to orders
from the Supreme Court of New Jersey directing the Attorney General or a deputy attor-
ney general to conduct an investigation into "alleged irregularities in the handling of cases
in the Municipal Court" in the boroughs of Bellmawr and Barrington.  Brief for Appellants
app. B at 3a-4a, 6a-7a, Garrity v. New Jersey, 385 U.S. 493 (1967) (No. 66-13).  Initially, the
Attorney General or deputy attorney general was to investigate the irregularities and pre-
sent the evidence in an in camera hearing before a Master who was to prepare a report for
the Supreme Court. Id. at 4a, 7a. The court later amended its orders to allow the Attorney
HeinOnline -- 76 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 1352 2001

prosecutors  seek immunity orders in the hope of using the resulting
testimony for purposes other than prosecution of the immunized wit-
ness.185  Similarly, as a general matter, when internal affairs investiga-
tors  compel  statements  from  police  officers,  they do  so to further
noncriminal  disciplinary  investigations,  not  to  gather  evidence  for
prosecutions.186
Second, reliance  on the immunity analogy  avoids the above-de-
scribed  problems  with the  due  process  approach.  Perfectly  lawful
pressure, such as the threat of judicial contempt sanctions, can trigger
the protections of the privilege.  Thus, although the lawfulness of fir-
ing a police officer who refuses to answer questions undercuts a due
process claim for want of official misconduct,187 it is consistent with
treatment of the officer's answers as immunized.188
Third, application of the privilege is typically determined  based
solely on the nature of the threatened sanction, without assessment of
the surrounding circumstances.189  As a result, evidence that the state-
General or a deputy to file a report with the court without a hearing. Id. at 5a, 8a.  when
questioned at the hearing on the motion to suppress the statements, a deputy attorney
general assigned to the investigation testified that he had no power to arrest the suspects
and was not assigned to prosecute the case, but once he "was fairly certain offenses were in
fact committed... [he] knew that the Prosecutor's office would ultimately have it.T"r an-
script of Testimony Vol. 1, at 39-40, Garrity v. New Jersey, 385 U.S. 493 (1967) (No. 66-13).
185 Because the immunity grant bars use and derivative use of the immunized testimony,
it would be senseless for a prosecutor to immunize in order to develop a case against that
witness. Indeed, the immunity grant would impose potential obstacles to prosecution.  See
supra Part I.B.2. Not surprisingly, the Department of Justice requires that a federal prose-
cutor seeking to prosecute a previously immunized person for "offenses first disclosed in,
or closely related to," immunized testimony first receive written approval from the Attor-
ney General  U.S. Attorney's Manual § 9-23.400.  A request for approval to bring such a
prosecution must establish that the evidence to be used in the prosecution meets the re-
quirements of Kastigar. Id.
186 See supra note 13 and accompanying text (discussing internal police investigation
procedures).
187 See supra notes 150-55 and accompanying text.
188 Similarly, the privilege against self-incrimination is not driven by fear of unreliable
statements.  See Tehan v. United States ex rel. Shott, 382 U.S. 406,415 (1966) ("[Tlhe basic
purposes that lie behind the privilege against self-incrimination do not relate to protecting
the innocent from conviction....").  But see Amar & Lettow, supra note 38, at 859, 898-
901, 924-25 (contending that, properly construed, Fifth Amendment privilege should em-
body this concern).  Thus, the fact that there is little danger of a police officer falsely in-
criminating  himself when  compelled  to  answer  an  investigator's  questions does  not
undermine application of the privilege as a rationale for suppression.
189 See Donald Dripps, Is the Miranda Caselaw Really Inconsistent?  A Proposed Fifth
Amendment Synthesis, 17 Const. Comment. 19, 25 (2000) ("Fifth Amendment law gener-
ally, however, defines compulsion according to general categories rather than on a case-by-
case, totality-of-the-circumstances  approach.").  For example, the threat of a contempt
sanction for failure to comply with a subpoena is sufficient compulsion to trigger the privi-
lege without consideration of the penalty to be imposed for the contempt. See Stephen J.
Schulhofer, Reconsidering Miranda, 54 U. ChLi. L Rev. 435,443 (1987) (noting that threat

ments in Garrity were voluntary-such  as the suspects'  control  over
the location of interrogation and representation  by counsel-play no
role in the Fifth Amendment calculus. 90
Finally, by focusing on the Fifth Amendment privilege itself, ask-
ing whether the government has compelled statements that would in-
criminate the speaker, the immunity analogy is more persuasive  and
straightforward than the unconstitutional conditions doctrine.191
If the Fifth Amendment privilege better explains the outcome in
Garrity than due process or the unconstitutional conditions  doctrine,
why didn't the Garrity Court rely on it?  Before deciding Garrity, the
Court  had  determined  that  the  privilege  was  applicable  to  the
states,192 required suppression of statements resulting from "compul-
sion,"193 and could be triggered by compulsion imposed outside of for-
mal  legal  or  administrative  proceedings.194  It  would  have  been
consistent with these developments to conclude that the deputy attor-
ney general's threat of job termination was  sufficient compulsion to
trigger the privilege and render the resulting statements immunized.
The  Court may have  avoided relying on the Fifth Amendment
because it was unwilling to confer on the police officers the protection
that the privilege,  as then construed,  seemed  to require.  When the
Court  decided  Garrity,  the  prevailing  rule  of  Counselman  v.
Hitchcock195 required a grant of transactional immunity to supplant
the privilege.' 96  It was one thing to tell states, as the Court did, that
they could not both compel police officers'  statements and introduce
them at trial.  It would have been quite another to permit states to
conduct administrative questioning only if they were willing to forego
the possibility of subsequent prosecutions altogether.  Significantly, a
majority of the Court first characterized  the statements in Garrity as
"immunized"'197 the term after it decided Kastigar v.  United States,198
of $100 fine is sufficient to trigger Fifth Amendment privilege even if such penalty would
not render statement involuntary under due process approach).
190  "Our decisions make clear that the threat alone is sufficient to render all subsequent
testimony 'compelled."'  Minnesota v. Murphy, 465 U.S. 420, 445-46 (1984)  (Marshall, J.,
dissenting).

tions doctrine is neither sufficient nor necessary to explain Garrity).

C.  Suppression of Immunized Testimony and Coerced Confessions
The Court never has acknowledged that it supplanted the coerced
confession  approach  with the immunized  testimony  analogy  as  the
means  of explaining  the suppression  of compelled  statements.  Nor
has it recognized that the shift has significant consequences for judi-
cial  treatment  of  compelled  statements.  Indeed,  in  Kastigar, the
Court assumed that immunized testimony and coerced confessions re-
ceive the same amount of protection200  There is some merit to that
assumption.  Courts bar use of both coerced  confessions and immu-
nized testimony in the government's case-in-chief, prevent use of both
to impeach defendants, and exclude evidence that police discover by
exploiting both.20l  But while many lower courts interpret Kastigar to
prohibit  nonevidentiary  and  indirect  evidentiary  use of immunized
testimony as well,20  no court has imposed similar restrictions on use
of coerced confessions.203
199  Id. at 453.
200  Id. at 461-62; see also Humble, supra note 50, at 363 & n.72 (noting that Kastigar
Court likened immunized testimony to coerced confession and excluded both as compelled
incrimination).
Congress made the same assumption when it enacted the use immunity statute. See
Pillsbury Co. v. Conboy, 459 U.S. 248,276-78 (1983) (Blackmun, J., concurring in the judg-
ment) (reviewing statutory history and intent of use immunity statute).  The assumption
has been the subject of considerable criticism.  See, e.g., Kastigar, 406 U.S.  at 470-71
(Marshall, J.,  dissenting)  (arguing  that this  assumption  "turns  reason on  its head");
Strachan, supra note 50, at 823-32 (contrasting policies behind use immunity and immunity
from coerced confessions and arguing for different treatment of them); Murphy, supra note
53, at 1032 n.180 (citing authorities).
201  On the rules regarding coerced confessions, see Mincey v. Arizona, 437 U.S. 385,402
(1978)  (holding coerced  confession not admissible in case-in-chief or to impeach).  Al-
though the Supreme Court has never held that evidence derived from a coerced confession
should be suppressed as "fruit of the poisonous  tree," it likely would do so.  See,  e.g.,
Kastigar,4 06 U.S. at 470 (Marshall, J., dissenting) (describing need to suppress "the fruits
of the illegal search or interrogation"); Kamisar, supra note 148, at 990-1004 (contending
that "fruit of the poisonous tree" doctrine applies to evidence derived from coerced con-
fessions). But see Amar & Lettow, supra note 38, at 880-89 (arguing that evidence derived
from coerced confessions is admissible).
On the rules regarding immunized testimony, see supra notes 46-47 and accompanying
text.
202  See supra notes 49-57 and accompanying text (discussing courts' prohibition of pros-
ecution's nonevidentiary use of immunized testimony).
203  See United States v. Serrano, 870 F.2d 1, 18 (1st Cir. 1989) ("[N]o case involving a
coerced confession has prohibited the nonevidentiary use of an involuntary statement.");

The Kastigar Court's assumption of equivalent protection makes
clear that it did not anticipate that lower courts would afford greater
protection to immunized testimony than to coerced confessions.  But
although  the Court did not address it, there is some justification for
the differential treatment.  Significantly, both the Supreme Court and
lower courts use dissimilar rationales to justify suppression of immu-
nized  testimony  and  coerced  confessions.  The  differences  between
the rationales  can  explain why immunized  testimony receives  more
robust protection.2°4
Courts prohibit use of immunized testimony because the privilege
against  self-incrimination,  which  itself is  an  exclusionary  rule,  ex-
pressly requires that result.205  Consequently, judicial interpretation of
the scope of the privilege dictates the reach of the exclusionary rule,
such as  whether it precludes  nonevidentiary  or indirect  evidentiary
uses.206  Because Kastigar interpreted the privilege generously in the
context of formally immunized  testimony, the resulting exclusionary
rule is a robust one.  The language in Kastigard escribing the scope of
the privilege to require that the immunized witness be left "in substan-
tially the same position as if [he]  had claimed the Fifth Amendment
privilege"207 is the basis for the stringent restrictions  on noneviden-
tiary and indirect evidentiary uses.208
to coerced  confession); Humble, supra note 50, at 375 n.154 ("Outside of the immunity
context, no court has prohibited nonevidentiary uses of an involuntary statement.").
20  For a discussion of the development of the divergent approaches to immunized testi-
mony and coerced confessions, see Bloch, supra note 51, at 1608-48.
205 The privilege is an exclusionary rule, one that is violated when compelled testimony
is used at trial.  See, e.g., New York v. Quarles, 467 U.S. 649, 686 (1984)  (Marshall, J.,
dissenting) ("All the Fifth Amendment [privilege] forbids is the introduction  of coerced
statements at trial."); United States v. Hampton, 775 F.2d 1479, 1486 n.35 (11th Cir. 1985)

In contrast, courts  exclude confessions  in order to deter police
from  using  improper  coercion  when  questioning  suspects.209  Al-
though this deterrence rationale supports suppression of both coerced
confessions  and evidence  that police  and  prosecutors  derive by  ex-
ploiting them as "fruit of the poisonous tree, '210 deterrence-based ex-
clusionary sanctions are limited.  When applying the analogous Fourth
Amendment exclusionary rule, the Court has reasoned that if there is
only a tenuous causal connection between illegal police conduct and
derivative evidence, suppression of such "attenuated" evidence serves
little deterrent function and thus is unnecessary.211  When derivative
evidence involves an individual exercise of free will, such as witness
testimony or a defendant's  statement to police, rather than physical
evidence, the Court is more prone to find attenuation.212  Because the
Court's treatment of coerced confessions appears to resemble its ap-
tion of any use"' to argue that nonevidentiary use is prohibited (quoting Kastigar,4 06 U.S.
at 453, 460)).
209 See Colorado v. Connelly, 479 U.S. 157, 166 (1986) ("The purpose of excluding evi-
dence seized in violation of the Constitution [such as a coerced confession] is to substan-
tially deter future violations of the Constitution."). The focus on police misconduct as the
rationale for the suppression of coerced confessions  is a recent development.  See, e.g.,
Kamisar, supra note 148, at 936-41 (describing how in recent decades courts have "down-
played the unreliability of a coerced or 'involuntary'  confession" and instead focused on
"condemnation and deterrence of offensive police interrogation methods" as "a principal
reason for barring the resulting confessions"  (emphasis omitted)).
Because it is legal to grant immunity to a witness, the deterrence rationale plays no
role in suppression of immunized testimony. See Bloch, supra note 51, at 1641-42 (noting
that "a formal grant of immunity exemplifies the legally authorized means of compelling
testimony" and that deterrence rationale should therefore not apply "since  there is no
constitutional violation from which the government should be deterred").
210 See, e.g., Nix v. Williams, 467 U.S. 431, 442-43 (1984) ("The core rationale consist-
ently advanced by this Court for extending the exclusionary rule to evidence that is the
fruit of unlawful police conduct has been that this admittedly drastic and socially costly
course is needed to deter police from violations of constitutional and statutory protec-
tions."); see also supra note 201 and accompanying  text (addressing  question whether
"fruit of the poisonous tree" analysis applies to coerced confessions).
211 See, e.g., United States v. Ceccolini, 435 U.S. 268,280 (1978) (rejecting application of
exclusionary rule to attenuated evidence where it "could not have the slightest deterrent
effect on the behavior of an officer"); Nardone v. United States, 308 U.S. 338, 341 (1939)
("As a matter of good sense, however, such connection [between unconstitutional govern-
ment conduct and acquisition of evidence] may have become so attenuated as to dissipate
the taint."); 5 Wayne R. LaFave, Search & Seizure:  A Treatise on the Fourth Amendment
§ 11.4(a),  at 235-36  (1996)  (summarizing  development  of attenuation  jurisprudence);
Bloch, supra note 51, at 1638 ("At some point, the chain linking the illegality to the suspect
evidence  is so  convoluted  and strained,  suppression  is  unlikely  to deter  the  police
misconduct.").
212 See Ceccolini, 435 U.S. at 276-77 (finding that degree of exercise of free .ilbly 
witness is relevant factor); see also Rawlings v. Kentucky, 448 U.S. 98, 106-10 (1980) (find-
ing that "petitioner's statements were acts of free will unaffected by any illegality in the
initial detention" where statements were aplarently made spontaneously in response to
police discovery of drugs in petitioner's companion's possession).

proach to Fourth Amendment violations,213 this aspect of attenuation
doctrine  likely  applies  to  evidence  derived  from  coerced
214
confessions.
Thus, although courts interpret the privilege to require exclusion
of all evidence derived from immunized testimony, no matter how at-
tenuated,215 when applying the deterrence-based  "fruit of the poison-
ous tree" doctrine, they permit the introduction of derivative evidence
if it is sufficiently removed from the underlying illegality.216  Similarly,
courts do not consider whether the prosecution has made noneviden-
tiary use of a coerced  confession  or whether  witness testimony  has
been shaped or altered by  Indeed, it is routine for police officers,

investigators, and prosecutors to elicit, listen to, or read suspects' con-
fessions.  Even if a court later suppresses a confession as involuntary,
the prosecutor apparently remains free to make nonevidentiary use of
it and present witness  testimony that may have  been shaped  by it.
213 Like Fourth Amendment cases, the Court now deems police misconduct a prerequi-
site for suppression of a coerced confession, see supra note 209 and accompanying text,
and views "[ihe purpose of excluding evidence" as an attempt "to substantially deter fu-
ture violations of the Constitution."  Connelly, 479 U.S. at 166.  Indeed, in Connelly, the
Court cited Fourth Amendment cases when discussing  the rationale for suppressing co-
erced confessions.  See id. Yale Kamisar also has likened the Court's treatment of coerced
confessions to the suppression of evidence seized in violation of the Fourth Amendment.
See Kamisar, supra note 148, at 940 (arguing that "due process exclusionary rule for con-
fessions (in much the same way as the Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule for physical
evidence) is... intended to deter improper police conduct" (quoting 1 Wayne R. LaFave
& Jerold H. Israel, Criminal Procedure § 6.2, at 443 (1984))).
214 See, e.g., Mapys v. United States, 409 F.2d 964, 966 (10th Cir. 1969) (concluding that
attenuation  doctrine could  apply  to statements given after illegal  confession);  United
States v. Matthews, 488 F. Supp. 374, 379-80 n.2 (D. Neb. 1980) (suggesting that statement
that is fruit of illegal confession may be admissible if "any causal connection had become
so attenuated that the taint was dissipated").
215 In United States v. Kurzer, 534 F.2d 511 (2d Cir. 1976), the court rejected the appli-
cation of the attenuation doctrine to evidence derived from immunized testimony because:
The Fifth Amendment...  is by its terms an exclusionary rule, and as imple-
mented in the immunity statute it is a very broad one, prohibiting the use not
only of evidence, but of "information,"  "directly or indirectly derived"  from
the immunized testimony.  The statute requires not merely that the evidence
be excluded when such exclusion would deter wrongful police or prosecution
conduct, but that the witness be left "in substantially the same position as if
[he] had claimed the Fifth Amendment privilege."

Such  derivative  uses,  which  involve investigators,  prosecutors,  and
witnesses exercising free will, apparently  are too attenuated  to war-
rant suppression as fruit of the coerced confession.218
D.  The Need for Reform
Although the  above-described  steps in  the development  of the
Garrity rule-the shift to the immunity analogy and the increased pro-
tection that immunized testimony receives-are consistent with Fifth
218 Although these differences between treatment of immunized testimony and coerced
confessions are firmly entrenched in governing doctrine, there is reason to question them.
The Supreme Court has determined that, like due process, the privilege prohibits the use of
involuntary confessions.  See Dickerson v. United States, 530 U.S. 428, 433 (2000) ("Over
time, our cases recognized two constitutional bases for the requirement that a confession
be voluntary to be admitted into evidence:  the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimi-
nation and the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment."); Malloy v. Hogan,
378 U.S. 1, 6-11 (1964) (determining that Fifth Amendment privilege governs admissibility
of confessions in state criminal proceedings); Brain v. United States, 168 U.S. 532, 542-43
(1897)  (holding  that  privilege governs  admissibility  of confessions  in  federal  court);
Lawrence Herman, The Unexplored Relationship Between the Privilege Against Compul-
sory Self-Incrimination and the Involuntary Confession Rule (Part I),  53 Ohio St. LJ. 497,
529-50 (1992) (arguing that Fifth Amendment privilege prohibits use of involuntary confes-
sions). If so, coerced confessions merit no less legal protection than immunized testimony.
See Bloch, supra note 51, at 1619 ("If both [immunized testimony and coerced confessions]
receive their primary protection from the Self-Incrimination Clause, what justification pro-
vides for the disparate treatment of the two types of compelled utterances?").  But in
Connelly, without explicit consideration of these issues, the Court maintained that, despite
the availability of the privilege, it "has retained [a] due process focus" to address coerced
confessions.  Connelly, 479 U.S. at 163; see also Miller v. Fenton, 474 U.S. 104, 110 (1985)
("[E]ven after holding that the Fifth Amendment privilege against compulsory self-incrimi-
nation applies in the context of custodial interrogations, and is binding on the States, the
Court has continued to measure confessions against the requirements of due process." (in-
ternal citations omitted)).  Although the import of those passages  from Connelly and
Miller is not clear, they can be read to mandate that due process (which apparently permits
use of evidence derived from coerced confessions if sufficiently attenuated), not the privi-
lege (which does not exempt attenuated evidence), dictates the admissibility of allegedly
coerced confessions and their fruits, at least outside the special privilege-based rules set
forth in Miranda and its progeny.  See Herman, supra, at 521-28 (discussing Connelly's
implication that due process may determine admissibility of coerced confessions).  Indeed,
when assessing the admissibility of confessions, lower courts routinely rely on due process,
not the privilege.  See, e.g., United States v. McCurdy, 40 F.3d 1111, 1118 (10th Cir. 1994)
(holding that admissibility of statement taken in compliance with Miranda should be deter-
mined by application of due process voluntariness test); Weaver v. Brenner, 40 F.3d 527,
536 (2d Cir. 1994) ("[T]he  Supreme Court continues to analyze coercive interrogation
techniques under the Due Process Clause."); United States v. Swint, 15 F.3d 286, 289 (3d
Cir. 1994) (discussing application of due process test); People v. Sexton, 601 N.W.2d 399,
405 (Mich. Ct. App. 1999) (applying due process test), rev'd on other grounds, 609 N.W.2d
822 (Mich. 2000); State v. Bittick, 806 S.WV.2d 652,658 (Mo. 1991) (same); Passama v. State,
735 P.2d 321, 323 (Nev. 1987) ("The [C]ourt has retained this due process focus even after
developing extensive law on the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination and
applying it to the states.").  But see United States v. Braxton, 112 F.3d 777, 780 (4th Cir.
1997) (citing to both privilege and Due Process Clause as bases for suppressing coerced
confessions).

Amendment  doctrine,  the result-rigid  restrictions  on prosecutorial
use of police officers' compelled statements-is neither fair nor sensi-
ble.  Garrity immunity  saddles  prosecutors  with  the  obligation  to
disprove any use of compelled statements, often including noneviden-
tiary and indirect evidentiary use.219  Even when police internal affairs
investigators act in good faith, Garrity immunity can create  difficult,
sometimes insurmountable, impediments to investigations and prose-
cutions of police criminality.220  It also provides opportunities for sab-
otage by unscrupulous police investigators and witnesses.221  Unable
to  prevent  the  taking  and  dissemination  of compelled  statements,
prosecutors are powerless  to do more than attempt to minimize the
adverse consequences of Garrity immunity and prepare to satisfy their
burden at a Kastigar hearing.  These responses,  which are only par-
tially effective,  require the expenditure  of considerable  resources  to
identify and isolate tainted witnesses and evidence.222
Police prosecutions face unique  and formidable challenges:  the
"code of silence,"223  citizens' reluctance  to make complaints against
police,224 prosecutors'  aversion to bringing charges  against members
of police  departments with which theyr  must maintain  working rela-
tionships,225  the  prevalence  of one-on-one  "swearing  contests"  be-
tween  single  complainants  and  police  officers,226  the  questionable
credibility of many complainants and witnesses, the difficulty in deter-
219  The use restrictions unique to immunized  testimony and, by analogy, to police of-
ficers' compelled statements-the prohibitions on nonevidentiary and indirect evidentiary
uses-are the most problematic. The proscription on nonevidentiary use requires that an
exposed prosecutor refrain from decisionmaking influenced by compelled statements.  Be-
cause strategic and tactical decisions are likely the result of all information available to a
prosecutor, it may be difficult or impossible for a prosecutor to determine whether, and to
what extent, her exposure to a compelled statement tainted that process.  This is particu-
larly true when the exposure occurs early in the investigation. The ban on indirect eviden-
tiary use makes avoidance of exposure and taint contingent on witnesses whose conduct
and thought processes are beyond the prosecution's control.

mining when police use of force becomes criminalP 7 and the fact that
jurors and judges are often sympathetic to police defendants.=s  Ad-
ding Garrity immunity makes  a  difficult  situation  worse  and  may
cause prosecutors either to forego or lose othenvise meritorious cases
against police officers who commit crimes.229  Because it enables po-
lice investigators  to grant the functional equivalent of formal immu-
nity to other officers, the Garrity doctrine is difficult to square with
judicial efforts to limit the availability of immunity in other contexts.
Most notably, absent a request from the prosecution,  courts stead-
fastly have  refused to grant immunity  for witnesses  who, if immu-
nized,  would  provide  exculpatory  testimony  for  criminal
defendants?3 o
The contrast between the protection that courts provide for co-
erced  confessions  and compelled  statements  also is  troubling.P1  In
the former situation, police bent on solving a crime use illegal physical
or psychological pressure to coerce a possibly unreliable  confession
from an uncounseled in-custody suspect in the secrecy of an interroga-
tion room.  In the latter, internal affairs investigators conduct a civil,
administrative  interview of a suspect police  officer, affording him  a
host of procedural protections, including representation by counsel or
227 See, e.g., Carl B. Klockars, A Theory of Excessive Force and Its Control, in Police
Violence, supra note 8, at 1, 2 ("The enormous range of the legitimate authority of the
police to use force is at the heart of the problem of defining and controlling its excessive
use.").
See id. at 3 (describing public reluctance to punish police officers "with penalties
M8 
normally reserved for criminals"); supra note 119 (citing authority describing judicial atti-
tudes in police prosecutions).
229 See supra Part II.C.
230 See, e.g., Amar & Lettow, supra note 38, at 862-64, 863 n.15 (noting that courts have
refused to grant immunity to witnesses who, if immunized, would give self-incriminating
testimony that would exculpate criminal defendants); Peter W. Tague, The Fifth Amend-
ment  If an Aid to the Guilty Defendant, an Impediment to the Innocent One, 78 Geo.
LJ.1 , 1 (1989) (noting that privilege can "shackle the innocent defendant from attempting
to prove that another person committed the crime"); see also Pillsbury Co. v. Conboy, 459
U.S. 248,261 (1983) (noting in context of civil deposition that "[nlo court has authority to
immunize a witness. That responsibility... is peculiarly an executive one").
231 See supra  notes 202-03  and accompanying  text  (discussing differences).  Several
scholars have noted the apparent anomaly that coerced confessions receive less protection
than  immunized  testimony.  See  Herman,  supra  note 218,  at 525  n.661  (discussing
"irony... that a counselled [and immunized] witness at a televised legislative hearing into
matters of national significance [i.e., Oliver North] was given more protection than a sus-
pect isolated with an interrogator at the police station"); Strachan, supra note 50, at 823-30
("The so-called 'immunity'  inadvertently conferred  by an unconstitutional interrogation
cannot properly be compared with statutory immunity.").  Courts also have commented on
the differences.  See, e.g., United States v. Kurzer, 534 F.2d 511, 515-17 (2d Cir. 1976)
(distinguishing Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule, which focuses on deterring unlawful
police conduct, from Fifth Amendment exclusionary rule, which confers broad prohibition
on use of immunized testimony against witness).

gives prosecutors free rein to use coerced  confessions, but not com-
pelled  statements,  to  determine  trial  strategy  and  shape  witness
testimony.Z33
As one observer has noted, the Garrity "status quo... is contrary
to fundamental tenets of our system of justice" and conflicts with "the
need to hold those who wear the public trust accountable in the same
system of criminal justice that they enforce and to which the rest of us
subscribe.''234  Although the desire for more effective  criminal prose-
cution of police officers  alone cannot justify diminution of their con-
stitutional rights,  these problems  make clear that the constitutional
and  legislative  framework  supporting  Garrity immunity  is  ripe  for
reconsideration.
III
RESPONSES TO  GARRITY  IMMUNITY PROBLEMS
A.  Judicial Responses
1.  Rethinking Garrity
One  approach  to reform is  to reassess  Garrity. Should  official
threats of job loss made to a government employee  as a sanction for
silence  trigger  the  privilege  against self-incrimination?  Building  on
the claim that "[n]othing in the historical development of the privilege
suggests that threatened loss of employment was the kind of compul-
sion against which the [Fifth] amendment aimed to protect,''235 some
232 See, e.g., Cal. Gov't Code § 3303 (West 1995) (describing procedural rights of police
officers during administrative questioning to include receiving compensation if questioned
while off-duty, questioning by no more than two interrogators, receiving copy of transcript
and recording of interview if one is made, retaining ability to make own recording of the
interview, receiving advance notice of nature of investigation, and retaining representa-
tion); see also Lisa  Petrillo, Woman Is Dead; Police-Shootings Debate  Lives On, S.D.
Union-Trib., Aug. 10, 1993, at B1, 1993 WL 7503947 (describing ability of police officers
suspected of improper shootings to confer with attorneys before questioning).
233  See supra note 203 and accompanying text (noting that courts do not apply restric-
tions  on  nonevidentiary  and  indirect  evidentiary  uses  in  cases  involving  coerced
confessions).
Of course, one response to this disparity in treatment is to increase the protection that
coerced confessions receive.  Indeed, some reasons offered for the greater protection for
immunized testimony are unpersuasive.  See infra note 258 (responding to policy argu-
ments that immunized testimony merits more protection than coerced confessions).  But
see supra Part II.C (describing differences between rationales for suppression of coerced
confessions and immunized testimony).  Whatever the merits of that position, a topic be-
yond the scope of this Article, there is no evidence that courts are inclined to prohibit
nonevidentiary and indirect evidentiary uses of coerced confessions.

scholars have called for Garrity to be overruled.P6  Noting that Gar-
rity has no application when private employers use similar threats to
investigate employee  misconduct,27  they conclude  that Garrity im-
pairs  the  government's  ability  to  function  like  a  responsible  em-
ployer238 and bestows on government employees rights not shared by
those in the private sector.239  Thus, the critics reason, Garrity sets the
"compulsion"  threshold  too low:  Threats of job termination  should
not trigger the privilege, and police officers'  resulting answers should
be admissible.24°
The Court should be hesitant to adopt this view.  First, it over-
states both the impediments to the government as an employer and
the  advantages  that government  employees  enjoy.  Garrity and  its
progeny leave the government as free as private employers to demand
answers to job-related questions from employees on pain of job termi-
nation.241 Although Garrity may foreclose the government from using
statements that it compels from its employees in a criminal prosecu-
tion, private  employers  are under no obligation  to notify police  or
prosecutors  about similar statements that they compel from employ-
ees. Without such notice, government employees and private employ-
ees stand in roughly the same position-both can be required to make
statements that either cannot be (in the case of government employ-
ees) or likely will not be (in the case of private employees)  used in
criminal prosecutions.242
236 See, e.g., Amar & Lettow, supra note 38, at 868-69, 905-06 (proposing that gover-
ment should be able to fire employees "without detriment to its law enforcement func-
tion"); Friendly, supra note 164, at 706-08 (arguing that public employees' answers should
be admissible even if compelled by threat of job loss).
237 See Amar & Lettow, supra note 38, at 868-69 (noting that unlike "[a]  responsible
private employer [who] may draw sensible inferences from silence and fire [employees]
who refuse[ ] to respond to accusations," government can do so only if it confers immunity
and risks loss of evidence of criminal wrongdoing); Friendly, supra note 164, at 707 (com-
paring  Garrity to  situation  in  which  private  employer  makes  similar  inquiry  into
misconduct).
238  See Amar & Lettow, supra note 38, at 905 (noting that government is currently
forced to choose between "act[ing] sensibly as an employer" and "act[ing] efficiently in its
sovereign capacity as a law enforcer").
239 See Friendly, supra note 164, at 707 ("It thus seems morally wrong that if [public
employees] opt for answering questions in order to protect their jobs, their answers should
enjoy greater protection than those of an employee responding to a similar inquiry by a
private employer.").
240 Id. at 708 n.158 ("I propose a return to the pre-Garrity... world, in which the nation
lived quite happily without giving... public officials...  a super first-class citizenship.").
241 See supra notes 151-53, 167-70 and accompanying text (discussing ability of govern-
ment to demand answers to job-related questions from public employees and fire them if
they refuse).
242 There are two significant Garrity-generated differences between treatment of pri-
vate- and public-sector employees. First, if the government learns of a private-sector em-
HeinOnline -- 76 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 1363 2001
Imaged with the Permission of N.Y.U. Law ReviewNEW YORK  UNIVERSITY  LAW REVIEW [Vol. 76:1309
Second, absent the Garrity doctrine or something like it, the gov-
ernment, which  investigates  and prosecutes as  well as  employs,  can
impose unique obligations on its employees.  Without Garrity, crimi-
nal investigators  and prosecutors  could use the threat  of job loss  to
compel statements  from government employees suspected  of job-re-
lated crimes, not to impose workplace discipline, but for the purpose
of criminal  investigation  and prosecution.243  Police  and prosecutors
cannot exercise the same leverage over private-sector employees sus-
pected of crimes.  Thus, abolition of Garrity would impose unique re-
strictions  on  public  employees'  ability  to  exercise  their  Fifth
Amendment rights.
The Court could address this disparity by permitting prosecutors
to introduce only those compelled statements elicited during noncrim-
inal investigations.  But it is difficult, if not impossible, to interpret the
privilege  against self-incrimination  to support such a rule.  The gov-
ernment's threat of job loss seems to be equally "compelling" whether
it comes during an administrative  or a criminal investigation.2,14  In-
deed, when compared to the kind of judicial compulsion clearly suffi-
ployee's compelled statement, it can introduce it in a criminal case.  Garrity would bar use
of an analogous statement from a government employee.  Second, dissemination of a pri-
vate employee's compelled statement does not pose the risk of tainting a prosecution as
does dissemination of a government employee's compelled statement. There are, however,
less drastic means  of eliminating  or minimizing these differences  than abolition  of the
Garrity rule.  See infra Parts III.A.2 and III.B (suggesting alternatives).
243  Indeed, this happened in Garrity. After the deputy attorney general interviewed
Garrity and the other suspects, an assistant county prosecutor, whose office later brought
and prosecuted the criminal charges, also interviewed them. State v. Naglee, 207 A.2d 689,
692 (N.J. 1965). The state forfeiture statute required Garrity and the others to answer the
prosecutor's questions.  At trial, the defendants'  statements to both the deputy attorney
general and the district attorney were admitted into evidence.  Id. at 692, 696-97.
244 Although the Court has carved out exceptions to the privilege in noncriminal, regu-
latory contexts, those decisions do not support a rule permitting introduction of statements
compelled during administrative investigations of police conduct and excluding statements
compelled during criminal investigations.  First, "[t]he Court has on several occasions rec-
ognized that the Fifth Amendment privilege may not be invoked to resist compliance with
a regulatory regime constructed to effect the State's public purposes unrelated to the en-
forcement of its criminal laws." Balt. City Dep't of Soc. Servs. v. Bouknight, 493 U.S. 549,
556 (1990).  But in doing so, the Court addressed only the ability of the state to compel
statements, not whether the prosecution can later use the statements in a criminal case.
See id. at 561 (suggesting that person who complies with regulatory requirement by giving
testimonial evidence may be entitled to "limitations on the direct and indirect use of that
testimony").
Second, the Court has refused to apply the privilege altogether-thus permitting both
governmental compulsion to obtain statements and later use in a prosecution-when the
information is necessary for the operation of a noncriminal regulatory scheme, and there is
little chance that the required disclosures, taken as a whole, will result in criminal prosecu-
tion. See, e.g., California v. Byers, 402 U.S. 424 (1971) (holding that state statute requiring
automobile driver involved in accident to stop and self-identify did not trigger privilege).
Because there is a fair possibility that police officers' statements regarding alleged miscon-
HeinOnline -- 76 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 1364 2001
Imaged with the Permission of N.Y.U. Law ReviewNovember 2001] GARRTY  IMMUNITY
cient to trigger the privilege-the possibility of a contempt sanction
for refusal to answer  questions-the threat  used in  Garrity can be
considerably more daunting.245  Many employees would prefer a con-
tempt conviction, a fine, and a short jail sentence to the loss of their
chosen  employment and perhaps their pension and career.246  If the
threat of a contempt  sanction is enough to activate  the privilege,  it
seems that the threat in  Garrity is sufficient as well,  whether made
during an administrative or criminal investigation.
In addition,  if the government  were able to terminate  a police
officer's employment for his assertion of the right to avoid self-incrim-
ination, in effect forcing a waiver of the privilege, it may be able to
condition  other  government-sponsored  economic  benefits,  such  as
housing  subsidies  and  health care  funding, on  similar waivers.  To
some,  the public interest may demand  that police officers,  who are
vested with the responsibility of upholding the law and given the legal
right to use force, be held to answer for alleged misconduct under pain
of losing their jobs  and without receiving  immunity.247  But if eco-
nomic pressure is a permissible means of compelling waivers of consti-
tutional safeguards  in that setting, the government's ability to make
similar demands on others who also  are financially  dependent on it
may be enhanced.  For example, it may be permissible for the govern-
ment to require a waiver of constitutional rights as a condition of resi-
dence in publicly funded housing.248
2.  Rethinking the Formal Immunity Analogy
Even if Garrity remains intact, it need not require that courts af-
ford police officers'  compelled statements the same stringent protec-
tion  that formally  immunized  testimony  receives.  Even  a  modest
duct will expose them to criminal prosecution, Byers likely has no force in the Garrity
context.
245 See, e.g., Lefkowitz v. Cunningham, 431 U.S. 801, 806 (1977)  (noting that -touch-
stone" of Fifth Amendment privilege is compulsion, and sanctions involving "substantial
economic impact" trigger protections); Spevack v. Klein, 385 U.S. 511,516 (1967) (describ-
ing "[tjhe threat of disbarment and the loss of professional standing, professional reputa-
tion, and of livelihood" as "powerful forms of compulsion to make a law.yer relinquish the
privilege" and as "powerful an instrument of compulsion"  as use of legal process).
246 See Friendly, supra  note 164,  at 707  (noting  "that from  a practical  standpoint
threatened loss of a government job carrying valuable vested benefits or suspension from a
profession may be a more effective compulsion than a small fine or even a few days in
jail").
247 For a discussion of an approach to cases like Garrity using such a cost-benefit analy-
sis, see Bloch, supra note 51, at 1665-72.
248 See, e.g., Monica L  Selter, Comment, Sweeps:  An Unwarranted Solution to the
Search for Safety in Public Housing, 44 Am. U. L Rev. 1903, 1938-40 (1995) (describing
tension between Clinton Administration policy of including consent-to-search clauses in
leases of federally subsidized housing and Garrihy decision).

relaxation of prohibitions on collateral uses of compelled statements
would markedly improve the prospects of prosecutions of police of-
ficers.  For example, courts  could treat compelled  statements as they
do coerced confessions, barring use of the statement itself in the pros-
ecution's case-in-chief  and for impeachment  and suppressing nonat-
tenuated  evidence  derived  from it, but imposing no prohibition  on
nonevidentiary use or indirect evidentiary use through witness testi-
mony.249  This approach, which is consistent with the assumptions un-
derlying the Court's decisions in Garrity and Kastigar2,50 would free
prosecutors from the burden of demonstrating  that neither they nor
their witnesses had been exposed to or tainted by police officers' com-
pelled statements.25'  It also would eliminate the threat of police wit-
nesses' avoiding their obligation to testify by claiming to be tainted.252
Indeed, justifications for the robust protection of immunized tes-
timony do not apply  to the compelled  statements  of police  officers.
Professor  Kristine  Strachan,  an  advocate  of  strict  limits  on
prosecutorial  use  of  immunized  testimony,253  defended  heightened
protection  for  immunized  testimony  by  comparing  the  process  of
questioning  a suspect  with that of immunizing  a witness.  She  con-
tended that coerced  confessions deserve less protection because they
often result from hasty interrogation decisions made "under pressure,
often inadvertently..,  by persons unaware of or not concerned with
legal consequences.'' 4  The sanction of preclusion attaches only after
12
a court later determines that such "constable's blunders"  violate due
process.255  In contrast,  decisions  to immunize  witnesses  "are  made
before interrogation, normally by lawyers, acting with sufficient time
to decide, calmly and rationally, whether it is more valuable to compel
the testimony and suffer the resulting use preclusion or to forego the
testimony and retain the unfettered ability to prosecute. 256  Professor

exposure would not present a problem,  unless it led to the discovery of evidence.  See

Strachan also maintained  that, unlike police officers, who only learn
after a suppression ruling that a confession is  coerced, prosecutors,
who make the decision to immunize, will know that they must take
steps in advance to ensure that they later will be able to establish that
there was no use of immunized testimony.257  Finally, she noted that
"grants  of immunity probably occur much less frequently"  than co-
s8
erced confessions.Z
These points lose force when applied to police officers' compelled
statements rather than formally immunized testimony.  Indeed, all of
the reasons that Strachan gives for affording less protection to coerced
confessions-the possible inadvertence of the conduct triggering sup-
pression  of evidence,  the concerns  for attaching too harsh a conse-
quence  to  "blunders,"  the  prosecution's  inability  to  prepare  in
257 Id.
258 Id. Strachan's effort to distinguish between coerced confessions and immunized tes-
timony is not altogether persuasive.  Police officers who seek confessions may be neither
ignorant of, nor apathetic about, the legal consequences of their tactics.  See, e.g., Cooper
v. Dupnick, 963 F.2d 1220, 1223-24 (9th Cir. 1992) (describing plan employed by officers
involved in serial rapist investigation to ignore suspect's assertions of rights to silence and
legal counsel in hopes of obtaining statement  that could be  used to impeach, thereby
preventing suspect from testifying at trial).  Indeed, the exclusionary rule presupposes that
police officers make informed decisions about interrogation tactics that can be influenced
by suppression.  See Colorado v. Connelly, 479 U.S. 157, 166 (1986) (holding that purpose
of suppressing  coerced confessions  "is  to substantially  deter future violations  of the
Constitution").
Similarly, Strachan's use of the well-known Fourth Amendment  term  "constable's
blunders" to describe the cause of a coerced confession is misplaced. Although police may
not know exactly how much pressure will prompt a court to find a confession to be invol-
untary, they are aware that at some point coercive tactics will result in suppression. 'Thus,
as they increase the pressure to elicit a statement, they cannot help but be aware that they
tread on thin ice.  is stands in marked contrast to police officers who are either unaware
of or baffled by Fourth Amendment doctrine, that "vast jumble of judicial pronounce-
ments that is not merely complex and contradictory, but often perverse."  Akhl  Reed
Amar,F ourth Amendment First Principles, 107 Harv. L Rev. 757, 758 (1994).  Thus, the
case for allowing collateral uses when police coerce a confession is less compelling than
when they inadvertently run afoul of the intricacies of the Fourth Amendment.
Even if Strachan's characterization of differences between the processes of coercing
confessions and immunizing testimony is accurate, however, it is not self-evident that those
differences should cause courts to apply a less robust exclusionary rule for coerced confes-
sions.  If police  engage in conduct sufficiently  egregious  to violate due process,  there
should be little judicial sympathy for claims that police often must act hastily or under
pressure, are ignorant of, or apathetic about, the legal consequences of their conduct, or
normally do not take steps to minimize the consequences flowing from a coerced confes-
sion. Indeed, one plausibly could contend that the need to deter police misconduct, espe-
cially  misconduct  sufficiently  flagrant  to  violate  due  process,  requires  use  of  an
exclusionary rule as robust as the one applied to immunized testimony. The danger that
such misconduct will increase the risk of unreliable confessions, and thus wrongful convic-
tions, lends further support to that contention.  By requiring the prosecution to disprove all
use of coerced confessions,  including nonevidentiary and indirect evidentiary use, courts
could increase the incentive for police to refrain from use of offensive interrogation tactics.

advance for the fallout of such blunders, and the greater frequency
with which the prosecution will have to contend with the problem-
apply with equal force to statements compelled from police officers.259
Nor does resort to the Fifth Amendment  privilege as the reason
for suppression  and the related use  of the "immunity"  label require
that  courts  treat  compelled  statements  and  immunized  testimony
identically.  As Professor Bloch has demonstrated, the Court employs
a multitiered  approach  to  the Fifth Amendment  privilege,  affording
different levels of protection in different circumstances.260  For exam-
ple, when a defendant testifies at a pretrial suppression hearing to es-
tablish standing, the Court recognizes  a limited privilege-based form
of "'use  immunity"' 261 that bars  admission of the testimony  in the
prosecution's case-in-chief at trial, but may permit impeachment  and
nonevidentiary use.262  And, although  Bloch does  not discuss it, the
privilege-based Miranda exclusionary rule,263 which requires suppres-
sion of statements  taken either without proper warnings or following
police failure to  honor a suspect's invocation  of rights,  but permits
collateral uses that are prohibited  of immunized  testimony,264 is an-
259 See supra Part I.C (discussing circumstances surrounding internal affairs investiga-
tors' use of compulsion to take statements from suspect police officers).
260 Bloch, supra  note 51,  at 1646-48.  Professor Bloch  describes  three tiers of Fifth
Amendment protection.  Formally immunized testimony (Tier One) receives the most ro-
bust protection, a prohibition on direct and derivative evidentiary use, as well as at least
some nonevidentiary use.  Coerced  confessions (Tier TWo)  enjoy protection from direct
and derivative evidentiary use, but not from nonevidentiary use.  Statements made as a
result of the need to choose between constitutional rights-specifically, a criminal defen-
dant's pretrial suppression hearing testimony necessary to establish standing to contest the
legality of a search or seizure (Tier Three)-are excluded  only from use in the prosecu-
tion's case-in-chief.  Id.; see also Bloch, supra note 11,  at 640-64  (surveying spectrum of
protection under rubric of "use immunity").  Bloch argues that the Court has acknowl-
edged, at least implicitly, that the Fifth Amendment privilege provides different levels of
protection in different contexts.  See Bloch, supra note 51, at 1645-46.
261  United States v. Salvucci, 448 U.S. 83, 90 (1980).
262 See id. at 93-94 & nn.7-8 (implicitly rejecting prohibition on nonevidentiary use and
leaving intact lower court decisions permitting use of suppression hearing testimony to
impeach defendant at trial); Simmons v. United States, 390 U.S. 377, 393-94 (1968) (hold-
ing that defendant's suppression hearing testimony to establish standing "may not thereaf-
ter be admitted against him at trial on the issue of guilt," thus suggesting it could be used to
impeach or discover other evidence (emphasis added)).  For a discussion of the Court's
subsequent interpretation of Simmons, see Bloch, supra note 51, at 1620-23, 1634-35.
263 The Court recently reiterated that the Fifth Amendment serves as the foundation for
the Miranda rule.  See Dickerson v. United States, 530 U.S. 428, 434-35 (2000).
264 Prosecutors can use statements taken in violation of Miranda to impeach a defen-
dant, see Oregon v. Hass, 420 U.S. 714, 722-24 (1975) (holding statement obtained follow-
ing failure to honor invocation of right to counsel admissible to impeach); Harris v. New
York, 401  U.S. 222, 223-26 (1971)  (holding statement obtained  after defective Miranda
warnings admissible to impeach), and develop leads to other evidence, see, for example,

ment following Miranda warning was admissible without consideration  of possible taint

other example.  Courts can and should show the same flexibility when
determining  whether  to permit  collateral  uses  of  compelled  state-
ments, particularly in light of the significant differences between for-
mal grants of immunity and Garrity immunity.265
B.  Legislative Responses
For policymakers, the situations in which  Garrity immunity  at-
taches involve three competing concerns:  the suspect officers'  Fifth
Amendment rights, the need for effective administrative investigation
from defendant's  previous statements made without having received warnings, since "a
procedural Miranda violation differs in significant respects from violations of the Fourth
Amendment, which have...  mandated a broad application of the 'fruits' doctrine"); Carol
S. Steiker, Counter-Revolution in Constitutional  Criminal Procedure?  Twro Audiences,
Two Answers, 94 Mich. L. Rev. 2466, 2523-24 (1996)  (noting that lower courts have read
Elstad "to mean that Miranda violations simply produce no suppressible 'fruits' at all").
265 See supra Part I.C (describing differences).  Professor Bloch proposes two models
for determining the appropriate level of protection available for various forms of com-
pelled statements, a "Compulsion Model," Bloch, supra note 51, at 1651-64, and a "Balanc-
ing Model,"  id. at 1665-72.  The former "posits  a correlation  between  the extent of
compulsion and the extent of protection:  the greater the compulsion, the greater the pro-
tection."  Id. at 1651.  The latter "weighs the pertinent governmental interests against the
speaker's privilege...."  Id. at 1665.  When Bloch applies the models to compelled state-
ments taken from police officers as part of an administrative investigation, she concludes
that they merit less protection than immunized testimony but more protection than co-
erced confessions.  Id. at 1693-1700.  She concludes that her models would permit at least
some nonevidentiary use of police officers' compelled statements.  Id. at 1695, 1698.
Even if reluctant to apply less stringent exclusionary rules to compelled statements,
courts could reallocate the burden of proof regarding some collateral uses.  For a discus-
sion of a similar approach in the context of congressional immunity, see Wright, supra note
36, at 445-48.  The Kastigar Court's decision to make the prosecution shoulder the burden
of disproving taint makes sense when it is the prosecutor who chooses to immunize a wit-
ness and later to prosecute.  In such a situation, the prosecutor can weigh the benefits of
immunity against the costs, employ prophylactic measures such as "canning" testimony
before granting immunity, and take steps to avoid dissemination of the immunized testi-
mony.  See supra notes 76-77, 82, 87-88 and accompanying text.  As noted above, none of
these things is true of Garrity statements.  See supra notes 78,83-86,89-91 and accompany-
ing text.
If the prosecution can demonstrate that it has played no role in the decision to confer
Garrity immunity and disseminate a compelled statement, courts could reallocate the bur-
den by requiring that the defendant prove witness taint, particularly if there is reason to
doubt the sincerity of an allegedly tainted witness.  See supra notes 97-112 and accompany-
ing text. Although such a shift would not alleviate all the problems that Garrity immunity
creates, it would reduce the threat of witness sabotage, enabling courts to reject witnesses'
incredible claims of taint, even if the prosecution was unable to affirmatively establish an
absence of taint. It would make sense to continue to allocate to the prosecution the bur-
den of proving that prosecutors, investigators, and physical evidence are free from taint.
Despite the prosecution's inability to control the decisions to take and disseminate a com-
pelled statement, the prosecution team can ensure that its own members remain free from
exposure.  The prosecution also has better access to information concerning the prosecu-
tion team's exposure to and taint by compelled statements for purposes of a Kastigarh ear-
ing than does the defendant police officer who gave the Garrity statement.

and discipline of police misconduct, and the need to preserve the op-
tion of criminally prosecuting rogue officers.266  Generous interpreta-
tion of the privilege in the Garrity context and the practice of taking
compelled  statements  from police  officers  before  prosecution  favor
the first two concerns  at the expense  of the third.267  Although it is
impossible to eliminate the tension between the concerns entirely, leg-
islators or police department policymakers should minimize the threat
to prosecutions without infringing on officers'  rights or impairing the
administrative discipline process to the extent that they can do so.  At
least  three approaches  are possible:  (1) controlling  the  decision  to
take compelled  statements; (2) restricting  the dissemination of com-
pelled  statements;  and  (3)  using less  coercive  methods  to  persuade
suspect officers  to cooperate with internal affairs investigations.
1.  Controlling the Decision to Take Compelled Statements
Professor Bloch has proposed a "notice  and veto" mechanism as
a legislative response  to the Garrity predicament-requiring  that in-
ternal  affairs  investigators  obtain  prosecutorial  approval  to compel
statements.268  Before taking a compelled  statement, the "internal af-
fairs units provide  notice to the requisite prosecuting  authorities  of
their  intention  to  [do  so]."'269  After  receipt  of  that  notice,
"[p]rosecuting  authorities then would have a limited period in which
to submit an objection to the taking of the statement. 27T0  An objec-
tion would preclude internal affairs from taking the statement.271 Pro-
fessor  Bloch  acknowledges  that  this  response  may  impair
administrative  investigations  by  denying  investigators  a  statement
from suspect police officers  in cases when prosecutors  exercise their
veto, but suggests that this burden is not prohibitive.272
266  See Bloch, supra note 11, at 628 ("The tripartite goals of 'use immunity' are to: (1)
protect the accused's Fifth Amendment right, (2) secure information from the accused, and
(3) preserve accountability in the justice system."); see also Pillsbury Co. v. Conboy, 459
U.S. 248, 257-58 (1983) (identifying interests of party seeking to assert Fifth Amendment
privilege; information was sought for purpose other than criminal prosecution).
267 Not all police departments take and disseminate compelled statements before there
has been a criminal investigation.  See supra note 72.  But the decision to forego adminis-
trative questioning altogether or delay it pending a determination  whether there will be
prosecution reduces the efficacy of the internal disciplinary option.  See infra notes 274,

For this approach to properly balance the competing needs of in-
ternal affairs investigators for compelled statements  and prosecutors
to maintain the possibility of viable prosecutions, prosecutors would
have to be able to assess the probability of future criminal prosecution
accurately  when deciding  whether to exercise a veto.  Ideally, they
would veto  compelled statements  only when later criminal  prosecu-
tion is  likely.  If they  under-vetoed,  Garrity immunity  still  would
plague prosecutions; if they over-vetoed, they would deny administra-
tive  investigations  important  evidence.  Unfortunately,  practical
problems likely would undermine the predictive accuracy necessary to
make this proposal attractive.
First, internal affairs investigators might provide incomplete no-
tice.  At the minimum, they would have to notify at least two or three
different prosecutors-the local  district attorney, the state Attorney
General, and the United States Attorney-all of whom may have ju-
risdiction to bring criminal charges that Garrity immunity could jeop-
ardize.273  Otherwise, they may neglect to notify a prosecutor who, if
alerted, would veto the compelled statement.
Second, the content of the notice may be inadequate.  Investiga-
tors may want to elicit officers' statements at the outset of an investi-
gation,  before  suspect  officers  have  an  opportunity  to  "get  their
stories straight."  Thus, they may seek approval to compel statements
before developing sufficient evidence to enable prosecutors  to make
intelligent decisions about whether to exercise a veto.  The delay nec-
essary to provide more information may render the statement less val-
uable because of witness collusion.274  Being forced to make decisions
without full knowledge of the facts may cause prosecutors to author-
ize compelled statements in cases in which they would exercise a veto
had they received a fuller account.
without a pretrial statement or trial testimony from a defendant. Id.  For a response to that
view, see infra note 280.
273 Indeed, in the case upon which Bloch relies for her proposal, Daly v. Superior Court,
560 P.2d 1193 (Cal. 1977) (en banc), in which the California Supreme Court employed a
notice-and-veto procedure to determine whether a trial court should grant use immunity to
allow questioning in a civil suit, "the court mandated that the litigants notify the 'district
attorney of the county, the California Attorney General, and the United States Attorney
for the district in which the county is located."'  Bloch, supra note 11, at 683 (quoting Daly,
560 P.2d at 1204).  Because police criminality may cross local jurisdictional boundaries,
internal affairs investigators sometimes would have to notify prosecutors in several local,
state, and federal jurisdictions.
274 See, e.g., U.S. Comm'n on Civil Rights, supra note 6, ch. 4 (criticizing New York
Police Department rule requiring forty-eight-hour delay before internal affairs investiga-
tors can question suspect police officers because it "creates opportunities for subject of-
ficers to corroborate their versions of the alleged misconduct incident").

The mixed motives  that some  internal  affairs investigators may
harbor could exacerbate  these notice problems.  For the same reasons
that police investigators  may improperly compel a statement or dis-
seminate a compelled statement,275 they may neglect to notify a con-
cerned prosecutor or provide incomplete or misleading information in
hopes of avoiding a veto, permitting them to confer Garrity immunity
and thwart criminal prosecution.276  Because it would be difficult to
prove that failure to provide complete and accurate notice was done
in bad faith, and because sanctions to deter such conduct would not
salvage a criminal prosecution impaired by the taking of a compelled
statement,  these  problems  make  the  notice-and-veto  solution
unattractive.
Moreover, prosecutors may over-veto, thus impairing the internal
administrative disciplinary process.277  A prosecutor's cost-benefit as-
sessment heavily favors vetoes, even when inappropriate.  An unwar-
ranted veto may  deny an  internal  affairs investigator  an  important
source of evidence, but imposes no direct costs on the prosecutor.278
Prosecutors' suspicions that internal affairs investigators, for whatever
reason, are not providing complete details, will exacerbate this prob-
lem.  The safe  thing for a prosecutor to do is to veto, particularly if
forced to make a decision quickly.279  If prosecutors are given time to

The deputy district attorneys [in Los Angeles County] stressed other ways in
which investigations can be manipulated.  A deputy district attorney who has

at the scene of the shooting or later when he or she attempts to follow up.
Deputy district attorneys state that passive noncooperation,  delays, mix-ups,
unavailability of personnel and other similar tactics by the Sheriff's Depart-
ment can severely prejudice an investigation or prosecution of a deputy for
misconduct);

prevents district attorney representatives from interviewing officers involved in shooting
until LAPD internal investigations are complete).
277 Cf. Wright, supra note 36, at 437 (noting that prosecutors are likely to be overinclu-
sive when identifying witnesses who may later be prosecuted and thus should not receive

278 Although the law enforcement effort in general suffers from less thorough internal
investigations of police officers, because it may both enable officers to escape deserved
discipline and diminish the certainty and deterrent effect of administrative sanctions, those
costs are likely too remote to shape prosecutors'  decisions.
279 Bloch proposes that "[p]rosecuting authorities..,  would have a limited time period
in which to submit an objection to the taking of the statement."  Bloch, supra note 11,  at
684.  Such a time limit would increase the incentive to over-veto.

assemble more facts before making their determination, it may be too
late for internal affairs to obtain a useful statement.
Excessive exercise of vetoes could substantially undermine efforts
to address police misconduct by depriving investigators of critical evi-
dence. 80  For all the shortcomings of administrative review and disci-
pline of police misconduct,' 1 it remains the most widely used method
of addressing police  misconduct.  In addition, if police departments
routinely act on complaints  without statements  from the suspect of-
28o See, e.g., Newton, supra note 90 (reporting LAPD police chief's contention that
compelled statements "are essential to the department as it conducts its internal review of
shootings and decides whether administrative action is warranted"); cf. Wright, supra note
36, at 436 (arguing that reluctance to use compulsion orders will mean -less-than-complete
congressional investigations").
Professor Bloch's contention that overinclusive use of vetoes would leave police disci-
plinary boards in no worse a position than trial juries resolving guilt or innocence without
the benefit of a defendant's statement or testimony, see supra note 272, is not reassuring.
First, in many cases juries do have a defendant's pretrial statements to police, even if the
defendant chooses to remain silent at trial. Second, because of the importance of criminal
prosecutions, society devotes considerable resources to the investigation of crime. A thor-
ough investigation may partially compensate for evidence unavailable due to a defendant's
silence before and during trial.  Because police departments may, and perhaps should,
devote fewer resources  to administrative  investigations  than to criminal  investigations,
there is more reason to be troubled by the loss of evidence resulting from an inability to
take statements from suspect police officers.  Finally, although juries routinely decide cases
without a defendant's statements and testimony, we accept that state of affairs because the
Constitution compels it. If it were a policy choice, perhaps we would compel defendants to
submit to orderly pretrial interrogation or require that they testify at trial.  Indeed, a num-
ber of scholars have argued that operation of the privilege in this context is indefensible.
See, e.g., David Dolinko, Is There a Rationale for the Privilege Against Self-Incrimina-
tion?, 33 UCLA L. Rev. 1063, 1064 (1986) (suggesting that efforts to justify privilege -as
more than a historical relic are uniformly unsatisfactory"); Donald A. Dripps, Supreme
Court Review-Foreword:  Against Police Interrogation-and the Privilege Against Self
Incrimination, 78 J. Crim. L. & Criminology 699,723 (19S8)  (identifying privilege as "chief
legal obstacle to achieving..,  an accomodation" that permits confessions without -need-
less brutality" by pretrial judicial interrogation); Friendly, supra note 164, at 713-15 (en-
dorsing proposal for pretrial judicial interrogation of criminal defendants).
281  Those shortcomings are considerable.  See, e.g., Shielded From Justice, supra note 6,
at 5 ("In each city we examined, internal affairs units too often conducted substandard
investigations, sustained few allegations of excessive force, and failed to identify and pun-
ish officers against whom repeated complaints had been filed."). The Mollen Commission
Report paints a particularly troubling portrait of the New York City Police Department
Internal Affairs Division (LAD):
We found that LAD  had virtually abandoned  its primary functions over the
past years...  [a]nd ...  no one in the Department seemed to care....  IAD
investigators...  told us that the work ethic in LAD was to close cases with as

nuts and do crossword puzzles"....

note 72, at 153 ("[l]n cases involving allegations of excessive force, the System is unfairly
skewed against the complainant."); Hoffman, supra note 6, at 1478-82 (discussing abuses

ficers,  the  disciplinary  system  may  lose  legitimacy  in  the  eyes  of
282
officers.
Even if the notice-and-veto solution worked, and prosecutors ex-
ercised vetoes in only those cases in which  criminal prosecution  ap-
peared likely, the results would be undesirable.  In cases in which the
prosecutor exercised the veto, the suspect police officer would escape
administrative questioning without cost.  In cases in which the prose-
cutor did not exercise a veto, the suspect officer would enjoy the bene-
fits of immunity if evidence discovered later resulted in a prosecution
that was  not foreseeable  when  the  prosecutor  permitted  the  com-
pelled statement.  If there are constitutional  alternatives,  we should
not settle for these options.
2.  Controlling Dissemination of Compelled Statements
The  taking  of  a  compelled  statement  alone  does  not  create
Garrity immunity problems.  The problems  arise when investigators
disseminate  the  compelled  statement.  If prosecutors,  investigators,
and witnesses are never exposed to a compelled statement, it cannot
taint them.283  Thus, an alternative approach would be to restrict dis-
semination of compelled statements.  For example, internal affairs in-
vestigators could be required to seal compelled statements and refrain
from using them during investigations.
The cost of such an approach is difficult to gauge.  There may be
legitimate  reasons  for  police  investigators  to expose  witnesses  and
complainants  to the substance of a compelled statement to verify or
contradict the suspect officer's version of events.284  Exposure may be
direct,  by having  witnesses  read the statement,  or indirect,  such as
when an internal affairs investigator asks questions formulated  from
the suspect  officer's compelled  statement  that impart otherwise  un-
available information.
If a blanket prohibition on dissemination would impair internal
investigations too greatly, a notice-and-veto procedure governing dis-
semination decisions, similar to the one that Professor Bloch proposes
for the decision to take a compelled statement, might be more feasi-
ble.  Such a procedure would give investigators  unfettered discretion
to take  compelled  statements  but would  require  prosecutorial  ap-
282 See Perez & Muir, supra note 13, at 217 (describing police view of Berkeley Police
Review Commission as "kangaroo court" because it conducts investigations without inter-
view of suspect police officer).

proval to disseminate them, including use in witness interviews.  Al-
though a veto might impair an administrative investigation somewhat,
the suspect officer's statement still would  be available to adjudicate
the misconduct allegation.
This approach has shortcomings  as well.  First, it would be diffi-
cult to enforce.  Particularly challenging would be any effort to restrict
use of compelled statements to frame questions for witnesses.  Even
conscientious investigators  might be unable to avoid communicating
something about the contents of a compelled statement inadvertently
during an interview.28  Second, this approach might run afoul of laws
and regulations requiring police departments to give officers involved
in an investigated incident copies of compelled statements from that
investigation.286 Similarly, statutory and constitutional discovery obli-
gations in multidefendant  cases,  requiring  that the prosecution  dis-
close  all  the  defendant  officers'  compelled  statements,2s7  would
undermine  efforts to limit dissemination.  Once a police  officer has
obtained a fellow officer's compelled  statement, he may have legiti-
mate reasons to show it to potential witnesses, thereby tainting them.
A police officer could challenge testimony from witnesses exposed to
285 An approach by which only internal affairs investigators who were not familiar with
a suspect police officer's compelled statements conducted all follow-up investigation also
would be problematic.  One of the principal functions of follow-up investigation is to test
the veracity of the suspect officer's version of events. It would be difficult, if not impossi-
ble, for an investigator who was unfamiliar with the officer's statement to perform that
function.
286 See, e.g., Cal. Gov't Code § 3303(g) (West 1995)  (requiring that officers who are
interrogated during investigation have access to tape recordings and stenographers'  notes
of their interrogation, as well as "any reports or complaints made by investigators or other
persons, except those which are deemed...  confidential").
287  Statutory discovery rules may require disclosure of codefendants'  compelled state-
ments. See, e.g., N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law § 240.20 (McKinney 1989) (requiring disclosure of
statements of jointly tried codefendants).  But see Fed. R. Crim. P. 16(a) (requiring disclo-
sure of certain documents, but not codefendant statements). Even absent a statutory man-
date, it may be prudent for a prosecutor to disclose codefendants' compelled statements to
a defendant police officer.  Because sound practice dictates that the trial prosecutor not
read or otherwise be exposed to the contents of the compelled statement, see supra notes
63-67 and accompanying text, she will not know if the compelled statements contain excul-
patory information that must be disclosed under the rule of Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83
(1963), and its progeny.  Prosecutors in the office not assigned to the case may be able to
read the statement without fear of tainting the prosecution, but their lack of familiarity
with the case may render them unable to identify exculpatory evidence in the statements.
Because even an inadvertent failure to disclose exculpatory evidence violates Brady, see
Kyles v. Whitley, 514 U.S. 419,437-38 (1995) (holding that prosecutor has duty to discover
and produce favorable and material evidence), the best course of action might be to dis-
close the codefendants' compelled statements in all cases.

his compelled statement through actions of a fellow officer, even if the
prosecutor was not responsible for the exposure.288
3.  Encouraging Cooperation Without "Compulsion"
An alternative approach would be to permit police departments
to use only sanctions less severe than job termination to encourage
cooperation with internal affairs investigators.  For example, if a po-
lice officer suspected of misconduct refused to answer questions, a de-
partment could  be permitted  to do no more than  draw an  adverse
inference from his silence when  adjudicating  the misconduct  allega-
tion.289  Two Supreme  Court  decisions,  Baxter v.  Palmigiano290  and
Ohio Adult Parole Authority v.  Woodard,29t  suggest that statements
made under those circumstances  are admissible in criminal cases.29g
Palmigiano was an inmate in a state penitentiary.  The institution
accused  him of conduct  that both violated prison disciplinary  rules
and exposed  him  to possible  criminal  prosecution.293  When  he ap-
peared before the disciplinary board, prison authorities told him that
he  had  a right  to  remain  silent  but that  his silence  could  be  held
against him.294  He remained silent.  Although silence alone was insuf-
ficient to justify disciplinary  measures,  the prison board  gave  it the
"evidentiary  value  [that] was warranted by the facts surrounding his
288 See supra note 102 (noting that tainted witness testimony may be inadmissible with-
out regard to whether prosecution was responsible for exposure).
289 Although  the Court has prohibited juries from  drawing adverse  inferences  from
criminal defendants'  failure to testify at trial, see Carter v. Kentucky, 450 U.S. 288, 305
(1981)  (holding defendant entitled to instruction prohibiting adverse inference from si-
lence); Griffin v. California, 380 U.S. 609, 615 (1965)  (prohibiting prosecutorial comment
on defendant's silence), it "has consistently recognized that in proper circumstances silence
in the face of accusation is a relevant fact not barred from evidence by the Due Process
Clause,"  Baxter v. Palmigiano,  425  U.S. 308, 319  (1976)  (citations  omitted);  see also
Mitchell v. United States, 526 U.S. 314, 332 (1999) (Scalia, J., dissenting) ("If I ask my son
whether he saw a movie I had forbidden him to watch, and he remains silent, the import of
his silence is clear.").

291  523 U.S. 272 (1998).
292 Another decision, Minnesota v. Murphy, 465 U.S. 420 (1984), just misses the mark.
Murphy was a probationer subject to a probation condition that he be truthful with his
probation officer.  In response to questions from the probation officer, Murphy admitted
involvement in a rape and murder unrelated to the crime for which lie was on probation.
The Court considered whether Murphy's statement fell within Garrity, which would have
required that "the probationer's [statement] ...b e deemed compelled and inadmissible in
a criminal prosecution."  Id. at 435-36.  Because the "precise contours of Murphy's obliga-
tion to respond to questions" were not clear, the Court declined to assume that he would
have been penalized for refusing to answer.  Id. at 437-38.

prison operations, which might have resulted in a riot.  Id.

case.''295  After assessing the evidence  against Palmigiano, including
his silence, the board imposed thirty days of punitive segregation and
altered his prison classification status.  He sued, contending that use of
his silence violated his constitutional rights.296
The Baxter Court recognized that Garrity and the other "penalty
cases"  established  the  applicable  legal  framework.297  It  also  con-
firmed that the Fifth Amendment requires that "if inmates are com-
pelled in those proceedings to furnish testimonial evidence that might
incriminate them in later criminal proceedings, they must be offered
'whatever immunity is required to supplant the privilege' and may not
be required to 'waive  such immunity."298  But, although  there had
been no offer or guarantee of immunity, the Court concluded that the
prison properly could  draw  an adverse  inference from Palmigiano's
silence.299
Because Palmigiano had remained silent, the Court had no rea-
son to address directly the issue of concern here:  whether, had  he
chosen to answer questions rather than suffer the consequences of re-
maining silent, a prosecutor would have been able to use his statement
in a criminal prosecution.300  But there is good reason to believe that
the Court would have permitted such use.
If the Court had concluded the opposite-that threatened eviden-
tiary  use  of  silence  gives  rise  to  de  facto  immunity,  as  had  the
threatened job termination in Garrity-therew  ould have been no rea-
son to distinguish  Garrity and the other penalty  cases.  The Baxter
Court could have resolved Palimigiano's claim simply by applying the
principle from the penalty cases that a state validly can threaten sanc-

held [sic], in dictum, however, that use immunity would be required should criminal pro-
ceedings later be instituted against the inmate ....  ."). Actually, the Baxter Court stated
that "if inmates are compelled in [prison disciplinary proceedings] to furnish testimonial
evidence that might incriminate them in later criminal proceedings, they must be offered
'whatever immunity is required to supplant the privilege.'"  Barter, 425 U.S. at 316 (cita-
tions omitted). But, as that passage makes clear, immunity is required only if inmates are
"compelled."  As noted below, see infra notes 301-16 and accompanying  text, Baxter is
better read to hold that the threatened evidentiary use of silence was not sufficient "com-
pulsion" to trigger the privilege.  Thus, no immunity was required.
The Baxter majority did note that "[n]o  criminal proceedings are or were pending
against Palmigiano," Baxter, 425 U.S. at 317, but, as Justice Brennan pointed out in dissent,
the applicability of the privilege is not contingent on whether criminal charges have been
filed, id.a t 327-28 (Brennan, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).

tions for refusal  to answer  questions  pertinent  to an administrative
inquiry because any resulting statements are not admissible in crimi-
nal cases.301  Instead, it distinguished those decisions.  They involved
"threats  of  serious  economic  reprisal,''302  while  the  warning  to
Palmigiano was no more than "advice"  and "merely a realistic reflec-
tion of the evidentiary significance  of the choice to remain silent."303
In addition, in the penalty cases,  "failure to respond to interrogation
was treated as a final admission of guilt,"304 whereas in Baxter, it was
"undisputed that an inmate's silence in and of itself is insufficient to
support  an  adverse  decision  by  the  Disciplinary  Board. '305  The
Court's  approach  suggests  that  it  permitted  the  adverse  inference
from Palmigiano's silence not because any resulting statements would
be immunized,  but because the threat to draw the inference,  unlike
the threat in Garrity, was not sufficient "compulsion"  to trigger the
Fifth Amendment privilege.306
This interpretation  is supported  by the  Court's conclusion  that
the threatened use of Palmigiano's silence as evidence in the discipli-
nary proceeding "does not smack of an invalid attempt by the State to
compel testimony without granting immunity or to penalize the exer-
cise  of the privilege. '307  Although he  disagreed  with the outcome,
Justice  Brennan  read  the majority  opinion in  Baxter precisely that

way.

more equitable for the non-invoking party," rather than "either to punish the claimant or
to compel testimony, or both").
306 See Lefkowitz v. Cunningham, 431 U.S. 801, 808 n.5 (1977)  (interpreting Baxter to
hold that evidentiary use of silence in civil proceeding was insufficient to trigger protec-
tions of privilege).  The Baxter Court's repeated references to Garrity also are significant.
Baxter, 425 U.S. at 316-18.  As noted earlier, among the Court's Fifth Amendment cases,
Garrity alone addressed the later use in a criminal case of statements given by a municipal
employee.  See supra notes 16-19 and accompanying text.  By referring to and distinguish-
ing Garrity rather than only the later cases discussing the constitutionality of the penalty
for silence, the Court may have been indicating its view that any statements would have
been freely admissible in a criminal case.

The Court's more recent decision in Ohio Adult ParoleA  uthority
v. Woodard309 supports this view of Bater. At issue there was the
constitutionality of a portion of Ohio's clemency process by which  a
death row  inmate seeking clemency  had  the option of interviewing
with one or more parole board members, who in turn would make
recommendations to the governor.310  Inmate Woodard claimed that
this procedure  violated  his Fifth Amendment  privilege  because his
statements at the interview could incriminate him in other crimes 311
Although the Court assumed that the parole board "[would]  draw ad-
verse inferences from [an  inmate's] refusal to answer questions, '312
relying on Baxter, the Court determined that the threat of an adverse
inference  from  silence  did  not  constitute  compulsion  under  the
privilege.3'3
Lower courts  also have read Baxter to hold that sanctions  less
severe than job loss do not constitute "compulsion"  sufficient to trig-
ger the privilege314 and have applied it to disciplinary proceedings in-
brought against him. He was also told that anything he said in the disciplinary
hearing could be used against him in a criminal proceeding. Thus, the possibil-
ity of self-incrimination was just as real and the threat of a penalty just as
coercive.  Moreover, the Fifth Amendment does not distinguish among types
or degrees of compulsion.  It prohibits "inducement  of any sort."  Brain v.
United States, 168 U.S. 532, 548 (1897)....  Palmigiano was forced to choose
between self-incrimination and punitive segregation or some similar penalty.
Since the Court does not overrule the Garrity-Lejkowitz group of decisions,
those precedents compel the conclusion that this constituted impermissible
compulsion.

volving police  and  other  municipal  employees.315  Like  Ohio Adult
Parole Authority, the lower courts' reading suggests that if a threat of
evidentiary use of silence  in a disciplinary  proceeding  persuades an
officer  suspected  of misconduct  to answer  questions,  the  privilege
does  not  bar  use  of  the  resulting  statements  in  a  criminal
316
prosecution.
If this interpretation of Baxter is correct, it offers an attractive
solution to Garrity immunity problems.  State statutes, municipal ordi-
nances, and  departmental policies  could be  rewritten  to reduce  the
sanction for police officers' refusal to answer internal affairs investiga-
tors'  questions.  If officers  suspected of misconduct  chose to remain
silent, that silence would be admissible, not conclusive, in departmen-
tal disciplinary hearings to support an adverse inference.317  Internal
affairs investigators would be permitted to explain that consequence
to suspect police officers.  If officers answered questions to avoid evi-
dentiary use of their silence, prosecutors would be free to introduce
the statements in criminal prosecutions and would have no burden of
disproving any use of the statements.
This approach accommodates the competing concerns of adminis-
trative investigators, prosecutors, and suspect officers.  In most cases,
suspect officers likely will give statements to internal affairs investiga-
tors rather than permit use of their silence  in a disciplinary proceed-
ing. Many misconduct accusations involve one-on-one situations, with
no evidence other than a complainant's  claim and the police officer's

ing that civil servant who chooses to testify in administrative hearing regarding  alleged
misconduct that is also subject of pending criminal charges waives immunity even if deci-
sion to remain silent would "virtually guarantee the loss of his job"); Ryan, 580 F.2d at 993

proceeding"); United States v. Najarian, 915 F. Supp. 1460, 1478-83 & n.25 (D. Minn. 1996)
(holding threat of loss of indemnification for legal fees not sufficient compulsion to require

ment privilege).

response.318  In such cases, as well as similar situations in which there
is scant corroborating evidence, the threat of criminal prosecution is
minimal.  In contrast, the impact of the officer's silence could prove
significant, leaving the disciplinary  board with only a complainant's
uncontested allegation of misconduct and an adverse inference from
the silence.  This will provide police officers with a powerful incentive
to make a statement.  Internal affairs investigators likely will obtain
statements  helpful  to their  investigation  without  triggering  Garrity
319
immunity.
The cases in which police officers are least likely to make state-
ments are those where there is considerable incriminating  evidence,
leading suspect officers to believe that there is a realistic possibility of
criminal prosecution.  Although silence in such cases will deprive in-
ternal affairs investigators  of evidence, other proof will compensate
for that loss. If officers do choose to make statements in such cases, it
will not impair any criminal investigation or prosecution.
This approach should satisfy police officers as well as prosecutors
and internal affairs investigators.  It reduces the sanction for officers'
refusal to answer questions from internal affairs investigators, making
their jobs more secure.  And, because police are not entitled to Gar-
rity immunity for statements  that are not the product of "compul-
sion," they have no legitimate complaint if statements that they make
to internal affairs investigators in order to avoid the adverse inference
from silence are later used in criminal cases.
CONCLUSION
The  substantial  authority  that  society  vests  in  police  officers
makes their violations of the criminal law especially menacing.  Gar-
rity immunity creates  conflicts between  administrative  and criminal
investigations  and  erects  unnecessary  impediments  to the  effective
prosecution of police criminality.  It can operate as a trap for investi-
318 See Cheli, supra note 8, at 253 ("In many cases the only witnesses will be the victim
and the police ....  ."); Kerstetter, supra note 98, at 234 (noting that there are no indepen-
dent witnesses in most cases of police misconduct); Perez & Muir, supra note 13, at 223
("[T]he system cannot develop evidence  independent of the statements of officers and
citizens ...".).
319 Even if a person's sole means of defending himself in an administrative proceeding is
to testify, and thus possibly provide self-incriminating information, such testimony is not
immunized even if a failure to testify almost certainly would guarantee an adverse adminis-
trative determination.  See Diebold, 611 F.2d at 698-99 (holding that it was -constitution-
ally permissible"  to force employee to choose between remaining silent, which  would
"virtually guarantee  the loss of his job," and waiving Fifth Amendment  privilege); cf.
United States v. White, 589 F.2d 1283, 1286 (5th Cir. 1979) (holding that defendant's in-
criminating testimony given in civil trial was admissible in related criminal proceeding).

gators and prosecutors who fail either to take steps to minimize expo-
sure to compelled statements  or to prepare to disprove taint.  It can
serve as a tool for unscrupulous internal affairs investigators who seek
to undermine criminal prosecutions by disseminating compelled state-
ments  and  treacherous  police  witnesses  who  allege  that  they  are
tainted in order to avoid giving prosecution testimony.  Even if alert
to those dangers, prosecutors can only minimize, not eliminate, them,
and must expend significant resources to do so.
Although there may be reason for the Supreme Court's determi-
nation  that the Fifth Amendment  privilege  protects police  officers'
compelled statements, courts need not employ a robust exclusionary
rule  that  forces  prosecutors  to  demonstrate  that  all  evidence,
prosecutorial  decisionmaking,  and witness testimony is wholly unaf-
fected by such statements.  Absent judicial limitations on the scope of
Garrity, legislatures  and police  departments  can and should  modify
policies  and  practices  surrounding  the acquisition  and use  of com-
pelled statements in internal affairs investigations.  Instead of compel-
ling  statements  by threatening  job  loss,  statutes  and  departmental
policies should encourage cooperation by notifying suspect police of-
ficers that a refusal to answer questions will have evidentiary signifi-
cance in administrative adjudicatory proceedings.  This should permit
prosecutors  to make full  use of any  resulting statements.  Alterna-
tively, legislatures and police departments can and should impose con-
straints on dissemination of compelled statements.
