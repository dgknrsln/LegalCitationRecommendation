obligations.1  “Policy laundering,” as the practice has been called, 
has most recently come to the fore in the field of intellectual 
property, where the interaction between international trade law and 
intellectual property standards has come under increasing scrutiny.2  
Multinational  corporations  in  industries  reliant  on  robust 
intellectual  property  protection  have  driven  a  process  of 
expansionism  through  the  inclusion  of  intellectual  property 
 
provisions in trade agreements.3 The consequences of this corporate 
involvement  in  trade  negotiations  include  the  imposition  of 
substantive intellectual property provisions that favor corporate 
 
interests,4 and thedisturbance of the traditional balance between the 
interests  of  rights  holders  and  the  public  interest  in  access  to 
knowledge.5 
As a result, opposition to intellectual property provisions in 
international trade agreements is based as much on procedure as on 
substance.6  Opponents of the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement 
(“ACTA”) have focused not only on its substantive content, which 
disregards the need for  flexibility and  exceptions  to  intellectual 
 
property  rights,7 but  also  on  the  process  by  which  these 
  
substantive rules were negotiated.8 Similar complaints have dogged 
the  more  recent  Trans-Pacific  Partnership  (“TPP”)  trade

rise to allegations of policy laundering.12 
Yet  the  current  literature  on  policy  laundering  paints  an 
incomplete  picture.  Traditional accounts  of  policy  laundering 
presuppose the existence of a monolithic executive branch, whose 
primary opponents are the legislative branch and civil society.13  
Such an account is insufficient to explain instances in which various 
branches of the executive appear to be at odds with each other. 
I  argue  that  there  exists  a  distinct  sub-species  of  policy 
laundering, referred to here as “intra-executive policy laundering.”  
International regulatory coordination is not only a vehicle through 
which the executive as a whole seeks to advance its agenda vis-a-
vis other branches of government—it is also a means through which 
one executive agency can advance its own substantive agenda, and 
expand  its  own  domestic  regulatory  authority  vis-a-vis  other 
executive agencies.  Consequently, executive agencies will compete 
to coordinate with counterpart agencies in other states, exacerbating 
the incidence of policy laundering by the executive as a whole.  
Intra-executive policy laundering also creates greater difficulties 
for  the  legislature  and  civil  society  in detecting and opposing 
policy laundering, as they face a multitude of opponents rather than 
a  monolithic  executive.    Despite  potential  benefits  in  breaking 
regulatory deadlock and increasing international coordination, this 
article argues that the lack of transparency and accountability that 
accompanies intra-executive policy laundering is more pernicious 
than  that  associated  with  policy  laundering  by  a  monolithic 
executive.    Ultimately,  however,  the  language  of  “policy 
laundering” is misplaced, insofar as it emphasizes a substantive 
policy pursued by an executive entity, rather than the expansion of 
that entity’s sphere of autonomy. 
Part I reviews the existing literature on policy laundering, as 
well as previous literature referring to the phenomenon as the “new 
raison d’état” and “collusive delegation.”  It contends that the 
traditional account of “policy laundering” refers to a phenomenon 
in which the executive has two main objectives: to advance a

particular  substantive  agenda  and  to  increase  its  net  autonomy 
(namely the sum of its external autonomy in the international arena 
and its internal autonomy vis-a-vis the legislature and civil society).  
Part II provides a brief theoretical account of intra-executive policy 
laundering.  Part III discusses two examples of policy laundering 
which cannot be adequately explained by traditional accounts of 
policy laundering, as well as one counter-example, and explains 
them with reference to the idea of intra-executive policy laundering.  
Part IV offers some tentative conclusions. 
I. The Traditional Account of Policy Laundering 
The earliest references to “policy laundering” as a phrase date 
  
back to 2003.14 Yet the process now called “policy laundering” has 
been addressed in much earlier academic literature.15 
However, the phrase “policy laundering” brings one particular 
aspect to the fore: the attempt to implement substantive policies that 
would not survive domestic political scrutiny through international 
fora.  The phrase itself conjures up parallels with money laundering: 
If “money laundering” describes the cycling of illegitimate funds 
through  legal  structures  in  order  to  enter  them  into  legitimate 
circulation, policy laundering similarly involves recycling policies 
that lack political legitimacy through outside intuitions in order to 
get them into circulation despite their lack of acceptance.16 This 
section will first provide examples of policy laundering, both in 
copyright and in other fields.  It will then outline the theoretical 
discussion of policy laundering, with reference to the literature on 
the “new raison d’état” and “collusive delegation.”

in international fora.17  However, the defining feature of policy

  17 Gus Hosein, Revisiting Policy Laundering and Modern International Policy 
Dynamics, in RESEARCH HANDBOOK ON GOVERNANCE OF THE INTERNET 260, 265 (Ian 
Brown ed., 2013).  I acknowledge that executives in presidential and semi-presidential 
systems have democratic legitimacy of their own; however, addressing their competing 254  N.C. J. INT'L L.  [Vol. XLI 
laundering is that the laundering executive entity promotes a policy 
abroad that does not (or does not yet) have domestic consensus or 
   
approval.18 The  laundering  entity  then  seeks  to  convince  the 
domestic legislature to approve the policy, in order to comply with 
  
“international obligations.”19 The domestic legislation advocated 
by the laundering entity may—or may not—be required by the 
international instruments in question.20 
The anti-circumvention provisions of the Digital Millennium 
Copyright Act (“DMCA”) in the United States are a notable early 
instance  of  policy  laundering  in  the  copyright  realm.    Anti-
circumvention  refers  to  legal  restrictions  on  the  ability  to 
circumvent  digital  rights  management  (“DRM”)  technologies.  
DRM systems, such as the Content Scrambling System (“CSS”) 
used for DVDs, typically seek to prevent the unauthorized copying 
 
of digital content.21  In principle, such systems could impose other 
limits on a user’s ability to use digital content, such as limits on how 
  
long a user can pause a video.22 However, the nature of DRM—
which requires the encryption of content to prevent users from 
accessing it through “unauthorized means,” while simultaneously 
providing  users  with  limited  access—renders  it  inherently 
   
vulnerable  to  circumvention.23 Anti-circumvention  provisions 
impose legal restrictions on the ability to make, sell, or use methods 
 
of DRM circumvention.24
Shortly after President Clinton assumed office, the White House 
established an “Information Infrastructure Task Force” to formulate 
the administration’s Internet policy.25  The task force included a 
Working  Group  on  Intellectual  Property,  chaired  by  Patent 
Commissioner Bruce Lehman.26  Prior to his appointment as Patent

Commissioner, Lehman represented the computer software industry 
on copyright issues; the Lehman Working Group had extensive 
communications with private-sector copyright lobbyists.27  As a 
result, the Working Group sought to secure extensive control over 
digital content for rights holders,28 including anti-circumvention 
provisions.29  Faced with intense resistance in Congress,30 Lehman 
lobbied  the  Office  of  the  United  States  Trade  Representative 
(“USTR”)  to  propose  anti-circumvention  at  the  U.N.  World 
Intellectual Property Organization (“WIPO”).31  Lehman’s lobbying 
efforts directly contributed to the inclusion of anti-circumvention 
provisions in the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996 (“WCT”), which 
formed  the  basis  for  the  corresponding  DMCA  provisions.32  
Speaking about the DMCA in March, 2013, Lehman was accused 
of using the WIPO treaty process to avoid Congressional opposition 
to DRM, to which he responded, “I would say that they’re right.”33 
As  alluded  to  in  the  introduction,  ACTA  is  a  more  recent 
example of policy laundering at work.  Negotiated in tight secrecy, 
the first formal draft of ACTA was published on April 21, 2010 and 
the final draft in December 2010.34  Even before the formal drafts 
were released, commentators began to express concerns regarding 
leaked negotiation texts.35  The final text included provisions that 
expanded the scope of criminal copyright violations,36 dictated more 
stringent border measures,37 and encouraged parties to implement

Many of ACTA’s substantive provisions have been rejected by 
domestic political processes in the United States and elsewhere.40  
The secretive nature of the process by which ACTA was negotiated, 
coupled with its IP-maximalist substantive provisions, have given 
rise to allegations of policy laundering.41 
The TPP is a still more recent example of policy laundering.  
Successive texts of the TPP’s intellectual property chapter revealed 
provisions that overwhelmingly favor the interests of rights-holders, 
at the expense of users, consumers, and countervailing public policy 
interests.42  Commentators such as Canadian professor Michael 
Geist and the Electronic Frontier Foundation, an NGO, have linked 
the substantive imbalance of these provisions with the lack of 
transparency surrounding TPP negotiations.43  Flynn and others,

commenting on an early U.S. proposal, gave the blunt assessment 
that it was “an incredibly unbalanced proposal emanating from an 
extraordinarily imbalanced process.”44 
Policy laundering in the copyright sphere has resulted in (or has 
threatened)  provisions  that  tilt  the  copyright  balance  in  rights-
holders’ favor, at the expense of the general public.  The DMCA’s 
anti-circumvention provisions have been used to stifle freedom of 
expression and academic research.45  In addition, the ambit of anti-
circumvention (which covers circumvention done to enable what 
would otherwise constitute fair use under U.S. copyright law) has 
given rights-holders the ability unilaterally to circumscribe fair use 
through DRM.46  ACTA and TPP intellectual property provisions 
are  similarly  unbalanced  in  favoring  the  interests  of  rights-
holders—without  corresponding  increases  in  exceptions  and 
limitations  for  the  public  good.    By  presenting  oppressive 
substantive copyright provisions as a fait accompli required to 
comply with international obligations, policy launderers circumvent 
domestic channels for policy-setting and legislative debate and 
forestall domestic initiatives for copyright reform.47 
B.  Policy Laundering in Other Fields 
Instances of policy laundering also occur in a variety of other 
fields.  Mathias Koenig-Archibugi has argued that Germany and 
Italy have extensively used the (then) European Community (“EC”) 
as  a  vehicle  for  laundering  foreign  and  security  policy.48  
Allegations of policy laundering are also common in the field of 
national  security;  the  ACLU’s  Policy  Laundering  Project,  for 
example,  was  formed  to  monitor  and  influence  fields  of

C.  The Theory Behind Traditional Accounts of Policy 
Laundering 
At  first  glance,  policy  laundering  seems  to  have  received 
academic  attention  only  recently;  the  earliest  references  to  the 
 
phrase  date  back  to  2003.50  Yet  discussion  of  the  underlying 
phenomenon has a much lengthier history.  As early as 1971, Karl 
Kaiser warned that the internationalization of formerly domestic 
issues was “inherently incompatible with the traditional framework 
 
of  democratic  control.”51  Kaiser  argued  that  the  traditional 
distinction in Western democratic theory between foreign policy—
which  was  subject  only  to  limited  democratic  control—and 
domestic politics would become increasingly untenable with the 
 
convergence  between  the  two  areas.52  As  a  result,  malicious 
executive branches could partially escape responsibility to their 
respective legislatures by “pointing to the involvement of other 
governments  and  to  their  shared  responsibility  for  common 
measures,”53 or prevent legislative or public input into multinational 
 
decision-making before presenting them with a fait accompli.54 
Even if the executive intended to submit to democratic control, 
Kaiser  added,  the  system  of  multinational  interactions  is  too 
complex for executive actors to understand, never mind master.55  
Although Kaiser assumed that executives might engage in policy 
laundering with benign intentions,56 later literature has imputed

more self-serving motives.57  In a 1994 working paper, Andrew 
Moravcsik  made  three  key  arguments.58    First,  international 
negotiations and institutions change the “domestic institutional[,] 
informational[,] and ideological context in which domestic policy is 
 
made.”59  In  particular,  redefining  “domestic  policy”  issues  as 
“foreign policy” enabled control of which domestic actors could 
initiate policy, altered the constitutional and statutory environment 
in which policy decisions were adopted and implemented, created 
(or  eliminated)  informational  asymmetries,  and  changed  the 
 
available justifications for policies.60  Second, Moravcsik argued 
that  such  re-allocation  generally  favors  actors  who  participate 
directly  and  most  frequently  in  international  negotiations  and 
  
institutions—typically executive branches.61 Third, the shift in 
domestic  power  toward  such  actors  facilitates  international 
  
cooperation by encouraging the formation of “executive cartels.”62
Moravcsik  then  applied  his  framework  to  the  (then)  European 
Community  and  concluded  that  the  “democratic  deficit”  it 
engendered was “an integral part of the EC’s institutional design,” 
  
in  that  it  conferred  greater  domestic  influence  on  executives.63
Moravcsik  suggested  that  national  executives  “seek  to  create 
institutions  that  permit  them  to  control  international  agendas, 
circumvent domestic ratification, reach decisions in secret, and 
exploit strong, ambiguous ‘grand strategic’ ideologies,” as well as 
to  insulate  new  policies  from national interest groups or future 
  
governments of a different party.64 However, Moravcsik did not 
suggest  that  the  primary  motivation  of  national  executives  in 
entering into international institutions is to maximize their internal 
autonomy.65 
Unlike Moravcsik, Klaus Dieter Wolf contended that autonomy

maximization  was  indeed  the  primary  objective  of  national 
executives.66  In a 1999 article, he referred to a “new raison d’état” 
 
as a threat to democratic governance.67  Wolf argued that state 
executives voluntarily entered into mutually binding arrangements 
to manipulate the domestic context and constrain the capacity of 
civil society to shape events by presenting them with a fait accompli 
and the simple binary choice to accept or reject it.68 
Wolf’s  argument  begins  from  two  premises:  (1)  that 
governments have their own strategic interest in maximizing their 
autonomy; and (2) that increasing societal demands for participation 
and the growing prominence of transnational actors restrict that 
  
autonomy.69 Wolf argues that governments value the maintenance 
(or  increase)  of  their  autonomy  over  the  pursuit  of  material 
preferences––in other words, that they will accept outcomes that 
detract from the “common good” provided that such outcomes 
 
maximize their autonomy.70  Wolf then sets out various options 
available to governments for safeguarding internal autonomy before 
describing  the  possibility  of  using  voluntary  intergovernmental 
arrangements.71  In Wolf’s account, “[a]s soon as regulations have 
a  bearing  on  the  internal  political  process,  mutual  self-
  
commitment  has  no  longer  merely  restrictive  implications.”72
Through the use of non-transparent inter-governmental processes, 
state governments can manipulate the domestic context by tying 
their hands internationally.73 
Koenig-Archibugi drew on writing by Kaiser, Moravcsik, and 
 
Wolf in posing the “collusive delegation thesis.”74  The collusive 
delegation thesis consists of four points.75  First, governments value

their autonomy in the domestic and international spheres.76  Second, 
“participation in intergovernmental negotiations and institutions 
tends to increase governments’ domestic autonomy . . . .”77  Third, 
governments, when considering whether to engage in international 
institutions,  consider  the  effects  of  such  engagement  on  their 
domestic  autonomy  as  well  as  the  direct  benefits  of  such 
engagement.78  Fourth, when faced with a trade-off between internal 
and external autonomy, governments will choose the solution that 
improves their overall autonomy.79 
The analytical framework of collusive delegation sheds light on 
the motivations behind traditional accounts of policy laundering.80  
Although  the  language  of  policy  laundering  suggests  that  the 
objective  is  to  advance  a  particular  substantive  policy  despite 
domestic political opposition, the literature on collusive delegation 
suggests  that  this  is  not,  in  fact,  the  sole  (or  even  primary) 
objective.81  Although the executive may need to achieve a certain 
 
substantive  outcome  to  legitimize  its  continued  existence,82 a 
primary objective—if not the primary objective—of the executive-
as-strategic-actor  in  participating  in  international  fora  is  to 
maximize its net autonomy (i.e., the sum of its internal and external 
autonomy).83 
II. Intra-Executive Policy Laundering 
A.  The Theory Behind Intra-Executive Policy Laundering 
The  existing  literature  on  policy  laundering  and  collusive 
delegation assumes that the executive within a particular State is a 
monolithic  entity.84    For  instance,  Wolf  offers  “Machiavellian 
advice  to  a  government  seeking  to  maximize  its  autonomy  in 
contemporary multi-level governance.”85  The existing literature

  85 See Wolf, supra note 66, at 349 (emphasis added). 262  N.C. J. INT'L L.  [Vol. XLI 
also assumes that the targets of policy laundering are “legislatures, 
interest  groups  and  other  societal  actors.”86    Although  Kaiser 
suggested that the rise of transnational relations would increase the 
role  of  “technical”  ministries  (such  as  financial  regulators)  in 
foreign policy at the expense of foreign ministries, he did not 
explore the implications of that development.87  There has also been 
previous  discussion  of  competition  between  executive  agencies 
involving international coordination, but without explicitly linking 
the phenomenon to the broader literature on policy laundering.88 
This  article  links  the  academic  discussion  of  competition 
between executive agencies involving international coordination to 
the literature on policy laundering.  Unlike traditional accounts of 
policy  laundering,  which  assume  the  existence  of  monolithic 
governments  with  their  own  interests  and  preferences,  intra-
executive  policy  laundering  assumes  the  existence  of  diverse 
interest groups within the executive competing for the power to set 
executive policy.89  It suggests that the same forces that induce the 
executive as a whole to engage in policy laundering—namely the 
desire to maximize internal autonomy vis-a-vis legislatures and civil 
society, and external autonomy in the international arena—also 
apply to individual agencies within the executive vis-a-vis other 
executive  agencies  and  counterpart  regulators  in  other  States.90  
Although  intra-executive  policy  laundering  may  accompany  or 
exacerbate  policy  laundering  by  the  executive  as  a  whole,  the 
formation of the “executive position” for the purposes of the latter 
form of policy laundering may itself involve intra-executive policy 
laundering. 
Theories of regulation provide support for the idea of intra-
executive policy laundering.  Regardless of whether a particular 
theory assumes that regulators act in the public interest or in 
pursuit of their own self-interest, such regulators must nonetheless

seek autonomy in order to pursue their other objectives.91  As 
Colombatto and Macey argue, “[a]ll else equal, regulators would 
prefer not to cede or to share authority with their counterparts 
from  other  countries.”92    However,  faced  with  domestic 
policymaking constraints, executive entities have less to lose by 
entering into international agreements.93  On the contrary, such 
entities may have much to gain from entry into such agreements.  
One such benefit is the ability to cloak their desired policies in a 
veneer of international credibility.94  Another is to restrict the 
policy options available to other domestic regulators.95  Indeed, 
many of the premises in Koenig-Archibugi’s collusive delegation 
thesis  arguably  lend  themselves  to  intra-executive  policy 
laundering.96  If Koenig-Archibugi’s premises are reframed with 
reference  to  entities  within  an  executive,  rather  than  to  a 
monolithic executive, they might be restated in the following 
terms:  
1)  Entities  within  the  executive  value  their  capacity  to  act 
autonomously vis-a-vis competing executive entities (“internal 
autonomy”),  as  well  as  vis-a-vis  their  counterpart  executive 
entities in other States (“external autonomy”); 
2) Participation in international institutions tends to increase the 
internal  autonomy  of  executive  entities  and  increase  their 
influence within the executive as a whole; 
3) When  considering  whether  to  participate  in  international 
institutions, an executive actor will consider not only whether 
such international coordination will advance its particular policy 
preferences, but also its effects on the actor’s internal autonomy; 
and 
4) When  deciding  whether  to  participate  in  international 
institutions, an executive actor will select the option that most

advances its overall autonomy (i.e., the sum of its internal and

B.  A Hypothetical Example 
Hemel  provides  an  illustration  of  intra-executive  policy 
laundering (albeit without describing it as such): 
Imagine three regulators (1, 2, and 3) choose among three policy 
options (A, B, and C).  Regulator 1 prefers A to B and B to C.  
Regulator 2’s preference order is B, then C, then A.  Regulator 3’s 
preference order is C, then A, then B.  All regulators prefer A, B, 
and C to the status quo, but no single policy option generates a 2016  INTRA-EXECUTIVE POLICY LAUNDERING  265 
consensus (or even a majority).  The consequence is a voting 
“cycle”: “policy proposals can just go around and around with no 
end.”  The cycle will end only if one actor delimits the menu of 
options. 
International  institutions  can  enable  domestic  actors  to  assert 
control over the policy agenda by forcing a choice between two 
options.    For  example,  regulator  2  and  her  cross-border 
counterparts may sign an agreement adopting option B.  This 
forces  regulators  1  and  3  to  choose  between  ratification  and 
rejection of the accord (B versus the status quo).97 
In the above hypothetical, Regulator 2 has engaged in intra-
executive policy laundering in order to impose her chosen policy 
decision on Regulators 1 and 3. 
The interaction between intra-executive policy laundering and 
regular accounts of policy laundering can be illustrated by adding 
one further element to the hypothetical.  Posit that, in addition to 
Regulators 1, 2, and 3, there exists a domestic legislature that is 
opposed to all of options A, B, and C; in other words, it prefers to 
maintain the status quo.  Once Regulator 2 has laundered her chosen 
policy (option B)—thus compelling other executive agencies to fall 
into line—the executive as a whole might then engage in policy 
laundering (as traditionally understood) by forcing the legislature to 
accept option B. 
III. Intra-Executive Policy Laundering in Action 
A.  When Would Executive Entities Policy Launder? 
Koenig-Archibugi’s  four  premises  above  (as  adapted)  can 
provide  several  working  hypotheses  regarding  when  executive 
entities will engage in intra-executive policy laundering.98  When 
deciding whether to participate in international coordination, an 
executive entity will select the option that most advances its overall 
autonomy.99  This suggests that an executive entity with restricted 
internal autonomy but expansive external autonomy will be willing 
to sacrifice some of its external autonomy if the sacrifice will result 
in a more-than-equivalent increase in internal autonomy—in other 
words,  it  will  engage  in  intra-executive  policy  laundering.  
 
  97 Hemel, supra note 88, at 228–29 (internal citations omitted). 
  98 See KOENIG-ARCHIBUGI & ZÜRN, supra note 96. 
  99 See id. 266  N.C. J. INT'L L.  [Vol. XLI 
Conversely, an executive entity with expansive internal autonomy 
will have little incentive to engage in international coordination that 
will likely decrease its external autonomy. 
B.  Example 1—the Basel Accords 
The Basel I and II Accords are notable examples of intra-
executive policy laundering.  Basel I, which was signed in July 
1988, imposed common capital standards on banks.100  However, it 
did  not  impose  common  liquidity  requirements.101    Nor  did  it 
achieve its purported effect of “levelling the playing field” between 
American and Japanese banks.102  The background to both Basel I 
(and  the  subsequent  Basel  II)  show  how  the  Federal  Reserve 
engaged  in  intra-executive  policy  laundering  to  increase  its 
autonomy vis-a-vis other American financial regulators, while also 
advancing its own substantive policy agenda. 
Multiple  agencies  exercise  regulatory  authority  over 
commercial  banks  in  the  United  States.    The  Federal  Deposit 
Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”), the Treasury Department’s Office 
of  Comptroller  of  the  Currency  (“OCC”),  the  Office  of  Thrift 
Supervision  (“OTS”),  and  the  Federal  Reserve  each  assume 
responsibility  for  disparate  parts  of  the  United  States  banking 
system.103  The Federal Reserve’s domestic regulatory authority is 
comparatively weak, both in terms of the number of institutions 
supervised and in terms of the value of bank assets.104  However, it 
enjoys  far  stronger  international  connections  than  its  domestic 
regulatory rivals do.  Federal Reserve officials have engaged in 
regular  meetings  with  other  central  bankers  at  the  Bank  for 
International  Settlements’  Basel  headquarters  since  1974;105 
although the OCC and FDIC now each have one seat on the Basel 
Committee, the Federal Reserve continues to hold two seats on the 
Committee.106

Although Federal banking regulators agreed on the need for 
some  form  of  capital  reserve  regulation  in  the  wake  of  the 
Continental Illinois National Bank collapse,107 they vociferously 
disagreed on the appropriate regulatory solution.108  The Federal 
Reserve’s preferred “risk bucket” approach faced opposition not 
only from the FDIC, but also from the Reagan Administration.109  
To break the regulatory deadlock, Federal Reserve Chairman Paul 
Volcker reached an agreement with his UK counterpart, Bank of 
England Governor Robin Leigh-Pemberton, to endorse the “risk 
bucket” approach.110  This agreement ultimately led to the Basel I 
accord—which endorsed the Federal Reserve’s preferred approach.  
Competing domestic regulators reluctantly acquiesced.111  
The Basel II accord represents another example of successful 
intra-executive policy laundering by the Federal Reserve.112  In 
1996, then-Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan came to 
favor the “value at risk” (“VaR”) model of risk management—a 
view shared by other central bankers, but not by other U.S. banking 
 
regulators.113 Basel II, released in 2001, adopted the VaR approach; 
attempts by the OCC and FDIC to block its implementation in the 
  
United States were ultimately unsuccessful.114 The result of Basel 
II was  that “[w]hat had been a three-way fight among domestic 
regulators . . .  now looked like a quixotic attempt by the FDIC and 
the  [OCC]  to  roll  back  the  advance  of  cutting-edge  risk-
management  techniques  that  were  being  implemented  in  other 
countries.”115 
Neither Basel I, nor Basel II, lends itself to explanation through 
a traditional policy laundering analysis.116  The background to both 
accords  reflects  strong  disagreements  between  Federal  banking 
regulators, rather than a unified position held by the Executive; the

subcommittee hearing on Basel II was subtitled “In Search of a

policy laundering to strengthen its position vis-a-vis other domestic 
banking regulators.118

registration system for works created within the EU.123  Notably, 
major consultation topics included limitations and exceptions to 
copyright (both generally and with reference to specific exceptions 
  
such  as  research,  education,  and  access  for  the  disabled),124 as  
  
well  as  enforcement and intermediary liability.125 One of the key

optional caused problems, suggesting that the Directorate-General 
might be open to increasing the number of mandatory limitations 
and  exceptions.126    Yet  another  Directorate-General  within  the 
Commission  appears  to  have  been  moving  in  the  opposite 
direction.127 
Following the European Parliament’s rejection of ACTA on 
July 4, 2012, Trade Commissioner Karel de Gucht pledged not to 
launder ACTA’s online copyright enforcement provisions through 
the  Transatlantic  Trade  and  Investment  Partnership  (“TTIP”) 
agreement, then being negotiated with the United States:  
ACTA, one of the nails in my coffin.  I’m not going to reopen 
that discussion.  Really, I mean, I am not a masochist.  I’m not 
planning to do that . . . .  If the Commission advances new basic 
legislation,  which  I  think  she  should,  we  will  revisit  the 
question, but I’m not going to do this by the back door.128 
Private statements by officials in the Directorate-General of 
Trade paint a very different picture.  In a closed-door meeting with 
corporate  lobbyists  on  December  5,  2013  on  the  intellectual 
property  provisions  of  TTIP,  Pedro  Velasco  Martins,  the 
Commission’s  chief  intellectual  property  negotiator,  reportedly 
disclosed the existence of a corporate “Christmas list” of intellectual 
property provisions for TTIP that the Commission was working to 
implement,  including  upward  harmonization  of  copyright 
 
protection.129  Velasco Martins reportedly referred to criticism by 
NGOs and the public as “a risk” and considered it desirable to keep 
the  European  Parliament  and  civil  society  “in  the  dark”  about 
   
TTIP’s  IP  provisions.130 The  negotiations  of  TTIP  have  been 
shrouded in secrecy, with copies of the text only viewable by 
national and EU representatives in a secure “reading room.”131

As  with  the  Basel  accords,  an  analysis  purely  in  terms  of 
existing accounts of policy laundering is inadequate.  One could 
argue that the European Commission is behaving as a monolithic 
executive  entity,  and  that  its  public  consultations  and  private 
statements are merely two sides of the same coin—a concerted 
attempt to hoodwink the European Parliament and the broader 
public.  Yet intra-executive policy laundering provides a more 
plausible explanation.   
In particular, several aspects of the Trade Directorate-General’s 
prior conduct in similar trade negotiations point to the existence of 
intra-executive  policy  laundering.    The  negotiation  of  IP 
enforcement provisions in TTIP may exceed the authority conferred 
by  the  negotiation  mandate  given  to  the  Commission  by  the 
European Council; the mandate allegedly prohibits the inclusion of 
 
provisions  on  IP-related  criminal  sanctions.132  Insofar  as  the 
negotiation mandate is ultra vires that mandate, the Commission 
would be at odds with the European Council.  Such behavior would 
be  consistent  with  previous  conduct  by  the  Trade  Directorate-
General, and with bureaucratic politics in  Brussels.  Further, the 
pending EU-Singapore Free Trade Agreement features provisions 
 
that have been copied, almost word for word, from ACTA.133  The

Trade Directorate-General would likely have played a major role in 
the negotiation  of  both  agreements;  it  would  therefore  not  be 
surprising that the Directorate-General would seek to revive the 
failed substantive agenda embodied in ACTA through the inclusion 
of  its  provisions  in  other  instruments.    In  addition,  there  is  a 
documented history of rivalry between Directorates-General and 
failures to coordinate within the Commission.134  Against such a 
background, an account of policy laundering that considers intra-
executive rivalry is more convincing than one that presupposes a 
Commission that speaks with one voice. 
D.  A Counter-Example: When Will an Executive Actor Act 
Alone? 
If the hypotheses in subpart A are correct, an executive entity 
with extensive internal autonomy would have little incentive to 
participate in international institutions.  Doing so would merely 
restrict the entity’s external autonomy, with minor gains in internal 
autonomy  at  best  (and  perhaps  even  a  reduction  in  internal 
autonomy). 
The USTR’s continued use of “Special 301” reports appears to 
bear out this hypothesis.  The Special 301 regime, created by 
Congress  in  1988  as  a  response  to  perceived  inadequacies  in 
international intellectual property enforcement, requires USTR to 
identify countries that do not adequately protect U.S. intellectual 
 
property interests.135  The Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of 
Intellectual Property Rights (“TRIPS”) subsequently incorporated 
minimum standards of intellectual property protection—as well as 
provisions on enforcement and dispute settlement—into the World 
  
Trade Organization framework (“WTO”).136 Yet, despite TRIPS’ 
entry into force—and despite a WTO dispute regarding the use of 
unilateral determinations by the United States137—the USTR has

continued to make extensive use of the Special 301 framework.138  
One plausible explanation is the preservation of internal autonomy.  
Under the Special 301 framework, the USTR enjoys extensive net 
autonomy  in  determining  whether  the  United  States’  trading 
partners adequately protected American intellectual property rights.  
WTO dispute proceedings, on the other hand, would involve a 
reduction in the USTR’s external autonomy with no corresponding 
gain in internal autonomy.  As a result, the USTR had little incentive 
to abandon the unilateral Special 301 mechanism to advance its 
substantive agenda. 
IV. Descriptive and Normative Conclusions 
A.  Descriptive Conclusions 
The above examples (and counter-example) of intra-executive 
policy laundering appear to confirm that the same considerations 
that  result  in  “collusive  delegation”  or  policy  laundering  by 
executives as a whole also apply to individual actors within the 
executive.  To restate the hypotheses stated in Part III.A above: 
1) An  executive  entity  with  restricted  internal  autonomy  but 
expansive external autonomy will be willing to sacrifice some of 
its external autonomy, if this will result in a more-than-equivalent 
increase in internal autonomy; and 
2) Conversely,  an  executive  entity  with  expansive  internal 
autonomy will have little incentive to engage in international 
coordination that will likely decrease its external autonomy. 
As an increasing number of policy areas become the subject of 
international coordination, the collusive delegation thesis suggests 
that a number of consequences will follow.  First, intra-executive 
turf battles will increasingly be waged on multiple fronts.  Not only 
will executive entities compete amongst themselves in the domestic 
arena,  they  will  also  engage  in  a  “race  to  coordinate”  with 
counterpart  agencies  in  other  States.139    Second,  increased 
transnational coordination will tend to favor executive agencies

with more extensive international connections.  Third, the resulting 
intra-executive policy laundering may tend to exacerbate policy 
laundering by the executive as a whole.  Intra-executive policy 
laundering involves one executive entity entering into agreements 
with  its  foreign  counterparts;  once  the  policy  agenda  of  the 
executive as a whole has been set, the international agreement used 
to set that agenda lends itself to policy laundering as against the 
legislature and civil society. 
B.  Normative Conclusions 
The same criticisms that attend traditional accounts of policy 
laundering or collusive delegation also apply to intra-executive 
policy  laundering.    In  particular,  by  giving  an  executive  actor 
control over the power to initiate policy and creating informational 
 
asymmetries,140 intra-executive policy laundering is likely to have 
adverse effects on public participation and transparent decision-
making.  The involvement of a plethora of executive actors, all of 
whom seek to seize policy initiative and keep other executive actors 
in  the  dark,  is  likely  to  exacerbate  the  difficulties  faced  by 
legislatures and civil society in taking (or re-taking) policy initiative 
or accessing information.  Instead of facing one “opponent,” as is 
the case in traditional accounts of policy laundering, such actors 
now face several.  The inability to identify one particular focal point 
for opposition will also make it more difficult for civil society to 
muster opposition to a particular policy allegedly being laundered.  
These developments suggest that intra-executive policy laundering 
makes it easier for one executive agency—in particular, one with 
limited domestic autonomy or legitimacy—to impose its view of the 
common good on other executive bodies, as well as on the public. 
Yet  intra-executive  policy  laundering  may  have  some 
redeeming  virtues.    As  with  traditional  accounts  of  policy 
laundering,  intra-executive  policy  laundering  may  help  achieve 
“beneficial” substantive outcomes, as well as insulate certain policy 
   
decisions  from  domestic  political  forces.141 However,  intra-
executive policy laundering may have its own distinct benefits.  The 
creation of an additional layer of competition between executive 
agencies may help to break the deadlock between multiple agencies; 
in the hypothetical example in Part II.B above, the adoption of any 
 
  140 See Moravcsik, supra note 57, at 7. 
  141 See id. at 60. 274  N.C. J. INT'L L.  [Vol. XLI 
solution would, from a regulatory perspective, be preferable to 
maintaining the status quo.  From the perspective of transnational 
cooperation  and  coordination,  intra-executive  policy  laundering 
will tend to shift the power to set domestic policy agendas in favor 
of executive entities that are already more inclined to engage in such 
cooperation or coordination. 
Nonetheless, troubling questions remain regarding the added 
layers of secrecy and lack of accountability.  Wolf’s suggestions 
regarding a deliberative model of democracy as a means of arriving 
at  a  conception  of  the  common  good—initially  proposed  as  a 
counter  to  the  “new  raison  d’état”  problem—may  provide  a 
 
possible solution.142  However, a detailed exploration of Wolf’s 
proposal—and its adaptation to the more complex landscape of 
intra-executive  policy  laundering—is  beyond  the  scope  of  this 
paper. 
C. Beyond the Language of “Laundering” 
Ultimately,  however,  the  most  useful  contribution  that  the 
literature on collusive delegation can make to the discussion of 
policy laundering—both traditional accounts and intra-executive 
policy laundering—is to provide a more nuanced vocabulary.  The 
language  of  “policy  laundering,”  with  its  reference  to  money 
laundering and its emphasis on advancing a particular substantive 
policy agenda, obscures the underlying objective of institutional 
autonomy  and  presupposes  a  particular  normative  conclusion.  
Although the term “policy laundering” has been singularly effective 
in bringing a phenomenon long discussed in academic literature to 
the  public  consciousness,  further  exploration  of  the  topic  may 
demand  that  we  abandon  the  term  for  other,  more  useful 
terminology.
