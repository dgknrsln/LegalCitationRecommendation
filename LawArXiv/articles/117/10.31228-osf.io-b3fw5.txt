Introduction 
Several  years  ago,  I  ranted  a  bit  online  about  how  younger  American 
intellectual property scholars either have lost the knack of knowing something about 
the history of the discipline or never acquired it in the first place. A few years later, I 
acted on that complaint by compiling lists of what I refer to as “lost classics” of 
American intellectual property scholarship, older papers and books that appear to be 
little known to many contemporary scholars yet that contain the seeds of many 
contemporary ideas. My complaint and my lists first appeared online, as blog posts. I 
have collected them in this Essay so that they might find a new and possibly broader 
audience. 
 
I. One Weakness of Contemporary Intellectual Property Scholarship 
American intellectual property law scholars are, as a group, pretty sociable and 
intellectually generous. Since at least the early 1990s, senior scholars have actively 
mentored, encouraged, and advised junior scholars. As those earliest junior scholars 
have matured, they have often shared those same gifts with the next generation of 
juniors, and so on. One institutional manifestation of that tradition has been working 
papers conferences, the oldest, largest, and most robust of which is the annual 
Intellectual Property Scholars Conference, or IPSC.1  
IPSC has grown in both size and stature. What was originally conceived 
roughly 15 years ago as a relatively intimate setting for presentations by newcomers 
and critiques by senior IP scholars is now an intellectual property free-for-all. I mean 
that mostly in a good way. The conference is very large; the 2013 version featured well 
                                                           
1 IPSC has no fixed online home. The conference rotates among Stanford, Berkeley, Cardozo, and 
DePaul law schools (owing to those being the institutional homes of its original, key faculty sponsors), 
and each host school assembles a program and website associated with that year’s event.

over 100 presentations. Whereas its earliest iterations limited presentations to those by 
junior faculty, IPSC now includes presentations by scholars from all across the 
seniority spectrum. As one would expect of any academic convening, the quality of 
papers  and  presentations  varies  widely,  but  dinner-and-break  conversations  are 
generally very high quality. As a way to track developments in the field, the event has 
few peers. If you have been in teaching any part of intellectual property law for five 
years or less, or if as a senior scholar you pride yourself on tracking the new generation 
of scholarly talent and its work, then IPSC is close to a must-attend conference. 
Size and significance come with costs. Some presentations feature mostly 
finished work, or at least mostly finished paper drafts. But some “papers” aren’t really 
papers at all, but proposals for papers. Some ideas are raw, and some are half-baked. 
Panels are usually multi-tracked; usually, relatively little time is given to any particular 
presenter. While steps are usually taken to discourage people from voting with their 
feet in the middle of a session, people do. Including papers and presentations by well-
established scholars means that juniors can learn from successful models. It also means 
that large audiences for those well-known folks dilute the pool of listeners and 
constructive critics of the lesser-known ones. 
The growth in the size of the conference partly reflects the tremendous 
expansion in the number of scholars teaching intellectual property law over the last 
decade. It also reflects the fact that IP suffers from relatively little of the sclerotic 
hierarchy that characterizes some disciplines. If you’re a junior scholar and want to 
present your work, IP offers at least two fora: IPSC and WIPIP (the Works in Progress 
Intellectual Property colloquium) conference in the Fall. Newer, smaller gatherings of 
scholars presenting and/or critiquing early work, or work by junior scholars, have 
emerged at Drake and Michigan State law schools. IPSC itself has gotten so large that 
work focused on Internet law, which often overlaps with certain parts of IP law, has 
been hived off into its own working papers conference. 
Diversity in paper and presentation quality also follows from a reluctance by 
the organizers to discipline eligibility too harshly. I organized WIPIP myself once, and 
I know well the conflicts that are built into managing a conference of this sort. 
Presenters usually submit and are selected on the basis of abstracts; they are rarely 
pulled from the program if a paper is not eventually forthcoming. To preserve the 
spirit  of  the  conference,  the  organizers  largely  have  to  rely  on  norms  of 
professionalism that suffuse the discipline. 
Those norms don’t always exist, or they don’t always suffuse. Law professors 
who don’t have terminal degrees don’t get trained in the ethos of scholarship the way 
that graduate students are supposed to, so learning an ethos is sometimes a hit-or-miss 
proposition. In IP, with the growth in the field over the last several years, there are a Madison, Lost Classics of Intellectual Property Law

couple of places (in addition to not submitting a paper when an abstract has promised 
one) where the misses are pretty obvious. In what follows, I address some worrisome 
tendencies of (mostly) new and junior IP scholars. 
One – notable but of less pressing concern – is presenting raw and half-baked 
ideas at big public conferences like IPSC. Presenting a work-in-progress does not 
necessarily mean presenting an unfinished work. There are times and places for sharing 
very-early-stage work: with small numbers of trusted friends and colleagues. At brown-
bag lunches. With an Associate Dean for Faculty Development, or a mentor, if there 
is one. At roundtables organized for that purpose. At a big public conference, however, 
the paper may not be in its final form, but the form that is delivered should be final. 
That type of conference is not always a reputation maker, but it can be a reputation 
breaker.  And  the  audience  will  give  better  and  more  thoughtful  feedback  to  a 
presentation that has been evidently thought through than it can to one whose gaps 
are obvious. As always, there are exceptions to the rule; presentation slots at IPSC 
might be usefully deployed as “brainstorming” sessions by presenters. But one worries 
that  in  a  competitive  environment,  with  more  good  proposals  than  slots, 
“brainstorming” uses might displace real paper presentations. 
Two – and my primary interest here – is not being aware of the historical 
context of the work. By far the biggest flaw in presentations and papers by junior IP 
scholars (and sometimes by more senior IP scholars) is their evident ignorance of 
earlier work. And not just or even work published within the last year or last five years; 
I’m thinking of the fact that a lot of foundational work published ten years ago or 
earlier remains significant today. IP doesn’t have a sclerotic hierarchy, but it does have 
senior people who are still active scholars today, and their earlier work still matters. 
And, of course, quite a lot of work from decades ago and scholars no longer with us 
is still relevant today. 
This lack of awareness is not uniform. There are many newer IP scholars who 
demonstrate excellent sensitivity to scholarly context. How to develop this more 
broadly  is  an  important  and  difficult  disciplinary  challenge.  Law  schools  don’t 
automatically teach it. Law review editors are unlikely to require it; conventional law 
review articles are often expected to include summaries of the existing literature, but 
student editors rarely have the knowledge or training to assess them. The echo 
chamber of law review content doesn’t necessarily produce it; article placement tactics 
generally reward authors who overclaim the novelty of their work rather than its 
attention to historical context. Reviews and tenure letters could supply some sense of 
discipline, but the norms currently associated with those letters mean that they do so 
only rarely. Reviewers are often selected, or select themselves, for their favorable views 
of the candidate. Conference organizers could implement more rigorous reviews of 
proposals, but at obvious costs in terms of access to presentation opportunities. Madison, Lost Classics of Intellectual Property Law

Works-in-progress and junior scholars conferences could be structured to reward it. 
More experienced scholars in the field today could volunteer to provide it, both 
publicly and in one-on-one ways. Some do, I know. But much is left to be figured out 
on one’s own, and that leaves important gaps. 
It is possible, of course, that my colleagues are fully informed as to the 
existence and content of older work and choose not to cite it or discuss it. For any 
number of reasons that I won’t belabor here, I think that’s a plausible explanation of 
part of what I read and hear in current work (or, to be precise, a plausible explanation 
of what I read and hear omitted from current work), but far from a complete one. The 
phenomenon is too widespread and long standing. I think that the bigger gap is simply 
lack of awareness of the intellectual history of the field. Filling that gap is what I try to 
do below. 
 
II. Lost Classics, the Rationale 
Off and on during 2009, I assembled lists of key pieces of scholarship and key 
scholars from an earlier era – from the time before IP became a “hot” topic and before 
it acquired a somewhat polished theoretical gloss. I came up with three lists, one each 
for patent, trademark, and copyright law, and at the beginning of 2010 I posted them 
as the “Lost Classics” series on a blog that I run, madisonian.net. These are pieces that 
in my own, possibly idiosyncratic opinion, IP scholars should be aware of, even if they 
haven’t read them. The lists are, necessarily, incomplete and provisional, and they 
reflect some quirks. I’m interested in the intersection of intangible property law and 
chattel property law, for example, so the work of Zechariah Chafee (memorably the 
author of a piece titled “The Music Goes Round and Round”) shows up in the 
Copyright list. I have mostly omitted references to well-known primary sources, such 
as the Statute of Anne, the Statute of Monopolies, the writings of Thomas Jefferson, 
and the speeches of Thomas Macaulay. 
I call these “Lost Classics” with a bit of rhetorical flourish, not because any of 
these works or their authors has truly been lost – many if not most are still cited from 
time to time – but because scholars working in IP today, especially junior scholars, 
would do well to familiarize themselves with these people and their work. That 
includes, in the case of the small number of scholars on these lists who are still writing 
today, their early work. Many of the arguments offered in current scholarship have 
antecedents or were offered decades ago. Conditions change; the fact that an argument 
was offered before does not mean that it is not worth reviving. But the intellectual 
history of an idea is often important. Madison, Lost Classics of Intellectual Property Law

________________________________________________________________________ 
I applied some simple criteria in compiling these lists: The work must have 
been first published in 1985 or earlier. Any cutoff date is arbitrary. I chose 1985 
primarily to avoid contests about whether work by still-active scholars should be 
included. Careful readers will note the presence of early work of some people who are, 
today, leaders in the field. They will also note that the 1985 date means that I omit 
important early work by others. I might have chosen 1987, or 1989, or 1990. But I 
didn’t. Twenty-five years (working backward from 2010, when these lists were first 
posted) is a nice round figure. 
I did not compile a complete bibliography of relevant scholarship from this 
earlier era. I included scholars and scholarship whose work or words, it seemed to me, 
have stood some test of time – or should – or both. (I don’t mean, however, to include 
only work whose arguments anticipate modern equivalents.) Perhaps there are works 
on the lists that don’t belong; no doubt I haven’t included works that do. I did not 
include recent treatises, or casebooks of any kind. Coverage of work published in 
professional journals rather than in scholarly journals – the Journal of the Copyright Society, 
the Journal of the American Intellectual Property Law Association, the Journal of the Patent and 
Trademark Office Society, the Federal Circuit Bar Journal, and the Trademark Reporter, and 
their respective predecessors – is spotty, at best. I did not try to cover scholarship 
published by economists or historians, but some snuck in anyway. And I have not 
ventured to collect older scholarship first published outside the United States. I don’t 
know that literature, and that’s a gap that I hope someone else can fill. 
I was struck by the relatively long list that I compiled for copyright law (no 
doubt due at least partly to my greater personal familiarity with the field) and the 
comparatively short lists for patent and trademark law. Was there really that much 
more early scholarship on copyright law? I suspect not. 
My various errors and omissions will be cured, I hope, eventually in updated 
versions of these lists. A few of the entries on the lists below are based on comments 
contributed to the original posts; thanks to those commenters. I note that one scholar, 
Lisa Ouellette, picked up and extended the “lost classics” theme in a long blog post 
on “classic” patent scholarship in 2012.2
