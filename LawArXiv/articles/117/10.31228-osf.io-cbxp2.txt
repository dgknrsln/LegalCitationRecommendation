Preparing  for  Service:  A  Template  for  21st  Century  Legal 
Education  
Michael J. Madison * 
I.  Introduction 
In May 2013, a group of faculty members at the School of Law at the 
University of Pittsburgh (Pitt Law) was constituted as a Task Force and charged by 
the Dean with investigating innovation and reform and revision of the program of 
Pitt Law in general. I was appointed its chair. We adopted a name – the Innovation 
Task Force (ITF, or simply the Task Force). The Task Force took the Dean’s charge 
in its broadest possible terms, as encompassing the opportunity to sketch a vision 
for the future of the school, its students, and its graduates. 
Roughly one year later, we produced a report that documented observations, 
recommendations, and proposals across the complete range of the law school’s 
program. Quite apart from what has since happened or may happen at our law 
school, we believe that our process and product may hold wider interest for legal 
educators  elsewhere  and  possibly  even  for  innovators  and  leaders  in  higher 
education generally.  
Anecdotally, we know that as a group of law professors charged with 
developing proposals for “innovation in legal education,” we were hardly alone. 
Law schools, other professional schools, and colleges and universities of all shapes 
and sizes face a dizzying array of organizational, financial, demographic, and 
programmatic challenges, and the country (perhaps even the world) is abuzz with 
faculty and administrative activity trying to address them. “Innovation” holds 
enormous  promise  but  is  no  cure-all;  in  fact,  one  of  our  central  if  unstated 
conclusions is that innovation in its own right is no simple solution, and the absence 
of innovation is not alone the problem. Rather, to borrow a phrase, “the models are 
broken, the models are broken,”1 and what is needed – and what we describe below 
– is innovation that produces a conceptual and practical foundation for education

1023 (1986). The late Professor Newell, a leading computer scientist, was commenting on the 
likelihood that conventional patent law concepts could be applied usefully to the relatively new 
domain of computer programming. He wrote that his title evoked either Paul Revere (“The British 
are coming! The British are coming!) or Chicken Little (“The sky is falling! The sky is falling!). In 
either case, he was “sounding a call to arms—to do what it takes to banish the confusion and to 
make a new set of concepts to replace the old.” Id. at 1023-24.

that addresses the needs and goals of contemporary society. Articulating that 
foundation takes imagination. Implementing it takes courage. 
II.  Process 
Academics, like many people, dread the idea of “strategic planning,” which 
connotes consultants, jargon, wasted hours in meetings, and little useful output to 
show for it all. Yet in framing its work, our Task Force borrowed some strategic 
planning  concepts,  and  we  pursued  them  to  what  we  believe  was  and  is  a 
meaningful and productive outcome. Among those concepts was and is the mantra, 
sometimes associated with Dwight Eisenhower’s leadership of the Allied forces 
during World War II, that “it’s not the plan, it’s the planning.”2 Our process 
mattered and matters enormously, not only in terms of arriving at a useful outcome, 
but also in terms of building on that outcome effectively as times and conditions 
change further. 
A.  Research 
The Task Force met with the full-time faculty of the school, one-on-one, in 
small groups, and in large groups; with the adjunct faculty, likewise in a variety of 
settings and combinations; with current students, with alumni, with the school’s 
Board of Visitors, and with law school staff. We solicited suggestions in group 
meetings and in one-on-one conversations. We reviewed in depth the extensive and 
growing literature on changes to higher education, changes to the legal profession, 
and changes to legal education, to other professional education, and to higher 
education in general. We also reviewed a great deal of management literature, 
particularly literature on strategic planning and change management. Two members 
of the Task Force (Madison and Sinsheimer) attended the annual conference 
produced by Educating Tomorrow’s Lawyers (ETL), a legal education reform 
initiative supported by the Institute for the Advancement of the American Legal 
Systems (IAALS) at the University of Denver. One member (Madison) is a Fellow 
of ETL and participates year-round in conversations about the future of law schools. 
                                                            
2 The pithiest version of the quotation is: “In preparing for battle, I have always found that plans are 
useless but planning is indispensable,” quoted in RICHARD NIXON, SIX CRISES (1962).  Eisenhower 
also wrote: “I tell this story to illustrate the truth of the statement I heard long ago in the Army: Plans 
are worthless, but planning is everything. There is a very great distinction because when you are 
planning for an emergency you must start with this one thing: the very definition of ‘emergency’ is 
that it is unexpected, therefore it is not going to happen the way you are planning.” PUBLIC PAPERS 
OF THE PRESIDENTS OF THE UNITED STATES, DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER, 1957, NATIONAL ARCHIVES 
AND RECORDS SERVICE, GOVERNMENT PRINTING OFFICE, at 818 (from a speech to the National 
Defense Executive Reserve Conference in Washington, D.C., Nov. 14, 1957).

B.  Distillation 
  The Task Force worked simultaneously “back to front” and “front to back.”  
“Front to back,” we started with “competencies” literature on expected outcomes 
for law graduates and tried to design curricular and other program innovations that 
would improve our law school’s ability to deliver those competencies.  But we 
recognized from the beginning that this approach was likely to be incomplete and 
potentially ineffective, so we also worked “back to front,” compiling an extensive 
inventory of “big ideas” (and some more modest “middle-sized” and “small-sized” 
ideas), program innovations that faculty members individually (or sometimes in 
small groups) advocated for as part of their own, possibly idiosyncratic visions of 
what the law school should teach and what the law school should do.  We added 
our own ideas, too, from both “front to back” and “back to front” points of view.   
In addition to the Task Force’s outreach efforts, we met roughly once per 
month to review and distill the information into a working template of a proposed 
program, guided by the instinct that we ought to produce something more than a 
list of ideas, large and small, for eventual faculty consideration.  We aimed to shape 
those ideas into a comprehensive vision of what the law school should do.   
At the end of the year, we returned a lengthy report to the Dean and to the 
full faculty. 
C.  Product 
Most of the Task Force’s report is reproduced below in slightly modified 
form.3  The report offers a number of recommendations to the Dean and faculty of 
our  law  school,  sorting  those  recommendations  into  items  concerning  the 
curriculum of the school as a whole, items concerning organization and teaching of 
individual  programs  and  courses,  and  items  concerning  administration  of  the 
school.4  
III.  The Conceptual Framework 
A full statement of our premises appears at the end of this paper under the 
heading “Working Assumptions.” That material can be reduced for now to the 
                                                            
3 The charge to the Task Force included some items specific to Pitt Law that are not relevant to the 
broader review and set of outcomes that the Task Force produced. Those are omitted them from this 
paper. Also omitted are certain specific references to details of the academic program at Pitt Law 
and to the workings of the school’s governance processes beyond what are necessary to introduce 
this paper. In many places, references to Pitt Law have been edited to refer to “the law school,” to 
facilitate possible transposition of ideas from this report into other law school settings. 
4 Not every recommendation represents novelty or innovation relative to legal education as a whole. 
Obviously, the Task Force was building on Pitt Law’s current programmatic baseline.   Preparing for Service: A Template for 21st Century Legal Education - Page 4 of 30

following. In every case, we believe that adoption, implementation, execution, and 
assessment of our recommendations should be guided by this standard:  
Does it inspire? 
Does the proposal inspire the faculty and the staff of the law school to serve 
the interests, needs, and goals of our students and graduates in achieving personal 
and professional success in the changing legal services marketplace? Does it inspire 
students to change themselves and change their clients and communities? Does it 
inspire students to learn and to explore ways that they can develop the capabilities 
to build careers and apply their training to improve communities? 
With that preliminary statement, we turn to: 
THE BIG IDEA 
We believe that it is important to capture the entirety of what we are after 
in a single, comprehensive, inspiring idea. Simplicity and synthesis bring power. 
We  propose  that  the  entirety  of  the  school’s  program  be  captured 
substantively,  organizationally,  and  programmatically  by  the  following  broad 
concept: 
Preparing for Service 
This phrase means that our graduates are headed to careers in service. 
Service must be defined broadly and inclusively. Our graduates may serve clients, 
communities, governments, those in need, and/or society as a whole. Service, in 
our estimation, is a necessary defining attribute of what it means to be a member of 
the legal profession. Our law school – like almost every law school – is directed 
essentially to preparing its graduates to serve. Over a career and over a lifetime, our 
graduates will serve in a host of different places, times, and ways.  
Preparing for service entails, in part, a host of mostly traditional or typical 
activities: Learning substantive law. Learning how to analyze problems critically 
and how to communicate analyses and solutions effectively and persuasively to a 
variety  of  audiences,  including  legal  decisionmakers.  Learning  the  ethical 
frameworks that govern lawyers and others actors in this and other legal systems.  
Preparing for service also entails in part, some novel, even transformative 
activities: 
It means organizing professional preparation in a thoughtful, sequential 
manner, so that activities, skills, and knowledge that are part of a first year of 
learning are applied and built upon systematically in a second year, and the work Preparing for Service: A Template for 21st Century Legal Education - Page 5 of 30 
________________________________________________________________________ 
of the second year is foundational to a third year, resulting in graduates who are 
prepared to serve.  
It means bringing the experiences of service intentionally into the learning 
environment, so that students prepare for service by engaging in forms of service. 
It means equipping students from the beginning of their time at the law 
school  with  tools,  skills,  and  forms  of  knowledge  necessary  to  thrive  as 
professionals and as people, not only as practicing lawyers. This includes social 
skills and emotional skills as elements of professional and personal identity, as well 
as cognitive and “practical lawyering” skills.  
We do not challenge the foundational point that our law school exists to 
train students in law and/or as lawyers. We believe that this framework, even as it 
might be modified by the revisions that we propose below, does not adequately 
capture and advance the sense of purpose and ambition that ought to inform the 
school and its communities. “Preparing for Service” at once is bigger than that 
framework and serves as a more concrete guide to what, precisely, the law school 
and its faculty and staff should do. Our graduates should emerge from law school 
“service-ready,” rather than merely “practice-ready.” 
We  put  “Preparing  for  Service”  into  practice  by  working  from  this 
conceptual idea to increasingly concrete descriptions of what kind of law school 
and what sort of programs could prepare law graduates for service in the 21st 
century. What follows is a sketch that builds from “Preparing for Service” to a set 
of more concrete programmatic themes, from there to a set of attributes that should 
define the law school’s program, to a series of methods to be used in building and 
implementing that program and its parts, and finally to specific programmatic 
recommendations and innovations. For brevity and simplicity, we refer to this as a 
hierarchy of goals. It can be illustrated this way: 
THE BIG IDEA  THEMES  ATTRIBUTES  METHODS  
PROGRAMS 
This hierarchy describes how “Preparing for Service” can pervade and 
infuse all that we are as an institution and as individuals within it. It provides a 
framework that allows anyone – student, faculty member, graduate, member of the 
legal profession – to relate and justify specific programmatic innovations (at the 
most concrete end of the hierarchy) in terms of a well-constructed argument 
grounded in the school’s central mission (at the most general end of the hierarchy). 
Nothing in the hierarchy requires that each and every thing that the school does be 
well-supported in the specifics of every “higher” level, or that every element of 
every “higher” level be implemented throughout every feature of the school’s 
specific programs and courses. It is a framework, rather than a straightjacket. Preparing for Service: A Template for 21st Century Legal Education - Page 6 of 30

________________________________________________________________________ 
A.  Themes 
1.  Legal literacy 
2.  Professional identity 
3.  Cognitive and communication skill 
4.  Professional and personal intelligences 
These are dimensions of our students’ and our graduates’ identities as new 
lawyers who are “prepared for service.” 
1.  Legal  literacy.  This  includes  knowing  the  content  of  the  law, 
including history, purposes, structure, and doctrinal details. It includes possessing 
basic and elementary skills needed to apply doctrinal and structural knowledge of 
the law in practice. 
 
2.  Professional identity. This includes understanding the professional 
and ethical frameworks that govern the legal profession and its individual members. 
It includes understanding the obligations associated with the agency and fiduciary 
concepts that define the lawyer/client relationship. It includes understanding the 
role of law and lawyers in history and society. 
 
3.  Cognitive and communication skill. This includes possessing the 
analytic skills traditionally associated with the phrase “thinking like a lawyer.” It 
includes knowing how to communicate effectively in writing and in person, in a 
broad variety of settings, and with a broad variety of media, and with colleagues, 
clients, adversaries, decisionmakers, and policymakers. 
 
4.  Professional  and  personal  intelligences.  This  includes 
understanding one’s own personal attributes (including cognitive and emotional 
strengths and weaknesses) and understanding those attributes in others and in social 
contexts. This includes motivation, responsibility, professionalism, empathy, and 
self-awareness. 
B.  Attributes 
1.  Accountability 
2.  Transparency 
3.  Progressivity, coordination, integration, and transferability 
4.  Relevance 
5.  Individualization 
These are dimensions of the law school program that are designed to 
promote and produce new lawyers who have the identities described in the section 
on “Themes” and who are “prepared to serve.” Preparing for Service: A Template for 21st Century Legal Education - Page 8 of 30 
________________________________________________________________________ 
1.  Accountability.  The  law  school  and  its  faculty  should  hold 
themselves accountable for determining whether its programmatic goals are being 
achieved and should hold our students accountable for achieving the things that the 
law school sets as its educational goals. The law school program should be defined 
in both respects by a culture of rigor. 
 
2.  Transparency. The law school and its faculty should be explicit in 
describing to students and other audiences and constituencies why it is we are doing 
and teaching what we do. A culture of openness fosters innovation. 
 
3.  Progressivity,  coordination,  integration,  and  transferability. 
The  law  school’s  program  should  be  designed  purposefully  to  promote  the 
transferability of substantive knowledge and professional skills across different 
domains of practice, by integrating or coordinating wherever possible the goals and 
outcomes that are the foci of different courses or academic experiences and by 
building  educational  experiences  explicitly  and  progressively  on  foundations 
supplied in previous education experiences. 
 
4.  Relevance. The law school’s program should be designed to be 
flexible in preparing new lawyers to serve in the contemporary legal profession and 
legal  services  industry.  This  includes  acknowledging  the  changing  nature  of 
modern dispute resolution, which focuses less and less on classic or traditional 
adversarial advocacy. This includes acknowledging the growing role of technology 
in shaping how legal information and legal services are delivered. This includes 
respecting the continuation of at least some forms of “custom” practice, individual 
lawyers working with individual clients.  
 
5.  Individualization. The law school’s program should be oriented to 
teaching and learning on a student-by-student basis, so that each individual new 
graduate is “prepared to serve.” 
C.  Methods 
1.  Problem solving in context 
2.  Experiential learning  
3.  Opportunities to build expertise 
4.  Resource flexibility 
5.  Professional connectedness 
6.  Formative feedback 
These are pedagogical methods and strategies for course, program, and 
curriculum design that are directed to implementing the “attributes” described in Preparing for Service: A Template for 21st Century Legal Education - Page 9 of 30 
________________________________________________________________________ 
the preceding section. Those “attributes” are designed to produce new lawyers, 
defined by the “themes” described at the outset, who are “prepared to serve.”  
1.  Problem solving in context. Classic intellectual frameworks for 
teaching and learning (typified by the question, “what are the parties’ rights and 
obligations in this dispute?”) should remain valued and should be supplemented 
with frameworks for problem solving in context that value and incorporate a broad 
range  of  influences  and  variables,  including  economics,  sociology,  history, 
statistics, and psychology as well as formal law. Training in context should matter 
both at the level of the individual problem and dispute and at the level of theory, 
policy, and positive law. 
 
2.  Experiential learning. Classroom and casebook learning should be 
blended as much as possible with participating in the practices associated with law. 
These experiences should include not only law clinics operated by the law school 
but also classroom-based simulations, internships, externships, and extracurricular 
opportunities to work with institutional and individual partners.5 
 
3.  Opportunities to build expertise. Students should continue to have 
opportunities systematically to develop subject matter, disciplinary, and domain-
specific knowledge. Existing certificate and concentration programs offer examples 
of how this may be accomplished. Opportunities to develop expertise may be 
captured in other organizational forms, including joint degrees and partnerships 
with post-graduate legal incubators and accelerators. 
 
4.  Resource  flexibility.  Organizational  and  bureaucratic  structures 
should be examined for opportunities to support faculty who wish to engage in 
team-teaching, to introduce writing or simulation or other experiential components 
in podium- and exam-based courses, or to innovate pedagogically in additional 
ways. This may include avoiding “the credit hour” and “the course” as mandatory 
and exclusive measures of teaching responsibility.  
 
5.  Professional connectedness. The law school should continue to 
emphasize opportunities for building professional connections among students and 
practitioners, alumni, and other legal professionals into courses, programs, and the 
curriculum. In this context, the purpose of connectedness is professional identity 
formation as well as career development. 
                                                            
5 The Task Force was aware of but was not prompted in its thinking by emerging efforts to require 
experiential learning in law schools in connection with accreditation requirements adopted by the 
American Bar Association Section of Legal Education and under discussion by the State Bar of 
California, among other organizations. Preparing for Service: A Template for 21st Century Legal Education - Page 10 of 30 
________________________________________________________________________ 
 
6.  Formative feedback. The law school should support faculty efforts 
to implement assessment methods other than the traditional end-of-semester exam 
as a single assessment.  
IV.  Programmatic Recommendations 
We divides our recommendations into three parts: 
A.  Recommendations Concerning Curricular Development, which 
is the largest section of this Report, dealing with both general 
suggestions  regarding  the  design  of  the  law  school’s  academic 
program and specific proposals for faculty consideration. 
 
B.  Recommendations  Concerning  Individual  Instruction, 
suggestions directed to individual faculty members who might opt 
to innovate within their own courses or programs. 
 
C.  Recommendations  Concerning  Administration  of  the  Law 
School, suggestions for consideration by the faculty and/or the Dean 
that go beyond the specifics of the school’s academic program and 
its curriculum.  
 
A.  Recommendations Concerning Curricular Development 
 
First we review and recommend a set of broad curricular priorities aligned 
with the overall “Preparing for Service” framework of this paper. This provides an 
outline within which specific proposals may be advanced now and in the future; it 
includes both “infrastructure recommendations” (section 1 below) and a curricular 
overview (section 2 below). Second we propose specific curricular innovations, 
consistent  with  these  priorities.  These  proposals  are  summarized  within  the 
narrative below (sections 3, 4, and 5, addressing the first, second, and third years 
of the JD program, respectively) but are also highlighted separately (section 6). We 
recommend that each of these be submitted to the faculty for consideration and 
possible adoption via existing faculty governance processes.  
1.  The Curriculum in Broad Outline: Infrastructure Recommendations 
Before making specific recommendations, we recommend in general that 
the faculty emphasize a handful of key themes throughout the program with respect 
to both teaching and learning. These themes are broadly consistent with the current 
program’s focus on legal literacy, or substantive legal knowledge and practical 
skills development.  They connect that focus to the broader goal of preparing our Preparing for Service: A Template for 21st Century Legal Education - Page 11 of 30 
________________________________________________________________________ 
students for service by (among other things) highlighting opportunities for students 
to develop their professional identities and providing students with opportunities to 
learn to serve while, at the same time, students learn the content of the law. 
a.  Focus on Competencies: 
The  Task  Force  recommends  that  the  faculty  develop  a  taxonomy  of 
personal, social, and professional “competencies” and match them with individual 
courses, requiring that any course that claims to meet a “competency” requirement 
meets agreed-upon standards as to how the course accomplishes that goal. That 
taxonomy need not be drawn from scratch. The law school already endorses a 
documented set of learning outcomes for the JD program as a whole, and there is a 
large literature on competencies for lawyers to draw on, although much of that 
literature is keyed to the needs of that part of the profession that delivers custom 
services  to  individual  clients.  The  faculty  should  make  explicit  that  “being,” 
“doing,” and “knowing” are equal in stature. High on this list of competencies 
would be knowledge of several substantive legal domains and lawyering skills and 
writing  and  communication  skills  of  various  sorts.  The  list  should  include 
additional competencies that are not so narrowly tailored, including tools now 
included under the heading “emotional intelligence,” leadership, collaboration, and 
teamwork. The faculty could require that students complete a certain number of 
courses that generate “competencies” credits of certain kinds.  
Implementation of this focus could take many forms. For example, a course 
coding scheme could be added to the registration database that would permit faculty 
on a voluntary basis to label their courses with “tags” that are linked to different 
competencies. A course on tax law could have tags that include “tax,” “business,” 
“core,”  “entrepreneurship,”  “legal  writing,”  and  “innovation  concentration,” 
among others. (These are similar to modern Twitter or Facebook hashtags.) Tags 
could relate to specific knowledge- or skills-based “pathways,” “concentrations,” 
“certificates,” “competencies” and/or to “lawyering,” for example. In addition, the 
law school could use those tags to design “clusters” of courses that students 
organize on their own by selecting courses with all relevant “tags.” Students could 
use the tags to design their own curricula and to satisfy various requirements. An 
initial universe of tags would have to be created, but we anticipate that the system 
would evolve and perhaps grow with use.  
b.  Create a Comprehensive Legal Writing Curriculum:  
Specifically as to legal writing, the Task Force recommends that the faculty 
revise the current set of requirements (Legal Writing and Analysis in the first year, 
plus upper-level writing requirements) to encourage students to distribute those 
experiences more evenly over their three years of law school.  The faculty may also Preparing for Service: A Template for 21st Century Legal Education - Page 12 of 30 
________________________________________________________________________ 
wish to consider requiring distribution of student writing across a specified range 
of writing genres (research, advocacy, and transactional among them). 
c.  Offer Opportunities to Partner:  
The  Task  Force  recommends  that  the  faculty  highlight  functional 
interdisciplinarity (law and …, e.g., “society,” “business,” “economics,” “science,” 
etc.) where that interdisciplinarity is present in course and program offerings, with 
the goal of preparing students to work professionally in cross-disciplinary settings. 
The law school should intentionally build out a menu of related courses to cross-
list with other University of Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mellon University6 schools 
and departments and continue to invest strategically in joint degree programs. This 
would encourage and build on partnerships within and across the law school and 
both universities. The Task Force does not offer a recommendation regarding 
whether the law school should embrace interdisciplinarity as a strategic goal but 
does recommend that where interdisciplinarity is part of a program or a course, the 
law school highlight that fact as part of advancing students’ preparing to serve. 
d.  Offer Opportunities to Specialize:  
The law school should offer appropriate opportunities to specialize during 
the JD program as a way for graduates to signal commitment to a field in addition 
to permitting graduates to demonstrate mastery. The law school should develop a 
published list of practice specializations and corresponding groupings of courses, 
programs, and experiential and extracurricular opportunities, perhaps within the 
context of existing concentrations, certificates, and/or pathways but not limited to 
them or by them.  
Task Force members disagreed among themselves regarding the virtues and 
drawbacks of encouraging disciplinary specialization by JD students. 
e.  Highlight Outcomes: 
As a matter of best practices, the law school and individual faculty members 
should document intended student outcomes at the level of each individual course 
(“By the end of this course, each student will be able to do X, or will know X …”), 
at the level of the program (“By completing this concentration, each student will be 
able to do Y, or will know Y …”), at the level of the academic year (“By completing 
the first year at Pitt Law, each student will be able to do Z, or will know Z …”), 
and at the level of the full degree program. The faculty may adopt a graduation 
requirement that requires that each student demonstrate achievement of those

to the University of Pittsburgh. Its campus is roughly one-half mile from the Pitt Law building.  
CMU does not operate a law school. Preparing for Service: A Template for 21st Century Legal Education - Page 13 of 30

outcomes, although the Task Force makes no specific recommendation on this 
point. Evidence in each instance might consist of a portfolio of student work, 
certification by an individual faculty member with respect to a particular student, a 
comprehensive exam, or some other means. 
f.  Hold Faculty Accountable: 
The faculty should hold itself accountable for innovation in pedagogy and 
course content, with the goal of ensuring that individual course and program 
offerings and the law school program as a whole remain relevant and consistent 
with the goal of preparing graduates for service. The Dean might likewise adopt 
measures to hold faculty accountable. Accountability measures should focus on 
positive (reward-oriented) accountability for individual faculty members, rather 
than punitive (failure-oriented) accountability. 
g.  Manage the Curriculum: 
The faculty should undertake a periodic comprehensive, strategic review of 
the course catalog, course design, and methods of assessing effective teaching. 
Questions should include: What are the right course topics? What courses should 
be taught when? How should courses be grouped and sequenced? Future proposals 
for new courses should be justified explicitly in terms of how they advance one or 
more  strategic  goals  for  the  school  (innovative  teaching,  career 
development/placement  for  students,  and/or  areas  of  substantive  focus,  for 
example). The point here would not be to raise the substantive bar for adding new 
courses  but  to  influence  course  and  curriculum  development  indirectly,  by 
requiring that these goals be made explicit. 
h.  Use Flexible Teaching Loads: 
The law school should investigate changing accounting for faculty effort. 
So long as ample time is reserved for the production of scholarship by tenured and 
tenure-stream faculty, and so long as mechanisms are in place for ensuring equity, 
course loads and credit loads need not be standardized across all full-time faculty, 
as they are now. Alternative resource management schemes might include banking 
of courses and/or credit hours, changing the credit hours assigned to a course in 
proportion to the number and type of assessed assignments for students, full credit 
for collaborative teaching, and  incentives/rewards to encourage team teaching, 
collaboration,  cross-listing  courses,  cross-unit  teaching,  and  adding  assessed 
activities for students. 
i.  Expand Reviews of Teaching:  
The faculty should expand the scope of teaching reviews of junior faculty 
and  adjunct  faculty  so  that  the  reviewer  explicitly  considers  course  design, Preparing for Service: A Template for 21st Century Legal Education - Page 14 of 30 
________________________________________________________________________ 
assessment  methods,  readings  and  other  assignments,  and  identification  of 
outcomes  and  success  in  reaching  those  outcomes,  in  addition  to  classroom 
pedagogy. Evaluation of teaching should be consistent with ensuring that every 
course and program at the law school advances our students’ preparation for 
service. 
j.  Prepare Graduates for Careers in Law-related Professions and 
Roles as well as in Law Practice:  
The faculty should build preparing for service in so-called “alternative” 
careers (which are increasingly “mainstream” careers) into course and program 
design.  The  law  school  should  devote  administrative  resources  to  supporting 
students in a diverse range of career aspirations. This serves the needs and goals of 
our students and graduates and the needs and interests of the legal profession and 
the related legal services industry.  
k.  Know What We Know:  
Many faculty members are already experimenting with new pedagogies, 
forms of assessment, and substantive teaching and learning.  Those innovations 
should be documented, inventoried, and promoted to students, graduates, and the 
bar, as well as being made accessible as models for other faculty. In part we want 
the world to know what is going on; in part we want to gather better data (even if 
anecdotal data) regarding what is working in the current curriculum.  
l.  Reward and Add More Support for Existing and Emerging 
Innovation of Value: 
The best way to build a culture of innovation is to recognize and reward 
innovation as it emerges.  
2.  Curriculum structure – Overview of the Three Year JD Program 
a.  Identify Macro Outcomes:  
The law school should be explicit that the first year leads to identified 
outcomes  (including  substantive  knowledge,  practical  skills,  and  elements  of 
professional identity, each of which we would have to specify) that produce success 
in the second year (requiring additional specification), and that the second year 
leads to identified outcomes that produce success in the third year. The law school’s 
current set of Student Learning Outcomes (SLOs) could continue to provide the 
end-point for the three-year JD program, and/or could be used to reverse-engineer 
SLOs for the 1L and 2L year, and/or could be used as starting points for higher-
order/more conceptual or lower-order/more specific outcomes at each stage. At the 
end of the third year, the law school should expect mastery of specified things that Preparing for Service: A Template for 21st Century Legal Education - Page 15 of 30 
________________________________________________________________________ 
are captured in the phrase “prepared to serve.” The entirety of this structure should 
lead to identified outcomes that produce success upon graduation (passing the bar) 
and beyond (beginning a professional career). 
b.  Start  with  a  Broader  Sense  of  Fundamentals  and  Build 
Progressively to Mastery:  
The first year should focus on “fundamental” skills and knowledge. “Skills” 
could and should extend well beyond the standard “legal research, reasoning, and 
writing” skills that are now the skills focus of the first year. (See below for more 
specific recommendations regarding the first year.) The second year should focus 
on consolidating those skills, applying the skills and that knowledge in specialized 
domains, and incorporating experiential learning (as defined broadly, below). The 
third year should focus on applying the teaching and learning of the first two years 
in one or more experiential settings. Looking at this sequence in reverse, the 
experiential opportunities of the third year should explicitly state that they depend 
on (and require) that certain competencies be acquired and demonstrated at the 
conclusions of years 1 and 2. 
c.  Anticipate and Prevent Conflicts:  
In principle this overall structure is consistent with the law school’s existing 
menu of certificates and concentrations, with its commitment to various joint 
degree programs, and with its offering non-JD degree programs (LLM, MSL, SJD). 
Care should be taken throughout, however, to avoid introducing unanticipated 
organizational or conceptual conflicts. 
3.  The First Year in More Detail: Specific Proposals 
Rather than mandate the introduction of any innovation across the board, 
the Task Force recommends that the structure of the first year be revised to 
accommodate innovations supported by faculty members who volunteer to lead 
their  development  and  to  expect  that  those  innovations  will  be  reviewed 
periodically and revised or extended and expanded as appropriate. 
a.  Offer a First year Small Section as a Laboratory for Course and 
Teaching Innovation: 
The Task Force proposes that a single small section (20-25 students) be 
created within the first year class and that the curriculum and pedagogy for this 
group serve as a “laboratory” for programmatic innovation, particularly within the 
first year as a whole, in order to enable the law school to address service-related 
and professional identity-related topics beginning in the first year. The Task Force 
refers to this as a “lab section,” although the faculty and administration of the law 
school could and should consider an appropriate and perhaps better formal name Preparing for Service: A Template for 21st Century Legal Education - Page 16 of 30 
________________________________________________________________________ 
for it. The lab section would be a context where the law school’s existing focus on 
legal literacy (substantive legal knowledge) and core legal writing skills could be 
expanded in ways that highlight the goal of preparing all of our students to serve in 
diverse professional environments.  The balance of the first year class would be 
divided into two large sections and would be assigned the existing required first 
year curriculum.  
The content of the curriculum for the lab section would be grounded in (and 
therefore substitute for) the current required “classic” first year subjects, so that 
students enrolled in this section would be deemed to have completed those subjects 
for purposes of satisfying graduation requirements. The content of the lab section 
curriculum would also displace the separate legal writing and analysis curriculum 
for section students. Students enrolled in the lab section would not complete eight 
separate courses. 
The teaching would be handled in a coordinated (and to some extent 
integrated fashion) by a team of four or five volunteer faculty members, drawn from 
every part of the current teaching faculty (and possibly including student or recent 
graduate teaching assistants and/or teaching fellows) who would teach the entirety 
of  the  curriculum,  including  skills  development  (including  legal  writing  and 
analysis) and identity formation, as well as substantive law.  
Identifying or selecting students to participate would require some careful 
additional thought. Student selection matters critically to effective evaluation of the 
program. Students might be invited to volunteer, or might be randomly assigned to 
the section, or might be given the opportunity to opt out of possible assignment.  
We anticipate that the results of the “lab section” innovation should be 
evaluated for their potential to benefit every student in the law school. “Lab 
section” teaching strategies and successes might be exported to other courses and 
programs, even while the “lab section” remains as-is; the “lab section” mode of 
teaching might be expanded to more of the first year or otherwise. Other options 
might be identified. 
The intended outcomes for the program would be documented in advance; 
the teaching faculty would report progress periodically to the full faculty; and the 
entire program would be evaluated critically after no less than some fixed period of 
time, likely three to four years, and then renewed, modified, and/or expanded.  
This proposal could be adopted in tandem with the first year elective 
proposal (below) or independently of it. The Task Force believes that the first year 
elective proposal should be implemented even if the lab section proposal is not 
adopted and that the lab section proposal should be implemented even if the first 
year elective proposal is not adopted. Preparing for Service: A Template for 21st Century Legal Education - Page 17 of 30 
________________________________________________________________________ 
b.  Offer a First Year Elective:7 
The Task Force proposes that first year students be offered the option of 
taking one three-credit elective course in the Spring semester in addition to their 
required courses. This option would be offered to all first year students.  Students 
would have the option of taking an elective or not taking an elective. 
The number and types of elective courses to be offered would depend on 
faculty members who volunteer either to design original courses (whether solely 
for first year students or for combinations of first year students and upper level 
students) or to add first year students to existing upper level elective courses that 
are suited to that treatment. These courses might be taught by solo teachers and/or 
by teams. We anticipate that between 3 and 5 elective courses would be offered to 
first year students. 
Students who enroll in an elective would complete 17 credits in their Spring 
semester; students who do not take an elective would complete 14 credits. 
The Task Force does not propose that any specific course content be offered 
as a first year elective, or that any particular pedagogy be employed. We hope that 
volunteer faculty would seek to find ways to introduce training in various lawyering 
skills,  including  writing,  fact  investigation,  counseling,  negotiating,  witness 
examination, and problem-solving, and/or also to introduce alternative modes of 
student assessment and student self-assessment. Any faculty members who want to 
offer “lawyering competency” training and/or otherwise innovate in content or 
pedagogy as part of an existing mandatory first year course would be encouraged 
to do so, as they are welcome to do currently. 
We anticipate that the elective portion of the first year might provide an 
opportunity to introduce one or more areas of focus with respect to professional and 
personal intelligences, such as leadership development, business training, and 
organizational awareness and training. 
The long-term vision underlying adoption of the proposal should include 
using some or all of these electives to illustrate the strengths and weaknesses of 
different  models  of  integrating  lawyering  skills,  including  legal  writing  and 
analysis, into “substantive” or “doctrinal” first year courses.  Future outcomes 
might  include,  possibly,  the  eventual  abolition  of  the  distinction  between 
“substantive” and “skills” courses.  
At the option of the volunteer faculty, these elective courses might involve 
team teaching, but there is no specific expectation regarding the composition of 
                                                            
7 Pitt Law currently does not offer first-year students that ability to enroll in any elective courses. Preparing for Service: A Template for 21st Century Legal Education - Page 18 of 30 
________________________________________________________________________ 
teaching teams or pedagogy. Classroom, clinical, legal writing, and adjunct faculty 
could each comprise and/or be parts of teaching teams.  
Any new content added to the first year, whether as an elective course or as 
an added “skills” or other non-traditional component to an existing mandatory 
course, should be subject to appropriate review and assessment by full-time faculty 
members. The review should go beyond what has been traditional “classroom 
observation”  and  should  include  critique  of  the  mode  of  team-teaching,  of 
assessment methods, of proposed readings and activities, and of student self-
assessment.  
4.  The Second Year in More Detail: Specific Proposals 
a.  Build on Strength: 
The Task Force believes that the second year is a real strength of the school 
in terms of pedagogical and curricular innovation and relevance, but that those 
strengths are not as well-known as they could or should be. The Task Force 
recommends that the law school take steps to identify and highlight existing 
innovation in this area and to encourage more of it. 
b.  Develop a Required Experiential Learning Progression:  
The Task Force proposes that the faculty require that each student complete 
at  least  two  “significant”  “experiences”  or  experiential  learning  opportunities 
across the two upper level years. (“Significant” could be defined by credit hours or 
by category of experience or in some other way.) Experiences during the second 
year would be presumptively more likely to be classroom-based; experiences 
during the third year would be presumptively more likely to be live client or field-
based. The purpose of expanding the experiential learning concept across both 
second and third years is to implement the idea of progressivity, from acquiring 
skills and knowledge during the first year to using those skills and knowledge in 
supervised settings during the second year to putting those skills and knowledge to 
“live” use in the third year. The scheme parallels the enhanced legal writing 
progression proposed below.  
As part of this proposal, the Task Force recommends that the faculty 
identify and highlight experiential learning opportunities in the second year and 
foundations  in  the  second  year  for  experiential  learning  in  the  third  year. 
Experiential  learning  opportunities  play  two  related  roles  in  the  second  year 
curriculum. In part they provide, in their own right, important preparation for 
students who are searching for summer positions between their second and third 
years of law school. Necessarily this involves a broad definition of “experiential 
learning,” involving classroom-based exercises and role-playing as well as live-Preparing for Service: A Template for 21st Century Legal Education - Page 19 of 30 
________________________________________________________________________ 
client, team-based, and simulation-based activity. In part they provide important 
foundations  for  more  advanced  and  sophisticated  experiential  learning 
opportunities  to  come  during  the  third  year.  To  the  greatest  extent  possible, 
experiential learning opportunities in the second year should be keyed explicitly to 
building on learning outcomes for the first year and to the serving the needs of 
students in the third year. 
On-site opportunities for which academic credit is granted (whether paid or 
unpaid) should be structured to ensure that they are directly associated with faculty-
supervised learning. The law school may use this theme to drive interest in the 
Semester  in  DC  program,8  pro  bono  engagement  by  students,  and  other 
“specialization” programs.  
The  Task  Force  anticipates  that  this  requirement  would  provide 
opportunities for “classroom” and “academic” faculty to build experiential learning 
dimensions into their courses and programs. 
c.  Restructure the Legal Writing Curriculum: 
The Task Force proposes revising the upper level writing requirements (the 
Upper Level Writing Requirement and the “W” requirement9) to require students 
to complete at least one writing experience during their second year. For many 
students, this will result in completing one writing experience during the second 
year and one during the third year. It is possible that some students would devote 
so much of their third year to experiential learning opportunities that do not satisfy 
at least one of the upper level writing requirements that those students would need 
to complete all of their writing requirements during the second year. Relatedly, the 
law school should encourage development of a greater variety of legal writing 
opportunities for students, even given the diversity that is present already. 
d.  Offer a Revised Legal Profession Curriculum:  
The Task Force proposes restructuring the legal profession curriculum to 
require second-year students to enroll in a Legal Profession course satisfying the 
ABA’s  professional  responsibility  requirement10  and  to  schedule  all  of  those 
courses during the Fall semester. A separate course focused on preparation for the 
                                                            
8 Pitt Law offers its JD students the ability to spend a semester in Washington, DC, serving an 
externship and studying under the supervision of a full-time faculty member located there. 
9 Pitt Law currently requires upper level JD students to complete both a standard long research paper 
(the Upper Level Writing Requirement) and, in addition, at least one course designated “W” in the 
course catalog, meaning a course in which professional writing constitutes a substantial portion of 
the assessed course content.  
10 ABA Standard 303(a)(1). See 
http://www.americanbar.org/groups/legal_education/resources/standards.html. Preparing for Service: A Template for 21st Century Legal Education - Page 20 of 30 
________________________________________________________________________ 
Multistate Professional Responsibility Examination (MPRE) would be offered as a 
Spring elective for second or third year students.  
The Task Force believes that clustering Legal Profession courses in this way 
both would prepare students effectively to engage in the upper-level experiential 
learning sequence proposed above and would provide a foundation for discussion 
of law and ethics topics throughout other law school courses and experiences. 
A Legal Profession elective course offered only to first year students might 
be offered during the Spring semester.  An MPRE preparation course might be 
offered in additional semesters. 
The Task Force discussed some possible extensions of this Legal Profession 
proposal but does not propose them.  Each of the courses referred to in the first 
paragraph above might be titled “Legal Profession,” with a colon and secondary 
text following that title to indicate its specific content and/or any sequencing or 
progressive character related to those courses.  
5.  The Third Year in More Detail: 
The Task Force believes that the third year is likely of greatest value to the 
goal of preparing students to serve if it is viewed primarily as  
  an  opportunity  for  experiential  learning,  in  clinics,  externships,  and 
practicums, and in pro bono public service and even in extracurricular 
settings facilitated by the law school;  
  an opportunity for students to develop mastery of particular skills and/or 
subjects that advance their interest in being prepared to serve. (Those 
opportunities may or may not relate to existing certificate or concentration 
programs  and  may,  for  example,  involve  additional  legal  writing 
opportunities.);  
  an opportunity for students to elect to prepare to take a bar exam. 
Those objectives may overlap.   
The Task Force emphasizes that its proposal regarding experiential learning 
spans the second and third years and that its proposal regarding the legal writing 
curriculum also spans the second and third years. 
a.  Graduates Should Be Prepared for Service:  
The faculty should develop and implement a way to assess and confirm, on 
a  student-by-student  basis,  that  each  graduating  student  of  the  law  school  is 
“prepared for service.” In some respects this idea reflects the basic proposition that 
we as teachers should hold ourselves accountable for the work that we do. In some Preparing for Service: A Template for 21st Century Legal Education - Page 21 of 30 
________________________________________________________________________ 
respects this idea reflects the proposition that no law school should graduate 
students into the world of service who are not, in fact, capable of delivering 
competent services. 
The Task Force discussed a number of ways to implement this idea but did 
not  agree  on  a  best  method,  and  it  does  not  offer  a  proposal  on  this  point. 
Possibilities include: 
  “Confirmatory” experiences, assessments, or certifications for each student, 
possibly at the end of each year, or at the end of the second year, or just 
prior to graduation, much like what medical schools do periodically.  
  An  assessment  or  endorsement  or  a  “sponsorship”  as  a  condition  of 
graduation by a specific faculty member and/or advisor (or by some group 
or committee that is specific to each student), who certifies that the student 
is prepared for service. 
  Some kind of portfolio evaluation, which might be part of either of the first 
two options. 
Any option presents a number of practical and policy choices. In some respect, the 
Task Force recognizes that this level of certification or assessment might be 
redundant, if the law school truly adopts and applies a culture of individualized 
teaching and assessment throughout the JD program that is geared to preparing each 
student to serve. 
The Task Force returns this question to the faculty and Dean for further 
discussion. 
6.  Summary: Proposals for Faculty Adoption 
Actionable items described above are summarized as a list of proposals 
here, in abbreviated form.  
a.  First Year Elective Courses: 
The Task Force proposes that the faculty permit students to take one elective 
course during the Spring of their first year. This would be elective both in the sense 
that students might opt to take or not to take such a course during that semester, and 
in the sense that students who opt to take an elective course would be able to choose 
one from several possible options. All first year students would be given the 
elective option. 
b.  Experiential Learning Progression: 
The Task Force proposes that the faculty require that each student complete 
at  least  two  “significant”  “experiences”  across  their  two  upper  level  years. Preparing for Service: A Template for 21st Century Legal Education - Page 22 of 30 
________________________________________________________________________ 
(“Significant” could be defined by credit hours or by category of experience or in 
some other way.) Experiences during the second year would be presumptively more 
likely  to  be  classroom-based;  experiences  during  the  third  year  would  be 
presumptively more likely to be live client or field-based.  
c.  Restructured Legal Writing Requirements: 
The Task Force proposes that the faculty revise the upper level writing 
requirements  such  that  students  would  have  to  distribute  satisfying  those 
requirements across their second year and third year. For many students, this will 
result in completing one writing experience during the second year and one during 
the third year. It is possible that some students would plan to devote so much of 
their third year to experiential learning opportunities that do not satisfy at least one 
of the upper level writing requirements that those students would need to complete 
all of their writing requirements during the second year.  
d.  Legal Profession Curriculum:  
The Task Force proposes restructuring the Legal Profession curriculum to 
require second-year students to enroll in a Legal Profession course satisfying the 
ABA’s requirement and to schedule all of those courses during the Fall semester. 
A separate course focused on preparation for the MPRE would be offered as a 
Spring elective for second or third year students.  
B.  Recommendations Concerning Individual Instruction 
 
To advance the goal of preparing each and every student for service, the 
Task Force urges individual faculty members to consider adopting any and all of 
the following strategies in their courses and programs: 
1.  Use Team-based Teaching and Learning: 
This would include collaborative teaching with colleagues from the law 
school, from other Pitt units, and from other Pittsburgh-area universities. 
2.  Use Classroom-based Experiential Teaching and Learning: 
This would include simulations, case studies, and participatory student 
exercises, complementing clinical education, externships, internships, and other 
live client-based education. 
3.  Assess Students Using Methods in Addition to or as Alternatives to 
End-of-semester Exams: 
Additional  assessment  methods  may  consist  primarily  of  formative 
assessment directed to oral presentation and advocacy skills, persuasive writing Preparing for Service: A Template for 21st Century Legal Education - Page 23 of 30 
________________________________________________________________________ 
skills,  and  professional  identity  formation  as  parts  and  parcel  of  the  idea  of 
“preparing to serve.” The faculty might consider revision of paper requirements for 
independent  study  and  seminar  papers  that  satisfy  the  Upper  Level  Writing 
requirement. Lots of additional forms of assessment are available and offer a range 
of  benefits  in  terms  of  measuring  student  performance  during  the  semester, 
including mid-term exams, short papers, oral exams, and team-based projects. This 
Task Force urges that every course and seminar include at least two graded 
assessments. One of those could be a final exam. 
4.  Explore Questions Regarding Lawyers’ Roles, and Explore Service 
Opportunities for Students: 
In principle either or both of these approaches could be implemented with 
respect to the subject matter of any course or program. 
5.  Adopt Express Professionalism Standards: 
These could relate to class performance and participation with respect not 
only  to  mandatory  attendance,  preparation,  and  technology  use  but  also  to 
classroom demeanor and timeliness. 
C.  Recommendations Concerning Administration of the Law School 
The  Task  Force  offers  the  following  recommendations  regarding 
administration of the Law School. These are organizational strategies that may be 
implemented without a formal vote of the full faculty and have an overarching goal 
of creating and sustaining a culture that values innovation designed to prepare our 
students, and each of them, for service. The Task Force suggests that the Dean 
consult with the faculty in appropriate ways with respect to moving forward with 
any of these recommendations. 
The Task Force is mindful of the fact that any organizational change implies 
some expense and therefore involves careful consideration of the law school’s 
priorities.  
1.  Make Innovation an Institutional and Cultural Priority:  
To ensure that the faculty remain focused on innovation and adaptation, to 
put “Preparing to Serve” into practice, and to identify curricula, programs, courses, 
and pedagogy that support our goal of assuring mastery by each graduate, the Task 
Force recommends that some institutional role or repository of the Task Force’s 
current mission be created and maintained. 
The Task Force does not share a view regarding the best way to accomplish 
this.  Preparing for Service: A Template for 21st Century Legal Education - Page 24 of 30 
________________________________________________________________________ 
At least one member of the Task Force recommends appointing a member 
of the full faculty to a position of responsibility in connection with implementing 
and monitoring the success of innovative courses and programs for teaching and 
learning. This person might be assigned a title, such as “Associate Dean for 
Innovation” or “Chief Innovation Officer.” A handful of other law schools have 
appointed an “Associate Dean for Experiential Learning.” The position would be a 
fixed term (perhaps three years). Its mission would be to catalyze a culture of 
innovation and impact by the faculty and staff in teaching and other forms of 
program development and execution.  
The position would include a budget that could be used not only to support 
conferences and guest speakers but also to support individual faculty interested in 
developing  new  courses  and/or  new  teaching  methods  and  materials  and/or 
otherwise participating in legal education innovation programs whether at Pitt or 
elsewhere.  This position would supervise periodic review of all teaching and 
curricular innovations introduced following this plan, by working with colleagues 
to develop and apply appropriate standards.  
At  least  one  member  of  the  Task  Force  recommends,  instead, 
institutionalizing  the  Task  Force  as  a  faculty  committee  and  charging  that 
committee with the tasks described above with respect to a particular appointee. 
2.  Use Incentives, Coupled with Accountability:  
The Task Force recommends that the law school offer summer stipends for 
proposals for teaching innovation on a par with summer stipends for scholarly 
innovation and that it consider offering other resources (release time, modified 
teaching  loads,  exemption  from  service,  fellowship  funds)  to  incentivize  and 
reward teaching innovation, including (but not limited to) teaching innovation in 
the  area  of  experiential  learning.  Any  new  incentive  program  should  be 
accompanied by standards and stipulations regarding accountability. That means, 
for example, that the recipient could be required to account to the Dean periodically 
for his or her use of the funds, and that the results to be supported by the funds (new 
courses, new materials, new collaborations, and so forth) could be demonstrated 
and delivered by date or dates specified in the original grant. Recipients would have 
to codify their innovations in some shareable way either by publishing a summary 
or presenting their innovation to the full faculty, or both.  
3.  Leverage the Concept of “Preparing for Service” Throughout the Law 
School:  
The Task Force recommends that the entire law school, not only the faculty, 
be engaged in preparing our students for service. Using existing resources (the 
Director of Administration and staff relationships; the Annual Review process), the Preparing for Service: A Template for 21st Century Legal Education - Page 25 of 30 
________________________________________________________________________ 
law school could promote the several related cultures implicated in this Report:  a 
culture  of  service,  a  culture  of  innovation,  a  culture  of  assessment  and 
accountability, a culture of community (that is, shared vision), and a culture of 
recognition and reward.  Techniques used to advance that idea might also be used 
to advance similar concepts often associated with successful organizations, such as 
a culture of excellence and a culture of gratitude. 
4.  Communicate:  
The Task Force recommends that the law school capture and publicly 
advance a vision of the law school and its faculty and students –- as ambitious, 
accountable impact-oriented innovators supporting our students’ preparation for 
service  –  through  Admissions,  Alumni  Relations  and  Development,  Career 
Services,  and  community  partnerships.  This  would  be  coordinated  through  a 
Director of Marketing and Communications but could be as innovative and up-to-
date in style and execution as the substantive content itself.  
5.  Coach:  
The Task Force recommends that the law school create a corps of alumni 
partners who coach/mentor each and every one of our law students. Some senior 
alumni  recognize  this  as  an  updated  version  of  classic  “preceptorship” 
programming. But the coaching would focus as much on life skills and maturity as 
on professional skills. “Coaching” and “mentoring” could be done informally, on a 
one-to-one basis, and/or in structured groups, as exemplified by Harvard Law 
School’s “Reading Group” program and the “Society Program” at the University 
of Texas School of Law.  
6.  Publish:  
The Task Force recommends that the law school support innovative models 
of publishing and procurement of teaching materials.  Because access to innovative 
course materials is a barrier to teaching innovation, the law school could borrow 
custom  publishing  resources  (such  as  Print  on  Demand  services)  from  the 
University  of  Pittsburgh’s  University  Library  System,  to  facilitate  materials 
development.  Online services are emerging to facilitate inexpensive, custom-
designed, online development of both materials to support “standard” law school 
courses (such as Torts and Civil Procedure) and “novel” law school courses (such 
as interdisciplinary or specialized courses).  
   Preparing for Service: A Template for 21st Century Legal Education - Page 26 of 30 
________________________________________________________________________ 
7.  Leverage Technology and Teaching Resources Flexibly: 
 
  The  Task  Force  recommends  that  the  law  school  provide  resource 
innovation that supports preparing our students for service. Possible approaches 
include: 
 
  Outfitting classrooms – particularly small classrooms – with commercial 
technology  that  supports  virtual  collaboration  with  other  schools  and 
organizations. Collaboration could take one or more of the following forms: 
(i) course offerings co-taught by faculty at other schools in the US and/or 
outside the US; (ii) course offerings to include students at other schools in 
the US and/or outside the US; (iii) scholarly and/or other extracurricular 
events and activities with colleagues and/or students from other schools. As 
much as possible relevant software should be procured from open access / 
open source sources, in order to reduce costs. 
  Providing financial incentives to faculty who want to use technology to 
create wholly or partly “flipped” classrooms. As always, incentives should 
be coupled with accountability mechanisms. 
  Creating a “faculty support team” of law school staff members to serve the 
technology needs of all faculty teaching at the law school, including adjunct 
faculty. This would be something like an in-house “Geek Squad.” 
8.  Strategically Integrate Centers and Institutes:  
The Task Force recommends that the law school consider prioritizing 
strategic  alignment  of  centers,  institutes,  and  other  specialized  programs 
(concentrations, joint degrees, other professional and non-professional degrees, and 
the Semester in DC program) with the overall law school program, with the 
condition that affirmative and strategic support by the school, and continued 
programmatic  autonomy,  comes  with  the  expectation  that  marketing, 
communications, and administration of the centers will be coordinated with those 
of the law school as a whole and its core commitment to preparing each student for 
service. All recipients of law school support need to be “rowing in the same 
direction.”  
9.  Leverage the Law Library:  
The Task Force recommends that the law school encourage the law library 
to master and train students in the emerging technologies of the legal services 
industry, supplementing its traditional role in providing access to legal information. 
Some emerging commentary suggests that the traditional law library is no longer 
as useful to the mission of a law school as it has traditionally been. Our law library 
can build on its existing service orientation and can add new value to the mission Preparing for Service: A Template for 21st Century Legal Education - Page 27 of 30

of the law school by inventing new roles for itself focused on preparing our students 
for service. 
10.  Leverage Career Services:  
The Task Force recommends that the law school consider changes to the 
structure,  purpose,  and  mission  of  the  Office  of  Professional  and  Career 
Development that increases the ability of that office to offer customized job search 
and placement support to each and every law student and to advance the law 
school’s goal of developing each student’s professional identity and preparing each 
student for service in a heterogeneous legal services market. One option might be 
to move toward something resembling a “concierge”-style system along the lines 
of those now being adopted by business schools, because of the increasingly 
heterogeneous market for MBA graduates.  
D.  Proposals and Themes Considered but Not Included in This Report 
This Report specifically and purposefully omits certain things that have 
been much discussed in the literature in general and that were mentioned in at least 
some of the conversations that formed parts of the research of the Task Force. We 
note them here to confirm that the Task Force does not prioritize them as specific 
recommendations at this time.  If resources to support any or all of these become 
available in the future, each of them may be pursued by the School in ways that are 
consistent with this Report. 
1.  Post-JD Incubators and/or Pre- or Post-JD “Captive” Law Firms or 
Incubators:  
The Task Force believes that there should be explicit conceptual space in 
the  law  school’s  program  for  entrepreneurial  efforts  by  faculty  to  develop 
“incubator” programs that would serve students preparing to graduate and/or recent 
graduates,  and  for  related  partnerships  between  the  law  school  and  local 
practitioner, business, and service communities, to the extent that they align with 
the school’s overall “preparing for service” program. 
2.  Capstone Courses:  
The focus of this Report is to guide students to experiential opportunities 
during their third year as much as possible. If a so-called capstone course is part of 
a three-year sequence leading in some specific (i.e., identified) sense to “service-
readiness,” then the course should be included in the curriculum.

3.  Pro Bono Service: 
A dedicated pro bono coordinator and/or pro bono recognition program 
would be consistent with this Report.  A coordinator position could be added easily 
if the faculty and Dean determine that resources should be allocated to such a 
position. 
4.  Revenue-generating Programs:  
The Task Force determined that this topic is too broad and open-ended to 
justify including a full examination here. Four obvious ideas would be (i) so-called 
“concierge”  executive  education  programs;  (ii)  non-professional  certification 
curricula, perhaps in partnership with other University of Pittsburgh units; (iii) 
more aggressive use of so-called “3+3” programs, in partnership with units at the 
University  of  Pittsburgh;  and  (iv)  opportunities  to  develop  special-purpose 
applications or versions of the existing MSL program.  
In  all  cases,  revenue-generating  programs  should  be  evaluated  and 
implemented in ways that provides spillover benefits to the JD experience, in terms 
of substantive programming aligned with the “preparing for service” theme as well 
as in terms of revenue. 
V.  The Task Force’s Working Assumptions 
The literature on the state of legal education and the legal profession today 
is  extensive,  detailed,  and  concrete.  It  contains  a  lot  of  critiques,  ideas,  and 
forecasts, many of them inconsistent in their particulars. But in broad outline, a 
handful of key, shared themes can be discerned. The Task Force began its work 
with those themes in mind. 
We set those themes out here, framing them in terms of law schools and 
legal education in general.  The Task Force believes that each of them applies 
specifically to Pitt Law.  
A.  Everything is changing.  
What we have known for generations as the “legal profession” is evolving 
into the broader domain of the “legal services industry.” Professional norms, 
values, and discipline will remain invaluable to law students and graduates in the 
future, but the proportion of new graduates who build careers as practicing lawyers 
who serve clients is likely to fall and to continue to fall, and the proportion of new 
graduates who use their knowledge and training in other ways, in government, 
business, not-for-profit service, and otherwise, is likely to increase and to continue 
to  increase.  The  pace  and  direction  of  change  cannot  be  predicted  with  any 
confidence.  The risk that change will be rapid and fundamental is considerable. Preparing for Service: A Template for 21st Century Legal Education - Page 29 of 30

B.  What law schools are, and what law schools do, is changing, too.  
Law schools have competition. Not only do law schools compete with each 
other, but law schools compete with business schools and with the idea that college 
graduates need not attend professional school at all in order to build successful 
careers. Competition of both types is likely to get more intense.  That situation 
presents fundamental questions regarding the mission of each law school and the 
roles  of  its  faculty  in  advancing  that  mission  through  curriculum  and  other 
programs. 
C.  The economic structure of legal education is changing. 
Many American law schools have been funded primarily by student tuition. 
As applications and enrollment drop, and with uncertainty as to whether or when 
they might rebound, structural deficits in operating budgets are exposed. Revenue 
falls; expenses remain nearly constant. It is not clear how long parent universities, 
alumni donors, and other potential supporters of a law school will be willing to 
underwrite the operations of law schools that simply maintain the status quo. 
D.  Innovation  and  programmatic  change  must  be  compelling,  even 
inspiring, to students, alumni, and other potential law school partners.  
Looking ahead, few people will want to attend a law school, to donate 
money to a law school (as an outside supporter), or to support a law school 
financially (as an inside, university-based supporter), unless there is a distinctive 
and  compelling  justification  for  that  decision.  Law  schools  need  stories  of 
inspirational impact and change. That relates to changes within law school and to 
changes among students and graduates, all leading to changes in the broader world. 
Inspirational change requires more than tweaking a program to create a specialty 
area, to reinforce skills development, to broaden or narrow the scope of the 
substantive  knowledge  conveyed,  or  to  market  the  existing  program  more 
effectively. Inspirational change begins with a shared set of values and purposes 
and makes its way to implementation and execution by full participation of every 
member of the community in the things that the community believes must be done. 
The assumption that “we are doing everything that we can” must be replaced, via 
the development and application of huge doses of imagination, by the assumption 
that “we will do everything that we are inspired to do.” If a law school and its 
faculty and students are truly inspired, then the marketers and storytellers will have 
plenty of material to work with.  
E.  Every student must succeed. 
The current, default structure of most law school curricula, programs, and 
courses is mass production. We teach to large groups of students and evaluate them Preparing for Service: A Template for 21st Century Legal Education - Page 30 of 30 
________________________________________________________________________ 
often on end-of-semester exams, imposing a curve to sort stronger from weaker 
students but rarely pausing to ensure that each and every student has achieved 
mastery of relevant concepts and skills. That premise should change. We must 
assure mastery by each and every student. In doing that, we should not assume that 
our current program and teaching methods optimally serve any of our students, even 
if many of them transition successfully into the legal profession. A minority of law 
school graduates do not succeed, either because they are not prepared adequately 
to pass the bar exam or because they do not have the skills needed to secure 
professional employment and build a career, or both. Yet we do not know precisely 
what works well and should be emphasized, and what might work better. To figure 
out what form of education best serves every single student, law schools need to 
find ways to build a culture of continuous innovation into their programs. To 
paraphrase President Dwight Eisenhower, who was asked about his plan for the 
Allies in the European theater in World War II, the point of thinking critically about 
law schools is not the plan itself. It’s the planning, that is, creating a culture of 
ambition and adaptation in pursuit of our overarching goal. 
F.  Start small, and build on success.  
The last 15 years of research in management and organizational change 
teaches  that  building  durable,  effective  organizational  change  means  building 
around “disruptors,” “champions,” and “change agents,” individual and small 
group innovators who push the proverbial envelope of accepted behavior in an 
organization  and  model  success  for  the  larger group. The typical alternative, 
designing a plan that includes all stakeholders and respects all interests, then 
implementing the plan and hoping that it succeeds, is in fact not a proven model. 
Cultural change is critical, but culture must grow organically rather than be imposed 
from the top. “Norm entrepreneurship” from the bottom up should be welcome.
