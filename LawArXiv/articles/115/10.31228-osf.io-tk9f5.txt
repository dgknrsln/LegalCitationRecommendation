Introduction
American  regulatory restrictions  on nonprofit  activity  in Cuba have
decreased dramatically over the past three years.1  As a result, interest in
undertaking projects in Cuba among U.S. nonprofits has increased signifi-
candy over that same period.  Despite President Trump's recent directive
that rolled back several aspects of the previous administration's Cuba pol-
icy and ordered new restrictions on U.S.-Cuban engagement,2  U.S. non-
profits  are  unlikely  to  be  deterred  from  seeking  to  expand  their
engagement in Cuba over the long term.  As nonprofits explore potential
opportunities and navigate legal and political challenges, this Article seeks
to advance the conversation3 by answering the following questions: What
is the current state of U.S. and non-U.S. nonprofit activity within Cuba?
What are the Cuban legal and other constraints that affect nonprofit activ-
ity in the country?  What recommendations might we offer to U.S. nonprof-
its that are interested in pursuing work in Cuba, in light of the constraints
identified above?  And finally, what legal, policy or other measures in Cuba
might  help  address these  constraints  and  facilitate  increased  nonprofit
engagement?
It is important to emphasize at the outset that we do not address the
many U.S. laws and regulations governing commercial and nonprofit activ-
1.  On December  17, 2014, President Obama  announced  that the  United States
would "chart a new course with Cuba," making the way for expansion and promotion of
"authorized engagements" and "normalization" of relations.  See OFF. OF THE PRESS SEC-
RETARY,  PPD-43, UNITED  STATES-CUBA  NORMLIZAION  (2016).  See also Megan O'Neil,

3.  We take as our starting point the premise that increasing the foreign nonprofit
activity in Cuba would be a positive development, but we do not explore or set out to
demonstrate the truth of that premise here.2017  U.S. Nonprofit Activity in Cuba
ity by U.S. citizens or entities in Cuba.4  Nor do we explore the impact of
the U.S. government's June 2017  decision to tighten several of the U.S.-
based regulations that had been relaxed over the past three years.  Compli-
ance with these complex regulations will remain both challenging and cru-
cial to successful U.S. nonprofit activity in Cuba.  The focus of this Article,
however, is Cuban legal and other constraints to nonprofit activity within
Cuba.
1.  Current State of U.S. and Non-U.S. Nonprofit Activity Within Cuba
A.  Which Nonprofits are Currently Active in Cuba?
A variety of domestic and foreign nonprofit organizations, both secu-
lar and faith-based, are currently active in Cuba.5  A number of U.S. non-
profit organizations registered in the United States engage in work in Cuba.
The list includes, among others, the American Friends of the Ludwig Foun-
dation, the  Caribbean  American  Children's  Foundation,  the Center  for

§ 321(b); see also 50 U.S.C. §§ 4301-41; 31 C.F.R. § 515.
5.  Our research suggests that there are between thirty and thirty-five foreign NGOs
currently working in Cuba; approximately twenty to twenty-five are American. Of those,
we interviewed staff members from nineteen: B'nai B'rith; the Cuba America Jewish Mis-
sion; Christian  Aid Mission; ECHO  Cuba; Florida  Baptist Convention;  Green Cities
Fund; the Environmental Defense Fund; the Friendship Association;  Fundaci6n Amis-
tad; Hombre Nuevo, Tierra Nueva;  Lutheran Hour; Presbyterian World Hour; Cuban
Association of the Order of Malta; MEDICC; Roots of Hope; the Social Science Research
Council; United Methodist Volunteers Mission; and World Monument Fund. The exper-
iences  of these  individuals  and  their  organizations  are  reflected  in the  discussion

including  Cornell  University6-are  also  active in  Cuba on a number  of
fronts, particularly in the agriculture and life sciences fields.
Nonprofit work affiliated with the Catholic Church is primarily chan-
neled through Caritas Cubana (the largest independent nongovernmental
organization  (NGO)  on the island), which is aided by another Catholic
organization,  Catholic Relief Services (CRS). 7  The Cuban Association of
the Order of Malta, a Catholic religious order, also  maintains projects in
Cuba.8  Protestant faith-based organizations working in Cuba include the
Presbyterian World Mission, the United Methodist Volunteers Mission, the
Baptist Convention, and Evangelical Christian Humanitarian Outreach for
Cuba (ECHOCuba).9  B'nai B'rith and the Cuba-American Jewish Mission

(HE 4020) (which is a Spring Break field lab); Cornell-in-Cuba:C ASA Consortium (with
the  University  of Havana  faculties  of philosophy and  history); and  Cornell-in-Cuba:
Research Program (with the University of Havana faculty of biology).  In addition, Cor-
nell has recently been accepted into IIE's International Academic Partnership Program
(LAPP) Cuba Cohort. The College of Veterinary  Medicine has been approached by the
Egg Nutrition Center to help them undertake a scoping visit and some broad prelimi-
nary research in Cuba on nutrition, health, and food access.  Several colleges, including
the College of Business, the College of Human Ecology, Weill Cornell Medicine and the
College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, offer courses with field work in Cuba.  See

a  national  level,  several  German  foundations,  European  and  Canadian
development agencies,  and foreign embassies directly support projects in
Cuba.16  The Organization of American States, the primary regional organ-
ization for the Americas, does not have a presence in Cuba.17
B.  What are They Doing?
The focus of most foreign nonprofit activity in Cuba-both nongovern-
mental  and  intergovernmental-falls  within  three  categories:  projects
involving cultural activity and exchange; projects  that seek to assist soci-
ety's most vulnerable groups; and projects that promote the country's sus-
tainable development.
U.S. nonprofits  engage  in a wide range  of activities in the  country,
including projects aimed  at strengthening health  care and health educa-
tion,18 improving U.S. and Cuba relations,19 protecting the environment,20
promoting sustainable agriculture and fisheries,21 bringing food and mate-
gramme (UN Habitat), the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR),
and the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO).

43.  Memorandum from Dr. Rolando Suarez  on legal opinions about the following
questions (June 9, 2016).2017  U.S. Nonprofit Activity in Cuba
for domestic nonprofit entities is comprised of the Cuban Constitution (La
Constituci6n de la Reptiblica de Cuba),44 the Civil Code (Cddigo Civil),45 the
Associations  Law  of  1985  (Ley  54  de Asociaciones)  (the  Associations
Law),46  and the Regulation of the Law of Associations  (Reglamento de la
Ley  de Asociaciones de 1986).47
Moreover, a number of resolutions have been approved by the Ministry
of Finance and Prices and the Ministry of Justice to regulate certain aspects
of nonprofit activity in Cuba, namely Resolution 234-2005 (Resoluci6n No.
235-2005),48 Resolution 43/05 (Resoluci6n No. 43/05),49 Resolution 44/05
(ResoluciOn No. 44/05),50 Resolution 45/05 (Resoluci6n No. 45/05),51 and
Resolution  46/05 (Resoluci6n No. 46/05).52  This legal framework applies
to organizations that are based in Cuba, not to foreign organizations  that
engage in Cuba from offices in other countries.
The right to associate is a constitutional right ostensibly afforded to all
Cuban citizens,53 "as long as such association is not contrary to the revolu-
tion."54  Article 23 of the Constitution states that recognized  associations
can hold private property  and establishes that the use and disposition of
such property will be governed by Cuban law, international  treaties, and
the organization's own statutes and regulations.55
The Civil Code provides for different types of non-commercial  organi-
zations.56  Cubans can undertake nonprofit activity through one of three
forms-civil  partnerships,  foundations  and associations57-all  described
in the Code as "entities that, having their own private property, are capable

Civil partnerships (Sociedades Civiles) are created by parties who "bind
themselves to provide money and other goods, or their work, with the aim
of reaching the goals of the partnership, in harmony with its social inter-
est."'59  They require a partnership agreement, in writing, and the partner-
ship must be approved or authorized by Cuban  authorities. In addition,
they must be  registered in the appropriate  registry,60  as  determined  by
law.61  Civil partnerships differ  from commercial  partnerships  described
in the Code of Commerce, in that commercial partnerships are for-profit;
consequently, nonprofit groups cannot use the Code of Commerce as their
legal framework.62 The number of civil partnerships is low in Cuba,63 and
the ones that exist "have strong ties to the institutions and ministries of the
State," operating as a form of organization "that benefits and strengthens
'64
public institutions.
The Civil Code defines  foundations as "ensembles of goods donated
by their former owners to nonprofit activities allowed by the law."'65  As
with civil partnerships,  there are relatively few foundations  in the coun-
try,66  and  those  that exist  often  operate  as  quasi-state  programs.  For
instance, the Fundacidn Escuela Latinoamericanad e Cine is a school, and
the  Fundacin Ntifiez Jimenez  "carries  out  studies  on the  protection  of
nature [.]-67  Arguably the "most important" Cuban foundation is Sociedad
Econcmica de Amigos del Pafs, founded in the nineteenth century.68  Today
it continues to own a historically significant building where it maintains its
69
library.
According to the Associations Law, the third form of nonprofit organi-
zation-an  association-can  only  be  created  to  serve  certain  specified
interests:  science  and technology,70  art and culture,71 athletics, 72  friend-

est."'74   More  than  half  of  Cuba's  approximately  2200  registered
associations are friendship and solidarity organizations.75  Certain activi-
ties traditionally associated with nonprofit activity  do not appear on the
list of permissible interests because they are reserved to the exclusive pur-
view of the government: education, medical and hospital assistance, assis-
tance  to  the  elderly,  and  agricultural  development.76  Associations  are
explicitly prohibited from carrying  out activities that are within the exclu-
sive jurisdiction of the state.77
Associations  can be national,  provincial,  or municipal, according to
the territory where they carry out their activities.78  The Associations Law
does not apply to mass  organizations,79 religious  organizations,  agricul-
tural  cooperatives,  credit  and  service  organizations,  or  other  similar
groups.80  By definition, associations are nonprofit, but they may carry out
certain income-generating activities within the area of their focus.81  They
may receive international funding in certain circumstances, as well as con-
tributions from their members and third parties, provided they have set out
this possibility in their founding  documents and have a bank account in
which they can receive such funds.82
To establish  an association, its founders must request  authorization
from the Ministry of Justice.83  The Ministry of Justice may deny an appli-
cation for any of the following reasons:
a)  failure to comply with the state agencies' requirements;
b)  lack of clear objectives or territory of operation;

relationships between different regions and study their history or culture."  Id. at art. 2

torically, mass organizations are the entities through which the Cuban state has directed
and controlled the growth and management of civil society.  To give one a sense of size,
there are only seven, and a significant percentage of the population belongs to one or
more. It is estimated,  for example, that eighty-five percent of women over the age of
fourteen participate in the Cuban Federation of Women.

f)  failure to produce a document that indicates the rules and norms of the

In  addition  to  Ministry  of Justice  authorization,  statewide  associations
must be approved by the Organo de Relaci6n whose jurisdiction relates to
the field in which the association founders propose to work.85
Once approved, an association must enter into a "relationship agree-
ment" with the Ministry of Justice86 and submit its rules, regulations, rela-
tionship  agreement,  and  other  documents  to  the  Ministry  of Justice's
Associations  Registry  (Registro de Asociaciones), which has a branch  in
every province of the country.87  The function of these branches is to main-
tain the legal documents and books of the association.88  The Ministry of
Justice exercises  supervisory  power over  associations89  and  can impose
sanctions if associations do not comply with the law.90  Moreover, associa-
tions must keep accounting records and prepare monthly financial state-
ments.91  Both state and local governments are entitled to request copies of
92
association  financial statements.
2.  Foreign Organizations
Foreign NGOs in Cuba have no legal personality except in partnership
with duly organized Cuban entities.93  Even in cooperation with such enti-
ties, they have to follow  a  certain process  to be able  to carry  out their
projects.94  In a chapter on NGO participation in Cuban civil society, Alex-
ander Gray outlined the process that foreign NGOs must follow to partner
with a Cuban organization:
The foreign NGO comes to Cuba and contacts either the state through the

kind of partnership they will establish, including a work program."  Suarez, supra note

Ministry of Foreign Investment and Economic Cooperation) or more often a
Cuban NGO directly; the foreign NGO cannot engage in any activities of its
own but has to have a Cuban partner; the Cuban NGO proposes a project to
the foreign NGO;  the foreign NGO brings the finance and technical  assis-
tance in the form of a field representative; the Cuban NGO offers the people
and expertise to carry out the project; the Cuban NGO goes to the state to
get what are known as the "terms of reference" for the project; once the state
gives the terms of reference, the project can start.  The Cuban NGO is sup-
posed to go to MINVEC with a project proposal and secured funding from a
foreign NGO.  The MINVEC  will evaluate  the project and give its criterios
(judgment), outlining the conditions under which permission for the project
will be granted.  Determining  the terms  of reference  for  a  project is the
state's way of getting involved in the direction a project will take.  Once the
project is approved, the Cuban NGO can interact with all the local actors,
including the People's Council, people in the municipality, various govern-
ment agencies, and so on.95
We have not found a legal authority that supports this explanation of the
process, but  academic papers,96  Dr. Suarez's legal  analysis,97 and other
philanthropic organizations  active in Cuba,98  offer a similar account.
One  change to the process  described by Gray is the dissolution  of
Minvec and the assignment of its nonprofit oversight functions to the Min-
istry  of  Commerce  and  Foreign  Trade  and Investment  (Ministerio del
Comercio Exterior y  la Inversi6n Extranjera or Mincex).99  In addition to
approval by Mincex, projects must be approved by the Cuban ministry that
oversees the substantive field in which the proposed project will occur, as
well as by the Ministry of Foreign Relations (Ministerio de Relaciones Exteri-
ores or Minrex).10  This three-ministry process  can be cumbersome  and
time-consuming.  According to Dr. Suarez, the cooperation partnership is
most common in two fields:  (a)  "support health services (with a partner-
ship subscribed by the Ministry of Public Health)";  and (b) "agricultural
development,  subscribed  by  a  state  organization  that  unites  farmers
(ANAP), formed by the owners of the agricultural lands and heavily  con-
trolled by the Ministry of Agriculture."101
Beyond partnerships,  some lawyers have  suggested that foreign non-
profits  or NGOs  might use the Cuban  "cooperative"  form in  the future.
Traditionally  associated with  agricultural  production, cooperatives  have
also  been  authorized-experimentally-for  organizations  in  some  other
sectors regarded as valuable to the State, such as recycling, construction to

improve  housing  infrastructure,  tailoring  workshops,  and  animal  hus-
bandry.10 2  The  non-agricultural  cooperative  form  "requires  specific
authorization by  the city council  of the municipality,  the council  of the
province, the Ministry that controls the specific activity, a commission of
the central government and finally, an authorization by the central govern-
ment."103  The activity of non-agricultural  cooperatives  is (currently) for-
profit.104  It is not clear whether the government would authorize a non-
profit or-if not-whether a for-profit entity could intentionally operate so
as to not make any profits. Nor is it clear whether operating as a for-profit
entity (even  one  that did not actually  generate  profits) would  affect  the
foreign nonprofit's status at home in the United States).105
D.  Who Funds U.S. Nonprofit Activity in Cuba?
In addition to traditional  funding  sources, U.S.  nonprofit organiza-
tions interested  in working with  Cuban partners in Cuba may apply for
funding from  a variety  of governmental  and nongovernmental  organiza-
tions, including:
The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), a U.S. govern-
mental body, has supported projects that increase the ability of Cubans
to participate in civic affairs and improve human rights conditions  on
the island.106  A  discussion  of the  challenges  associated  with using
USAID funding is set out in section II.B.

grants to  projects  developed in  Cuba in  the areas  of arts,  academia,

105.  U.S nonprofits must be careful in this context.  Nonprofits must not engage in
conduct is that is contrary to their domestic "status" or purpose. Very generally, then,
they have two options for partnering abroad.  (1) Domestic charities may receive funds
earmarked for a foreign nonprofit or foreign non-profit activity, but only if the domestic
charity retains control over the funds and considers the foreign project to be consistent
with its charitable purpose.  In other words, the domestic nonprofit must have a great
deal of control  over the foreign activity.  (2)  Alternatively,  a domestic nonprofit may
form or partner with a for-profit subsidiary, but in order to maintain charitable status,
the non-profit cannot exert any direct control over the for-profit entity.  So for example,
the nonprofit  cannot be involved in the  day-to-day management  of the subsidiary or
control the for-profit subsidiary's board of directors.  See IRC § 368(c) (2015)  and 26
C.F.R. § 1.512(b)-1(1)(4)  (2016).  Transactions between the nonprofit parent and for-
eign for-profit entity must be at arm's length.  See I.R.C. § 4958(a)-(c) (2015).  This
suggests that U.S. nonprofits wanting to form or partner with for-profit Cuban entities
could not exercise control over the Cuban entity's activities or risk their tax-exempt sta-
tus at home.

Miami have funded "sister" parishes throughout Cuba.132  Usually this is
done with a license, but sometimes this funding occurs "under the table"
(e.g.,  priests from the island visit Miami and return home with funds).133
These sister-parish  funds help Cuban churches to remain open and well-
maintained,  and to provide charitable assistance  to the needy.  Likewise,
hometown  organizations  (called  municipios) send clothing, schoolbooks,
and similar items to Cuba.  These donations are often substantial and are
generally not included in official remittance rates.134
II.  Legal and Other Constraints Affect Nonprofit Activity in Cuba
A.  What Are the Cuban Legal Obstacles to Nonprofit Activity in Cuba?
Although  the  Cuban  government  has  opened  its borders  to  (con-
trolled) foreign investment in recent years,135  foreign nonprofit organiza-
tions that do work in  Cuba still  confront  a host of legal  and practical
difficulties.  U.S.-based  nonprofits,  which  the  Cuban  government  views
with a degree of skepticism, often face particular obstacles.'36  In this sec-
tion, we first  discuss challenges  faced by  all nonprofit organizations  in
Cuba; we then look at the challenges that affect international and, espe-
cially, U.S. nonprofits.
1.  Legal Constraints on Nonprofit Activity in Cuba Generally
Under  the Associations  Law,  it is very  difficult to  establish  a  new
organization.  First, a new organization  may be formed only after demon-
strating that no existing organization serves its same purpose.'37  If there
is an overlap in purpose with another organization, and the founders of the
proposed organization wish to work for that purpose, the founders of the
proposed organization must join the preexisting organization.138  This cre-
ates  nonprofit  monopolies  and  can  severely  limit  the  possibility  of
expanding the number of nonprofits in the country.139  In addition, even if
the government terminates an organization's registration, no other organi-
zation may be constituted with the same name or even with the same (or

similar) goals and activities.140  Finally, absent a waiver by the Ministry of
Justice,  an organization's  founders must number more than thirty mem-
bers at the moment of creation.141
The process for approval  intensifies the difficulties presented by the
rules. Even where more than thirty founders wish to form an organization
for a unique purpose, government approvals are highly centralized and dis-
cretionary.  The ministries with which organizations  must create a Rela-
tionship  Agreement  or  partnership  do  not  have  the  power  to  decide
whether a request will receive approval.142  Ministries may serve as a link
and are necessary to the process, but the final decision rests with the cen-
tral government, in its absolute discretion.143  Dr. Suarez suggests that the
process of obtaining government approval to register as an association is
the greatest challenge that exists for nonprofit activity  in Cuba.  He sug-
gests that, "in order to achieve an acceptance by the government, the con-
tent of the activity carried out must be interesting for them."144
Similar  challenges  emerge  when  associations  decide  to undertake  a
new project, often in collaboration with a foreign NGO.  According to Gray:
[SItate approval for a project comes easily for some Cuban NGOs and with
more difficulty for others.  Some NGOs report waiting only a few weeks to
get their terms of reference from the state, others report waiting up to one
year without getting them.  Evidently, the state is cautious in approving cer-
tain social development projects, taking all the time necessary to ensure that
the project is in keeping with the overall goals of the revolutionary socialist
45
project.1
He  notes  that "in practice,  this means that  neither  foreign  nor Cuban
NGOs act independently; the state is always close by, monitoring and man-
aging all resources that come into the country."'146
In thinking about  what might be  "interesting" or acceptable  to  the
Cuban government, examples are instructive.  According to one researcher,
"the  Government  gives  no legal  right  to association  to  democracy  and
human right[s]  groups."147  A 2016 report by Freedom House states that
"independent racial advocacy or civil rights organizations  are illegal, and
no autonomous women's or LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender)

organizations  are recognized  by the state,"148  although rules prohibiting
such activity are not explicit in any legal text.  Moreover, activities consid-
ered by the regime as counter-revolutionary are prohibited.149  The regime
labels such activities as "against the National Security" or even "terrorist"
as justifications for refusing to grant the requisite approvals.150
Given the difficulties presented by working within the law, it is per-
haps unsurprising  that some nonprofits do not seek formal recognition.
Gray cites Caritas as an example of one such organization.151  But working
on the island for a lengthy period of time-even carrying out projects in
permitted areas-is not a path to recognition.  Without official recognition,
civil society  groups cannot operate legally, maintain a bank account, own
their own office, hire Internet service, or access international funding.152
Additionally, there can be severe consequences  for participating in certain
kinds of nonprofit activity without legal authorization.  According to Free-
dom  House,  "the government  will  not register  any  new  association  or
organization  that is not supervised  by the state.'53  Nearly all politically
motivated short-term detentions in recent years have targeted members of
independent associations, human rights groups, political parties, or trade
unions.154  For example, systematic repression has continued against the
peaceful  and  public  activities  of unauthorized  civil  and  human  rights
groups."l15
The legal  barriers and challenges  for nonprofit activity  in Cuba are
rooted in the particularities of the Cuban social and political context.  Min-
istry of Justice officials have acknowledged the need for a more flexible law
governing the regulation of associations  but, to date, the National Assem-
bly has not considered an amendment  to the Associations Act.156  There
are diverse opinions within the Cuban Government on whether nonprofit
work should be encouraged, or even permitted, within a communist state.
This ambivalence is evident in the government's approach to the approval
process.  While some  officials believe  that the  government  should com-
pletely control NGOs, other officials advance the view that nonprofits can
aid in the development of socialism.157  Gray notes that a "lack of consen-

sus regarding the usefulness of NGOs results in the state having no clear
policy  for their  management."'158  Ultimately,  it is almost  impossible  to
carry out development projects without the support of the Cuban govern-
ment, and "[u]nless you're close to the government, being registered and
recognized  by Cuba is unthinkable."' 59
2.  Legal Constraintso n Foreign or U.S. Nonprofit Activity in Particular
The legal constraints  on nonprofit activity in Cuba discussed above
pose significant barriers for U.S. and other foreign nonprofit organizations
that would seek to establish a permanent legal presence in Cuba.  Several
representatives  of U.S.  nonprofits noted  that no American  organizations
maintain an office in Cuba. Gail Reed, the co-founder of MEDICC and its
Cuban Country Representative, makes Havana her home base as a journal-
ist-a status regulated but legal under both Cuban and U.S. law-since she
writes for and edits the journal, MEDICC Review.  She noted, however, that
MEDICC, like  other  U.S. organizations,  "is not in  Cuba in the sense of
having an office or anything like that. That isn't possible at this time."' 60
Instead,  U.S.  organizations  generally  must  establish  a  partnership
with a government-recognized  Cuban institution or entity and receive spe-
cific government approval for the project they plan to undertake.' 6'  Even
with the assistance of a Cuban partner, the legal barriers to nonprofit activ-
ity  are considerable.  Approval processes are protracted and opaque;  and
state interference is common and presents challenges for foreign nonprof-
its and their Cuban partners; foreign nonprofits are legally and practically
dependent on their Cuban partners; it is difficult to bring needed supplies
to the island; local employment laws make it difficult for foreign entities to
hire Cuban employees;  and Cuban immigration laws make it difficult for
foreigners  to obtain work visas.
a.  The Approval Process
Many  of the nonprofit  staff members we interviewed  noted that the
Cuban  government's  permissions  process  for partnership  with a  Cuban
entity can be lengthy, cumbersome and confusing.  It is often difficult to
navigate the bureaucracy  and determine what the law requires in order to
secure approvals.  Even when legal requirements are met, approvals may
not be granted.  Denials are often inferred from the government's lack of
response rather than being understood through a reasoned rejection.

161.  Gray, supra note 95, at 166-67.2017  U.S. Nonprofit Activity in Cuba
i.  Mincex
As discussed above,162  the Cuban government has recently updated
its rules for foreign entities  and the Ministerio del Comercio Exterior y la
Inversi6n Extranjera (Mincex) has taken on the role of overseeing foreign
philanthropic activity on the island. This role was previously performed by
Minvec.163  Mincex was created in 2009 by merging the Ministry of Foreign
Trade  and  the  Ministry  of  Foreign  Investment  and  Economic
64
Cooperation.'
Daniel Whittle, Senior Attorney  and Senior Director  of the Environ-
mental Defense Fund, noted the updated rules may require greater over-
sight from Mincex,165 but said that he had not yet observed any effects of
the  change  from  Minvec  to  Mincex  oversight  in  practice.' 66  Another
source suggested that Mincex's attitude towards foreign nonprofit activity
exhibits the same posture of skepticism held by its predecessor, and that
this skepticism  is the main source  of delay in  the process  of obtaining
Cuban  government  approval  of  foreign  philanthropic  collaboration  in
Cuba.' 67  For example, in at least  one case,  procuring  Mincex approval
took over two years.168  The fact that the process is onerous and uncertain
creates tremendous disincentives for U.S. nonprofit activity.
ii.  State Interference
The Cuban government's control over foreign organizations' activities
may compromise  the  ability  of foreign  nonprofits  to work  closely  with
Cuban partners and the communities they seek to support.  First, the aid
structure  creates a barrier between  the nonprofit  and its intended  audi-
ence.  According to the UNFPA director in Cuba, all aid provided by their
organization and other UN entities has to pass through Mincex (and previ-
ously, Minvec).169  Thus, the UN agency never has direct contact with the
communities it aids.  As a result, the agency is not able to monitor how the
development  work  is actually  being  carried  out.' 70  One  imagines  this
would not be acceptable to many nonprofits.
Second, the primary  goal of many  existing Cuban nonprofits  is the
protection  of the central government or state.' 7'  In order to obtain and
maintain permission to work in the NGO space, they avoid to competing

with, or substituting  for,  the government in any sense.  This posture is
likely  to be a significant  obstacle for some U.S.  nonprofit organizations.
Additionally, several of the nonprofit representatives we interviewed noted
that, because of the government's strict oversight and difficult permissions
process, Cuban groups tended to be cautious about entering into partner-
ships  with  foreign nonprofits,  especially  U.S. nonprofits.  By  and large,
they are only willing to do so if the benefit to their work is abundantly clear
and the alliance does not threaten their relationship with the state.
b.  Dependence on Local Partners
In the current legal framework, U.S. nonprofits must depend on local
partnerships if they want to be in Cuba.  Many interviewees explained how
they  had  developed  close  relationships  with  Cuban  organizations  and
emphasized how essential these relationships  are  to successful nonprofit
engagement in Cuba.  Among other things, U.S. entities rely on supportive
Cuban partners to provide guidance on Cuban law, including how to work
around  strict legal requirements.  Tom Miller of the  Green Cities  Fund
recalled, "One  Cuban [partner]  said to me, 'Where  everything is illegal,
everything is legal.'  There may be laws on the books but what happens in
practice is different and depends on good relationship with people who
know what to do."172
Formally, the requirement that foreign entities partner with a Cuban
nonprofit may be met by creating a partnership with the Instituto Cubano
de los Pueblos (ICAP),  an organization historically identified as the Castro
regime's primary mechanism for handling international donations. 173 The
ICAP's stated aim is to secure foreign funds and assess development priori-
ties in the country, and invest the donations where they believe it is most
necessary.174  But creating such a partnership with the ICAP comes with
significant costs.  These partnerships are not an appealing option for orga-
nizations that want to actually carry out defined projects in specific com-
munities, or that do not trust the Cuban government to invest their money
as they planned.175  The  ICAP has been  described as  having  "no trans-
parency at all," and money given to it is not accounted for unless there is a
formal agreement requiring such an accounting.176  Some have suggested
it has links to Cuban Intelligence.177  Accordingly,  most U.S.  nonprofits
prefer to work with local NGO partners.
c.  Importation Laws and Bringing/Sending Materials to Cuba
A nonprofit organization or partnership that seeks to carry out a con-
struction project must first obtain a construction license, which requires

approval by a  governmental  projects agency.178  Once  the organization
receives  a license,  it must  acquire the necessary materials.179  Typically,
they must acquire the materials through a contract with the state agencies
that supply them, and those supplies are limited.'80
Importing goods is considered the exclusive  function of the Cuban
state.' 8'  Only  certain  government  agencies  are  authorized  to  import
goods, and there are extensive rules governing the materials and amounts
that can be imported.'82  The Ministry of Construction has  a subsidiary
that manages this procedure for construction projects.'83  "Both the law
and a specific  regulation  of the Ministry of External  Commerce  (Resolu-
tion No. 50) allow the Ministry [of Construction] to authorize" the impor-
tation of construction materials  if it is  in the  state's  interest.'84  "This
resolution has been used to execute collaboration projects."'85  Both joint
ventures and foreign capital companies may obtain, at the moment of their
creation, certain allowances for importing goods, but they are not usually
granted permission to acquire import construction materials  or machin-
ery. '86  In the field of hotel building, however, the government has author-
ized  some  joint  ventures  that  will  build  and  run  hotels  to  import
construction materials or machinery.'87  These activities, however, are for
profit,  and nonprofits  may  find it much  more  difficult  to obtain  such
authorization.
Restrictions on importing goods into Cuba have also made it difficult
for some U.S. organizations  to send materials as donations to the island.
Alberto Jones, President of the Caribbean American Children's Foundation
and Vice President of the Friendship Association, explained that customs
regulations  have tightened in recent years to  such an extent that, "it isn't
easy to send donations.  You need to provide information about everything
ahead  of  time,  what  you  are  sending,  what  brand,  what  year  it  was
made....  [and] the serial numbers...  You can't get that information from
donors in advance,  so it is very difficult."'88  Other nonprofit representa-
tives noted that customs officials have often held up or intercepted materi-
als sent to Cuba.
In addition to these importation constraints, the U.S. embargo makes
it  doubly  difficult  for  U.S.  nonprofits.  Transporting  large  quantities  of
material from the United States is currently restricted,'8 9 so U.S. projects

d.  Cuban Employment Law
Cuban employment law creates challenges for nonprofit organizations
that wish to hire Cuban employees.  Several interviewees noted that legal
restrictions  have  prevented  their  organizations  from  hiring  a  Cuban
employee to contribute to their organizations' work.  In order to legally hire
staff, a foreign  organization must go through a Cuban  state agency and
follow a suite of Cuban rules regulating virtually all aspects of the employ-
ment relationship, including how much the employee will be paid.191 For-
mally, a Cuban state agency hires employees and determines who can be
hired.192  The  foreign  entity pays the Cuban  agency  for the employee's
work in convertible Cuban pesos, but the employee receives nonconvertible
Cuban pesos at a rate determined by the Cuban agency.193  By some esti-
mates, the  Cuban  employee  may receive  as little  as  two  percent of the
amount the foreign employer pays the Cuban agency for his or her work.194
In economic terms, this means the Cuban employee may receive as little as
the hard currency equivalent  of $6  per month, even  though the foreign
employer has paid the Cuban state agency $150. 195  For foreign nonprofits
that are philosophically opposed to paying workers such low wages, these
restrictions pose a significant obstacle.  Faye Miller-Pettway of Fundaci6n
Amistad  explained  that  her organization's  American  staff responded  to
these challenges by making frequent trips to Cuba to carry out the organi-
zation's  work and  relying  on  Cuban  colleagues  only  as  volunteers,196
which raises its own set of concerns.

e.  Visas
Several nonprofit representatives suggested that visa requirements for
visitors to Cuba are restrictive, posing a challenge for their organizations'
work.  Multiple-entry visas are not available, so staff members of U.S. non-
profits must apply for a new visa every time they want to visit Cuba.197  In
addition, visas  are granted  only  for specific,  approved purposes, which
presents a  challenge for project  development.198  Daniel Whittle  of  the
Environmental Defense Fund noted that nonprofit staff members may find
that Cubans are unwilling to meet with them to explore potential projects if
the staff members lack the proper visa.199  He suggested that travelling to
Cuba for a conference  is often the best way to network and explore pos-
200
sibilities for collaboration.
B.  What are the Non-legal Challenges for Nonprofit Activity?
In addition to the legal constraints outlined above, nonprofit organiza-
tions must grapple with financial, technical, cultural, and other challenges
as well.  In practice, these challenges are often just as much of a hurdle as
any other to valuable nonprofit engagement in Cuba.
1.  Procuring Supplies/Infrastructure
First, nonprofit organizations working in Cuba face a number of basic
infrastructure  challenges.  A lack of technological supplies in the country
makes it difficult to carry out certain projects related to energy and scien-
tific research.201  Similarly, as noted above, a dearth of construction mater-
ials such as steel, beams, and doors, presents a barrier to nonprofits whose
projects include construction of some sort,202 and importing those goods
is very difficult.  Moreover,  the lack of communication infrastructure cre-
ates challenges for managing projects internationally.  For example, Cuban
citizens  do  not  have  direct  access  to  an  Internet  connection,
because-according to the company that delivers it, ETECSA-it is not per-
mitted to provide its services to individuals, only to institutions.203

2.  Banking Services
According to many of the non-profit representatives we interviewed, it
is also difficult for American nonprofits to spend money in Cuba.  Histori-
cally,  U.S.  restrictions have been  a significant part of this challenge, but
Cuban obstacles are also significant.  For example, according to Dr. Suarez,
"[tihe Decree-Law that constitutes the Central Bank of Cuba does not have
any disposition that denies foreign participation, but in every case it must
be a [for-profit] function. '204  This poses difficulties for nonprofit organiza-
tions seeking to set up a bank account in Cuba.
3.  Cuban Government's Continued Distrust of the United States
The Cuban government's  distrust of U.S.  organizations  and founda-
tions presents a significant political challenge for U.S. nonprofits.  In light
of historical attempts by USAID and others to foster regime change through
civil society in Cuba, the Cuban government and many Cuban people sus-
pect that other  U.S.  organizations  have similar motivations.205  This dis-
trust is likely  to be  heightened  by the United  States' recent  rollback of
Obama-era  policies  that  had  loosened  restrictions  on  Cuba  travel  and
trade. How organizations are funded will continue to be important to the
Cuban government.  While Cuba is clearly suspicious of USAID funding,
nonprofit representatives  suggested that other government funding, even
by the National Science  Foundation, can raise questions as well.
Even  organizations that do not receive U.S.  government funding are
subject to the vicissitudes of the unstable relationship between Cuba and
the United States.  Tom Miller of the Green Cities Fund recalled how a local
government committee, whose permission was essential to a project that
his organization and its Cuban partners were planning, had abruptly can-
celled a meeting that  Mr. Miller had travelled  from  the United  States to
attend.206  He later learned that the central government in Havana ordered
the cancellation  in response to reports  about a USAID  project aimed at
turning hip-hop performers  against the government.20 7
Some interviewees  noted  that, under the Fidel Castro regime,  Cuba
lacked a history of philanthropy  and independent civil  society organiza-
tions, and suggested that this too contributes to the distrust of U.S.  founda-
tions  and nonprofit  organizations.  In addition,  the  Cuban government
particularly distrusts and is unlikely to permit nonprofit work that focuses
on human rights, democracy,  or other politically sensitive topics.

future. Id.2017  U.S.  Nonprofit Activity in Cuba
4.  Limited Capacity Among Potential Local Partners
Another challenge is found in the opening up of Cuba itself. Although
some  organizations  described  the  pace  of  change  as  slow  and partial,
others  commented  on the  uncertainty  created  by the  rapidly  changing
legal, institutional, and bureaucratic  context.  In addition, a number of the
nonprofit  representatives  we  interviewed  noted  that  recent  changes  in
Cuba have led to a flood of requests for partnerships from U.S. nonprofits
and academic institutions.  They explained that Cuban organizations  and
institutions lack the capacity  to handle all  of these requests,  let alone to
engage in all of these new proposed partnerships.  Moreover, the number of
partnership  requests have  overwhelmed the government and slowed the
permissions process.  In this context, MEDICC Country Director Gail Reed
suggested, "Projects  are most likely to be successful if they are  economi-
cally or socially beneficial for Cuba .. .[and] based on exchange and col-
laboration.'208  It is critical that a U.S.  organization interested in working
in Cuba pursue projects that are initiated by Cubans or valuable to its pro-
posed Cuban partner.209
Conclusions and Recommendations
A.  What Recommendations  Might We Offer for U.S.  Nonprofits that are
Interested in Pursuing Work in Cuba in Light of the
Constraints Identified Above?
As  U.S.  nonprofit organizations  undertake  new  or expand  existing
work in Cuba, a number of factors will affect their likelihood of success.
These factors include the organization's field of work, their structure, and
their relationships  in the country.  Drawing from our research and inter-
views with representatives of nonprofit organizations, we offer several rec-
ommendations for U.S.  nonprofits  that may be interested in working in
Cuba in the future.
First, with the caveats that we identify in the conclusion below, non-
profits should focus their energies on activities that broadly align with the
Cuban government's strategic priorities.  Priorities include, among others,
environmental protection; economic development within the socialist con-
208.  Telephone Interview with Gail Reed, Co-Founder, Country Dir. and Exec. Editor,
MEDICC (May 24, 2016).
209.  It is important to think about "what the value is you are proposing to add.  Often
people just want to conduct research and have access to data.  Often they fail because
there is no value from the Cuban perspective.  What is most successful is to have some-
thing concrete to offer to Cuban partners."  Telephone Interview with Daniel Whittle,
Senior Attorney  and  Senior Dir.,  Cuba  Project,  Envtl.  Def. Fund  Uune  16,  2016).
Soledad Pagliuca, Sec'y  of the  Friendship Ass'n., added that  nonprofit  organizations
"should look for projects that spring from the Cubans' initiative and are not imposed by
our ideas of what is good for them."  Telephone Interview with Soledad Paghuca, Sec'y,
Friendship Ass'n. (May 23, 2016).  She noted, however, that once Cuban partners pro-
pose a project, "they are often hesitant to object to suggestions the foreign nonprofit
organization makes about how to execute it."  Id.Cornell International Law Journal Vol. 50
text;  health  care  improvement;  and  artistic,  cultural,  and  scientific
exchange.
Second, setting up a subsidiary in Cuba does not seem to be a practi-
cally viable option (for now); however, if this were to change,  the Cuban
subsidiary would need to have at least thirty members and meet the other
requirements of the Law of Associations.210  In particular, the subsidiary
would need to link its projects to the categories that the Associations Law
contemplates ("scientific, cultural, artistic, athletic, friendship and solidar-
ity, and any others that promote goals of social interest") and ensure that
no other organization is engaging in similar work in the area.211
In addition, nonprofit  activity in  Cuba is relatively expensive,  from
relationship  building  with  people  in  Cuba,  to  navigating  the  various
approval and other legal processes, to covering project expenses.  Lengthy
and expensive bureaucracy is one of the reasons why small organizations
decide not to invest in Cuba.  In general, organizations  should avoid rely-
ing on USAID  funding and instead seek support from other sources that
are not seen to be political.
A nonprofit organization that wishes to work in Cuba for the first time
should learn as  much as possible  about the political, cultural, and legal
context of the country.  It is important to acknowledge  Cuban strengths,
and a colonial north/south posture will not be successful.212  It may be
valuable to consult with other U.S. organizations that have a long history of
working in Cuba, as well as with Cuban organizations  and legal experts.
Attending academic  conferences in Cuba can be a useful way for a non-
profit leader to learn about the current issues in a given field of work, net-
work, and explore possibilities for collaboration, all while abiding by the
terms of his or her visa.
Critically,  a U.S.  nonprofit must  establish strong  personal relation-
ships in Cuba.  It should seek partnerships with Cuban organizations; ide-
ally those that have experience working with foreign nonprofits and good
relationships with both the Cuban government and local communities.  It

212.  Because  foreign NGOs typically bring money and expertise to projects, while
local NGOs  develop and implement them, the danger is that the relationship can look
more like donor-recipient than partner-partner, but it would be a mistake to assume that
is always the case.  In addition, it is important to remember that Cuba is a country that
not only receives but provides aid, especially in the areas of medicine and education.
According to Dalhousie professor John Kirk, for example, "[als of January  2015 there
[were] 51,847 Cuban medical personnel (of whom 50.1% are physicians) working in 67
countries [...] To put this in context, approximately 20% of Cuba's doctors are working
abroad as internacionalistas.  This would be the same as having 223,000 US doctors
serving in developing countries." Letter from John Kirk, Chair and Professor of Latin
American Studies, Dalhousie Univ., to Norwegian Nobel Comm. (Jan. 19, 2015), http://
resumen-english.org/2015/07/nobel-peace-prize-nomination-for-cuban-medical-intema-
tionalism-program/  [https://perma.cc/GV7W-WK6F].2017  U.S. Nonprofit Activity in Cuba
is not enough to simply identify a partner and agree to work together.  The
U.S. organization also needs to build trust among its Cuban collaborators.
This requires honesty, transparency, and humility, as well as an ability to
approach  any  challenges  that may  arise with patience,  persistence,  and
flexibility.  Lack of strong relationships, inadequate knowledge of Cuba's
communities and traditions, and insufficient understanding of the bureau-
cratic approvals process can frustrate a nonprofit's planned activities.  On
the other hand, a strong institutional partner can help the foreign nonprofit
to navigate the permissions process, understand and comply with Cuban
legal requirements, and ultimately succeed in its work.
A successful  partnership  and project also depends  on the U.S. non-
profit's ability to pursue projects that follow from the initiatives of Cuban
partners and are clearly valuable to its partner(s), the Cuban Government,
and the communities that the project seeks to benefit. The U.S. nonprofit
must also  demonstrate  what it can offer  in particular,  distinct from the
benefits of collaboration  with any  of the numerous  other  organizations
seeking to work in Cuba.  Academic research projects and other proposed
work that does not have a clear collective benefit for Cubans are unlikely to
succeed.  Taking adequate time to establish relationships and listen to the
needs and goals of prospective partners is always important to establishing
effective  cross-national  collaboration.  In Cuba,  relationship  building  is
absolutely essential, particularly in light of the recent flood of partnership
requests that Cuban organizations  and institutions have received.
B.  What Legal, Policy or Other Measures in Cuba Could Help Address
these Constraints and Facilitate Increased  Nonprofit
Engagement?
Since 1959, U.S. nonprofits have faced substantial obstacles to operat-
ing in Cuba.  The limitations imposed on U.S. nonprofit activity in Cuba
by the U.S. embargo made Cuban legal restrictions and challenges some-
thing of a secondary concern.  But as U.S. nonprofits have expanded their
engagement in Cuba, a  trend that may be  slowed but is unlikely to be
reversed  by  new  regulatory  restrictions,  internal  Cuban  obstacles  have
come to the foreground.  With that in mind, we have identified a few steps
the Cuban state might take if it wishes to encourage broader foreign non-
profit activity in Cuba.213
213.  China has recently taken steps to regulate nonprofit activity in mainland China.
CHINA LAW  TRA'SLATE,  2016 PRC LAW ON THE MANAGEMENT  OF FOREIGN  NoN-GovERN-
MENTAL ORGANIZATIONS' ACTIVITIES WITHIN MAINLAND CHINA (2016), http://chinalawtrans-
late.com/2016-foreign-ngo-law/?lang=en  [https://perma.cc/9MPV-2W9G].  One  might
argue that the China example could provide a useful model for law reform advocates in
Cuba because  China is struggling with one of the same key questions facing Cuba,
namely, how to reconcile a communist state with NGO nonprofit activity at a conceptual
level.  Notwithstanding any similarities, however, we are of the view that it would be a
mistake for  Cuba to move in the direction undertaken by China in this space.  The
China NGO Law was enacted as part of broad national security law reform (contra social
welfare  or business law reform, for example),  and its focus and tenor  are to strictly
regulate foreign nongovernmental activity under the threat of severe penalty.  And whileCornell International Law Journal Vol. 50
Association Formation: First, if Cuba wanted to make foreign nonprofit
activity easier, it would have to alleviate some of the strict requirements of
association  formation.  Most  obviously,  the  fields  of work  considered
appropriate for associations should be expanded; the minimum number of
members  should be lowered or eliminated; the requirement  that prospec-
tive  organizations demonstrate  a different purpose from that of all other
registered organizations should be abolished; and the bases on which regis-
tration will be denied should be clearly articulated in the law.  The govern-
ment  might  also  consider  a  mechanism  for directly  registering  foreign
nonprofits in Cuba rather than having  them form new associations.
Partnership  Approval: We also  recommend that the Cuban  government
consider undertaking a review of the current approval process for collabo-
rative  projects  undertaken  by  foreign nonprofit  organizations  and their
Cuban partners.  This review might consider ways to streamline and expe-
dite the approval process, while ensuring that it becomes more predictable,
transparent, and fair.  All requirements and procedures should be spelled
out  in  advance  and  made  available  online.  Those  procedures  should
include  clear timelines  for reaching a  decision.  The government  should
report its decisions in writing and provide reasons for a negative decision,
rather than relying on silence to signal denial.  It should provide opportu-
nities for organizations  to appeal negative decisions.  Substantial weight
should be given to the opinion of the Cuban partner organization or insti-
tution that the project would be valuable for Cuba and its people.
A number  of other discrete  legal changes would similarly encourage  the
engagement of U.S. and other foreign nonprofit organizations in Cuba.
Imports: The Cuban government could consider relaxing restrictions on
the importation of goods required for nonprofit activities, including con-
struction materials.
Banking: Cuba could facilitate the ability of foreign nonprofits to estab-
lish a bank account in Cuba by issuing clear and transparent procedures
providing a new legal framework arguably reduces current uncertainties, many of the
obstacles or barriers  facing foreign  nonprofits in Cuba-both legal  and extra-legal-
would not be resolved by enacting something similar to the new China NGO Law. For
example, the China law institutionalizes and cements government involvement in NGO
activity, which may have a chilling effect on such activity.  Id. Penalties for noncompli-
ance are unduly harsh, and one assumes that as a practical matter, they will act as a
disincentive to innovative nonprofit activity.  Id.  Moreover, it seems that the simplest
way for continued engagement will be through partnership with a Chinese nonprofit
NGO (which is already possible in Cuba).  Finally, regulation inevitably means shining
a light on previously un- or under-regulated activity, and NGOs currently operating in
China without formal legal recognition will undoubtedly come under scrutiny and may
need to alter their current  practices and assume heightened burdens under the  new
China NGO Law.  Given the uncertainties of the new law, and the potential for serious
penalty, enactment may have the effect of reducing nonprofit activity.  For more infor-
mation about the China NGO Law, see HOGAN LOVELLS, CHINA'S NEw LAW ON FOREIGN

through  which such accounts  may  be  established and  removing  the
requirement that foreign accounts have a profit-making purpose.
Visas: The Cuban government  might consider  allowing individuals to
apply for and receive multi-entry visas. This would afford valuable flexi-
bility to staff members of foreign nonprofit organizations so that they
could travel to Cuba on short notice when a  project-related  issue or
opportunity arises.  It would also be useful to expand the purposes for
which visas may be obtained to include travel to Cuba for purposes of
exploring and developing potential projects.  This would ensure that the
leaders and staff of foreign nonprofits are able to take the time to learn
about the local context of the work they are contemplating and listen to
the concerns of potential partners and local communities, so that their
proposed work might closely match Cuba's interests and needs.
C.  Conclusion
Over the past several years, steps towards the normalization  of U.S.-
Cuban  relations  and the  Cuban  government's  interest  more broadly  in
gradually  opening its borders to international actors have presented new
opportunities  for U.S.  nonprofits  to  expand  their engagement  in  Cuba.
This expansion is likely to continue over the long term, despite the barriers
presented by the United States' recent reinstatement of limitations on Cuba
travel and commerce.  Cuban law and policy and the approach of nonprofit
organizations themselves will continue to play an important role in shaping
the direction of U.S.  nonprofit engagement in Cuba.
The  Cuban  government's  consultative  document  (lineamientos),214
which, since 2010, has provided the basis for reform, recognizes a need for
innovation in certain areas, suggesting that Cuba is likely to be receptive to
"innovative  programming,  especially  economic  fairness,  educational
opportunity, gender, metropolitan  opportunities[,]  and sustainable devel-
opment."215  Gender inequality and reproductive health are problems that
have been officially recognized in the country, which make them issues on
which  the  Cuban  government  may  be  receptive  to  nonprofit  engage-
ment.216  On the other hand, one source reported challenges in getting gov-
ernment approval for work relating to sexual orientation.217  The nonprofit
representatives we interviewed consistently identified environmental pro-

It is important to note that the Cuban government is not receptive to
foreign nonprofit engagement on certain topics such as human rights and
democracy.218  Race is also a sensitive subject that the Cuban government
tends to avoid.219  It may, however, be possible to work on discrete human
rights issues-such as human trafficking-that are of interest to the Cuban
government if approached in a collaborative way.220  Framing the project is
especially  important when tackling some  controversial issues.22'  Never-
theless, it is unlikely that Cuba will relax its control over social develop-
ment  activity  in  the  country,  nonprofit  or  otherwise.  U.S.  nonprofits
interested in undertaking new activities  in Cuba should understand that
focusing on areas other  than those identified as priorities by the Cuban
government will affect their likelihood of success.
Nonprofit organizations already operating in Cuba advise that organi-
zations should direct efforts to solving the problems that the country faces,
and  should  become  knowledgeable  about  Cuba's  specific  needs  and
goals.222  In other words, activity should be directed for the benefit of Cuba
and Cubans, not simply to advance the mission or agenda of the nonprofit
itself.  Groups with a proven track record of work in Cuba may be able to
push the envelope into sensitive areas that would be off-limits to newcom-
ers.223  Organizations interested in engaging in nonprofit activity in Cuba
will need to make their own cost-benefit  assessments with respect to how
far to push the limits in determining which activities the Cuban govern-
ment is likely to allow and how much to accommodate  themselves  to the
Cuban government's priorities and sensitivities.
In the end, what came through in our research is that the Cuban non-
profit space is tightly managed and difficult to navigate.  While they were
not the focus of this project, the foregoing  discussion raises a number of
important questions.  Why is it so hard?  Why are U.S. nonprofits not more
welcome or "successful"?  What's at stake?  Are these obstacles for obsta-
cles sake, as might be the case if motivated primarily by anti-Americanism,
retaliation (vis-a-vis the embargo), or resistance (to U.S. imperialism)?  Or
is there a deeper story (or stories) here?  What could politics or economics
or history tells us about how the law operates in this context?  All of these
questions provide fruitful avenues for future research and reflection.

221.  As an example, "Projects framed as nurturing new spaces for 'diversity and toler-
ance' are likely to get more traction than those insisting on 'rights' language[,] .. .[and]
[pirojects  that understand  the  importance  of 'dialogue  and  consensus-building'  to
reform are more likely to have success than those which envision 'advocacy and opposi-
tion' as paths to constructive change."  Bronfman, supra note 16,  at 25.
