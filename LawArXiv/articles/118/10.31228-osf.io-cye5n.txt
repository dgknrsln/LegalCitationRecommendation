implemented standards. 
A related point: while our primary focus was on standards 
that would be fully implemented in our hypothetical laptop, 
we also included some standards that would be directly used 
by our hypothetical machine, but that are not necessarily 
fully implemented on the client side (e.g., basic Internet 
standards like IPv4, DNS or TCP).  This involved some 
judgment calls and line drawing.  Similarly, we included 
standards related to some basic software applications (e.g., 
OpenXML), but tried to avoid expanding too far “up the 
stack” into the software application world.   
Another issue: our data are imperfect.  The authors bring

expertise.    Understanding each of our various technical

certainly no one doubted the importance of standards to

device is striking.  We believe that as technological

consortia, and analyzing the implementation of standards 
produced  by  different types,  strikes us  as  a  fascinating 
research question.  
Additionally,  assessing  each  of  our  identified  standards 
against various criteria of “openness,” along the lines of Per 
Anderson’s recent study [2], could prove quite interesting.  
Our working theory is that the development and distribution 
processes associated with a significant percentage of the 
successfully-implemented standards we identified would not 
meet  typical  definitions  of  openness,  transparency  or 
consensus  decision-making.    If  true,  this  would  be  an 
interesting  data point to  bring into, e.g., current policy 
debates over “good practices” for consortia, such as the 
current BSI PAS 98 effort.  Further, it would be interesting 
to consider whether the empirical data could demonstrate 
either  a  positive  or  negative  correlation  between  the 
“openness”  of  a  standards  development  effort  and  its 
effectiveness as measured by widespread implementation of 
that standard in the commercial marketplace. 
*  *  * 
The academic literature on standardization often bemoans 
the dearth of empirical analysis of standards.  Our hope is 
that the analysis documented in this paper helps to fill this 
gap,  and  enables  policymakers,  academics,  commercial 
stakeholders and others to better understand ICT standards 
and industry specifications.
