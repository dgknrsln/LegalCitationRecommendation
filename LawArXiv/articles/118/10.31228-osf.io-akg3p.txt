  Sex-selective Abortion Bans are Not 
Associated with Changes in Sex Ratios 
at Birth among Asian Populations 
in Illinois and Pennsylvania   
  Abstract :  Legal prohibitions on sex-selective abortions are proliferating in the 
United States. Eight state legislatures have banned abortions sought on the basis 
of the sex of the fetus, 21 states have considered such laws since 2009, and a 
similar bill is pending in U.S. Congress. These laws have been introduced and 
enacted without any empirical data about their impact or effectiveness. Prior 
studies of U.S. Census data found sex ratios among foreign-born Chinese, Korean 
and Indian immigrants were skewed in favor of boys, but only in families where 
there were already one or two girls. Using the variation in the timing of bans in 
Illinois and Pennsylvania as natural experiments, we compare the pre-ban and 
post-ban sex ratios of certain Asian newborn children in these states over 12-year 
periods. We then compare these ratios with the sex ratios of Asian newborn chil-
dren in neighboring states during the same period. We find that the bans in Illi-
nois and Pennsylvania are not associated with any changes in sex ratios at birth 
among Asians. In Illinois and its neighboring states, the sex ratio at birth of Asian 
children was not male-biased during our study period. On the other hand, the 
sex ratio at birth among Asians in Pennsylvania and its neighboring states was 
skewed slightly in favor of boys, but the enactment of the ban did not normalize 
the sex ratio. This strongly suggests that sex-selective abortion bans have had 
no impact on the practice of sex selection, to the extent that it occurs, in these 
states. This finding is highly relevant to legislative and policy debates in the 
U.S. Congress and state legislatures where sex-selective abortion laws are being 
considered.

1     Introduction 
 A preference for sons and the practice of sex selection have been documented in 
many countries in Asia over the past century, including China, India, Korea and 
Taiwan ( Park and Cho 1995 ;  Sen 2003 ;  Lin et al. 2008 ;  Zhu et al. 2009 ;  Ebenstein 
2010 ;  Jha et al. 2011 ). Sex selection has resulted in very high male-to-female sex 
ratios in these countries ( Das Gupta and Shuzhuo 1999 ;  Das Gupta et al. 2003 ). 
The abortion of female fetuses is one method by which parents ensure they have 
a boy-child. 
 Recent studies have shown evidence of slightly male-biased sex ratios among 
the newborn children of foreign-born Chinese, Indian and Korean parents in the 
United States ( Almond and Edlund 2008 ;  Abrevaya 2009 ;  Egan et al. 2011 ). These 
findings suggest that when these parents have two female children, they may 
preselect to ensure their third child is a boy.1       There is no way of determining, 
however, whether abortion is used as the method of sex selection in these cases. 
Indeed, studies relying on census data alone cannot isolate the methods used 
for sex selection, which may take the form of abortion or pre-implantation tech-
niques, such as sperm-sorting and genetic diagnosis. 
 In recent years, pointing to the practices of a very small segment of the U.S. 
population (  <  0.01%), opponents of abortion have pushed for the introduction of 
bans on sex-selective abortion in numerous states. Since 2011, Arizona, Kansas, 
North Carolina, North Dakota, Oklahoma and South Dakota have enacted laws 
prohibiting sex-selective abortions.2       Twenty-one other states have considered 
such laws since 2009.3       In 2008, Republican Trent Franks introduced the Susan 
B. Anthony Prenatal Nondiscrimination Act in the U.S. House of Representatives 
(H.R. 7016). The act would have instituted a federal ban on sex-selective abortions

 “ to prohibit discrimination against the unborn on the basis of sex or race, and for 
other purposes.”   The act died in committee, but was reintroduced several times. 
In 2012, lawmakers in the House of Representatives voted 246 to 168 in favor of 
the bill. However, it failed because it was considered under rules that required 
a two-thirds majority. The act was reintroduced by Republicans in the Senate in 
January 2013 (S. 138) and in the House in February 2013 (H.R. 447). Votes have not 
yet been scheduled on the two bills. Opponents of the bans on sex-selective abor-
tions in the United States argue that the laws will reduce access to abortion and 
stigmatize Asian-American women ( McDonough 2013 ). 
 To date, we are not aware of any empirical literature on the impact of sex-selec-
tive abortion bans in the United States. Prior to the recent legislative campaigns by 
anti-abortion groups, Illinois and Pennsylvania prohibited sex-selective abortions 
in 1984 and 1989, respectively.  4     This study is the first to evaluate the effectiveness 
of the bans in these two states, using the variation in the timing of the bans as a 
natural experiment. We use historical annual birth data from the National Center 
for Health Statistics (NCHS) during 1978 – 1994, and utilize difference-in-difference 
(DID) and triple difference (TD) regression frameworks that compare newborn sex 
ratios across different ethnic groups before and after the bans in Illinois and Penn-
sylvania. Outcomes in Illinois are compared with its neighboring states Wisconsin, 
Iowa, Missouri, Kentucky and Indiana during 1978 to 1989. Outcomes in Pennsyl-
vania are compared with its neighbors New York, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, 
West Virginia and Ohio during 1983 to 1994. We employ several alternative econo-
metric techniques to check the robustness of our findings.  
2    Data 
 We use publicly available NCHS data from 1978 to 1994.5       The NCHS collects annual 
cross-sectional data related to childbirth in the United States. Although the scope

of the surveys has expanded over time, information collected generally includes 
demographic characteristics of the parents, birth history, antenatal and postnatal 
care, and health outcomes of the newborn. Prior to 1972, NCHS only captured a 
50% sample of all reported births. Since 1985, a full 100% of reported births in all 
states are captured by NCHS surveys, effectively making it a census. 
 The NCHS survey started reporting the races of parents in 1978. From 1978 to 
1991, only four categories of Asian races were reported: (1) Chinese, (2) Filipino, 
(3) Japanese, and (4) other Asian or Pacific Islanders.6       The last category included 
Asian Indians and Koreans. Beginning in 1992, some states started reporting 
Asian Indians and Koreans as separate race categories.7       To avoid a mismatch 
between the reported Asian race categories in NCHS from 1978 to 1991 on the one 
hand and after 1992 on the other hand, we combined Asian Indians, Koreans and 
Pacific Islanders into one category in the post-1992 data. This new post-1992 cat-
egory is equivalent to the category  “ other Asian or Pacific Islanders ”  in the 1978 
to 1991 data. 
 Our analysis thus considers two groups of newborn children: (1) Chinese and 
(2) other Asian or Pacific Islanders. We do not include Japanese or Filipinos in 
the latter category. A newborn baby is considered of a particular race only if both 
parents are of that race. 
 The NCHS data does not provide information on whether Asian parents were 
born in the United States or abroad. However, a rapid increase in Asian migration 
to the United States during the 1980s ( Lee 1998 ;  Kandel 2011 ) implies that a major-
ity of the newborn Chinese and other Asian or Pacific Islander children in our data 
were likely to have foreign-born parents.8       This is important for our analysis, as prior 
studies that have shown male-biased sex ratios at birth focused on foreign-born 
Asian immigrants ( Almond and Edlund 2008 ;  Abrevaya 2009 ;  Egan et al. 2011 ). 
 We compile the 1979 to 1994 NCHS data into two different datasets for our 
analysis. The first dataset contains a total of 6,142,600 childbirths during 1978 
to 1989 in Illinois and its neighboring states (i.e., 6 years before and 6 years after 
Illinois banned sex-selective abortion in 1984). Of these newborn children, 6296 
were Chinese and 42,472 were other Asian or Pacific Islanders. The second dataset 
contains data on 9,010,467 newborn children during 1983 to 1994 in Pennsylvania 
  6   The other race categories were White, Black, American Indian (includes Aleuts and Eskimos), 
Hawaiian (includes Part-Hawaiian), and other nonWhite. NCHS uses the term  “ race ”  to classify 
all these population groups. For simplicity, we also use their definition.  
  7   Also reported separately were Samoan, Vietnamese, and Guamanian.  
  8   The Asian population in the US grew by 70% in the 1980s between 1980 and 1988 ( Hollmann 
1990 ). More than 65% of the US Asian population (including children) was foreign-born in 1990, 
and the proportion increased to almost 70% in 2000 ( Lopez et al. 2013 ).

and its neighboring states (i.e., 6 years before and 6 years after Pennsylvania 
banned sex-selective abortion in 1989). Of these newborn children, 50,230 were 
Chinese and 116,068 were other Asian or Pacific Islanders. The raw estimates of 
the male-to-female sex ratios in these two datasets are presented in  Tables 3  and 
 4  in the Appendix.  
3    Methods 
3.1    Pooled Analysis 
 Using the above data, we first conduct a pooled regression analysis separately 
for the two state groups. The pooled model provides an overview of newborn sex 
ratios among the Asian races over the study periods in the two state groups. Our 
regression model is a state and year fixed linear probability model of the likelihood 
of a newborn child being male. It includes the following covariates: indicators of 
child ’ s ethnicity, live birth order, and father ’ s and mother ’ s education levels. We 
also separately run pooled regressions among children of 2nd or higher and 3rd 
or higher birth orders in both the Illinois and Pennsylvania state group samples.  
3.2    Difference-in-difference and Triple Difference Analysis 
 Next, in order to analyze the effect of the abortion ban on sex ratios, we construct 
a linear difference-in-difference regression model of the following form: 
Y =β +β ∗treat +β ∗post +β ∗treat ∗post +X γ+u (1)
     igt 0 1 g 2 t 3 g t igt igt   
 for the i  -th child in the g  -th state and time t  . Sex of the child (whether male) is 
denoted by Y. Binary variables t reat    and p  ost    denote the treatment status (i.e., 
 g   t 
whether the state is Illinois or Pennsylvania) and post-ban period (i.e., t     ≥   1984 for 
the IL analysis, and t     ≥   1989 for the PA analysis), respectively. The set of variables 
 X  includes father ’ s and mother ’ s education, and the live birth order of the child. 
 u     is the i id  error term of the model. The estimated coefficient  β      will show the 
 igt  2
differential effect of the ban on the gender of the children born in a treatment 
state, as compared with children from other states, and also in comparison with 
the pre-ban period. 
 Evidence from more recent data points towards slightly male-biased sex 
ratios at higher birth parities among certain Asian groups ( Almond and Edlund

2008 ;  Abrevaya 2009 ;  Egan et al. 2011 ). Therefore, it is important to further evalu-
ate the DID effect of the Illinois and Pennsylvania bans at higher birth parities 
in comparison with lower birth parities. To this end, we estimate a triple differ-
ence (difference-in-difference-in-difference) model by modifying equation (1) in 
the following way. First, we drop the live birth order variable from  X , and instead 
include a binary indicator of high birth parity for the i  -th child in the g  -th state 
and time t   as below: 
=1 if thelivebirthorderis≥3
High 
igt=0 if thelivebirthorderis1or2
     
 Then, we fully interact this high parity indicator with all other explanatory 
variables of the regression. The coefficient of the interaction term ( treat    ∗ p  ost    ∗ 
 g   t 
 high    ) in essence will estimate the triple difference (TD) effect, i.e., the differen-
 igt 
tial impact of the ban on higher birth parities (as compared with lower parities) in 
the treatment state as compared with the control state group. 
 Both the DID and TD regression models are estimated separately for Chinese 
and other Asian or Pacific Islander children. Standard errors are clustered at 
the state level and corrected using the wild bootstrap (1000 repetitions) method 
( Cameron et al. 2008 ).  
3.3    Robustness Checks, Matching, and Synthetic Controls 
 We test the robustness of our results in two different ways. First, we use two alter-
native econometric techniques to estimate the impact of the ban  –  the matching 
methods and synthetic control approach –    and compare them with the outcomes 
of the TD linear model. Second, we test the linear model with a series of placebo 
TD analyses. The results from our original TD models will be considered robust 
if they do not differ significantly from the outcomes of these additional analyses. 
These methods are described below. 
 There remains a possibility that newborn children in a state with the ban are 
systematically different in characteristics from those in the neighboring states. 
Such differences may bias the outcomes of the DID or the triple difference models. 
Propensity score matching methods ( Rosenbaum and Rubin 1983 ;  Heckman et al. 
1997 ;  Dehejia and Wahba 1998 ) can reduce such disparities between treatment 
and control observations by matching on the estimated propensity of the treat-
ment. We check the robustness of our results by using an alternative propensity 
score matching (PSM) methodology to evaluate the effect of the bans in Illinois 
and Pennsylvania. First, for all newborn children in the 1978 to 1983 pre-ban data,

we estimate the propensity score of the birth happening in Illinois as compared 
with the neighboring states (with X    as covariates). Then, Illinois newborns are 
matched with similar newborns in neighboring states on the basis of the esti-
mated propensity score. The average difference in the probability of being male 
between the matched Illinois and neighboring state observations will therefore 
be the average treatment effect on the treated ( ATT    ) in the pre-ban period. We 
 pre 
estimate a similar A  TT     between propensity-score-matched Illinois and neigh-
 post 
bor state observations in the post-ban 1984 to 1989 data. The difference (A  TT      –
 post 
 ATT    ) is the DID PSM effect of the ban in Illinois. Similarly, we also estimate the 
 pre 
DID PSM effect of the ban in PA, (  ATTPA −ATTPA), using data from 1983 to 1994.9       
post pre
 Furthermore, we check the robustness of our results by using the generalized 
DID methodology of synthetic controls ( Abadie and Gardeazabal 2003 ). In this 
analysis, the outcomes of a treatment state are not compared with the outcomes 
in neighboring states, but with a single “ s ynthetic”   control state. The control state 
is a convex combination of other states, such that its characteristics are similar 
to the treatment state. In order to construct the synthetic control, we include 
48 other states and Washington, D.C. in our analysis. The analysis for Illinois 
excludes Pennsylvania from the comparison states, and the analysis of Penn-
sylvania excludes Illinois. We create balanced state-year panel datasets with the 
mean values of the outcome and  X  variables. Two separate datasets are created: 
one over 1978 to 1989 for Illinois and all other states (except Pennsylvania), and 
another over 1983 to 1994 for Pennsylvania and all other states (except Illinois). 
We then report the DID effect of the ban in a treatment state in comparison with 
its synthetic control created in the data. For simplicity, we do not separately 
conduct the TD exercise (for higher parities) with this method.1  0     
 Finally, we run a series of placebo TD linear regression models. This is 
required to evaluate possible confounding factors that may bias our results, 
e.g., other public policies that may have coincided with the implementation of 
the ban. Our placebo models consider hypothetical scenarios where instead of 
year 1984 in Illinois and 1989 in Pennsylvania, the bans are assumed to be imple-
mented in a different year. We consider four placebo years of ban implementation 
for each state group  –  years 1982, 1983, 1985 and 1986 for Illinois, and years 1987, 
1988, 1990 and 1991 for Pennsylvania. Triple difference regressions separately for 
  9   We use a 5-nearest-neighbor matching (with replacement) method. Standard errors are bias-
corrected ( Abadie and Imbens 2006 ). For simplicity, we do not conduct TD analysis (for higher 
parities) using PSM.  
  10   We use the Stata programs s ynth.ado  for the synthetic control analysis, p smatch2.ado  for the 
PSM analysis, and c gmwildboot.ado  for the linear models.

Chinese and other Asian or Pacific Islander children are then run under each of 
these scenarios. For example, we consider a scenario in which the sex-selective 
abortion ban is implemented in Illinois in 1982. Then, the period 1978 – 1981 in 
our data is considered to be the pre-ban period, and 1982 – 1989 is considered 
post-ban. The outcomes in Illinois are evaluated between the post- and pre-ban 
periods, and also in comparison with the neighboring states. 
 To account for the fact that NCHS data includes both foreign-born and US-born 
Asian parents, we conduct further tests to ensure our analysis has enough statisti-
cal power to detect a small change in sex ratios at birth. Because the U.S. census 
indicates that as many as 70% of the Asians are foreign-born, our test assumes 
that only 70% of the Chinese and other Asian or Pacific Islander newborn chil-
dren in our analysis had foreign-born parents (see footnote 8). Therefore, we con-
sider samples sizes in Illinois, Pennsylvania and their neighboring state groups 
that are 30% smaller than those mentioned in Appendix  Table 5 . Then, we test 
whether this smaller sample will produce enough statistical power for a predeter-
mined effect size for the law. 
 Since there is no current benchmark effect size for sex-selective abortion 
bans in the United States or a similar socioeconomic context,  11     we simulate abso-
lute effect sizes (reduction in the probability of a newborn child being male) in 
the range of 0 to 0.1, with 0.001 increments. In order to avoid complexities related 
to a small number of clusters in our data, we consider a simple calculation of 
statistical power without clustering the standard errors within states. The statis-
tical power estimates from the simulations (with a 5% level of significance) are 
presented in Appendix  Figures 1  and  2 . 
 We find that with a power of 0.8 the 70% samples in Illinois and its neigh-
boring states are adequate for detecting changes in the probability of a boy birth 
among Chinese and other Asian or Pacific Islander children that are as small 
as 0.028 and 0.011, respectively. Similarly, the smallest effect sizes that can be 
detected by the 70% samples with a 0.8 power in Pennsylvania and its neighbor-
ing states are 0.028 and 0.012 among Chinese and other Asian or Pacific Islander 
newborn children, respectively. These effect sizes are similar to, or lower than, 
our estimates shown in  Table 2 . Also, the impact of the bans on sex-selective abor-
tion in Illinois and Pennsylvania among children of foreign-born parents, if any, 
are likely to be higher than the effects seen in the overall sample, which includes 
  11   A recent study by  Nandi and Deolalikar 2013  present some possible effect sizes of a ban on 
pre-natal sex determination in India. However, the socioeconomic and cultural context of this 
study, along with the nature of the law and its enforcement are completely different from our 
present study. Therefore, it does not provide a comparable benchmark.

both foreign-born and U.S.-born parents. Furthermore, any estimated effect size 
that is below the threshold minimum effect size produced by our sample will be of 
little importance, even if it is statistically significant ( Ziliak and McCloskey 2007 ).   
4    Results 
 First, we present some trend analysis using annual NCHS data in  Figures 3  and  4  in 
the Appendix. We analyze sex ratios among newborn Chinese and other Asian or 
Pacific Islander children to evaluate the so-called  “ parallel trends assumption, ”  
i.e., similar trends in the treatment and control states leading to the implementa-
tion of the sex-selective abortion ban. In addition, if the ban has any discernable 
impact, we should also observe a break in the trend for the treatment state from 
the pre-ban to the post-ban period. Since annual data on sex ratios at birth suffer 
from a large variance, we present a smoother 3-year moving average of sex ratios 
over time. We use data from an extended period during 1979 to 1999. It should 
be noted that during this period (in 1993) the law prohibiting sex-selective abor-
tion in Illinois was declared partially unenforceable by a federal court.1  2     Crimi-
nal sanctions were no longer allowed under the law for pre-viability abortions. 
However, civil penalties (such as fines) continue to be available for pre-viability 
sex-selective abortions and both criminal and civil penalties are available for 
post-viability abortions under the law. 
 We find that the parallel trends assumption is generally satisfied. We also 
find no significant changes in the trend of sex ratios at birth in Illinois or Pennsyl-
vania after the bans on sex-selective abortion were enacted. However, the trend 
lines of the Chinese newborn sex ratios are less conclusive because of fluctua-
tions in the data due to small sample sizes.1  3     
 Next, results from our pooled linear probability regression models of the 
odds-ratio of a boy birth are presented in  Table 1  . From the regression of Illinois 
and its neighboring states during 1979 to 1989, we find that Chinese and other 
Asian or Pacific Islander children are no more statistically likely to be male as 
compared with children of other races, controlling for parental education, live 
birth order of the child, and state and year fixed-effects. The results are similar

 However, from the same analysis of Pennsylvania and its neighboring states 
during 1984 to 1994, we find that Chinese and other Asian or Pacific Islander chil-
dren are slightly more likely to be male as compared to children of parents of 
other races, controlling for the covariates. The likelihood of male birth in these 
race groups increases with parity: among children of the 3rd or higher birth order, 
Chinese and other Asian or Pacific Islander children are 2% and 1.6% more likely 
to be male, respectively. However, the sample sizes of higher birth order Chinese 
children are generally low in our study and the results could be distorted as a 
result. 
 Results from the TD linear regression, PSM method and synthetic control 
analysis are presented in  Table 2 .  For a concise presentation, we only show the 
main DID parameter of interest  –  change in the probability of a boy birth in the 
treatment state (i.e., Illinois or Pennsylvania) from the pre-ban to the post-ban 
period, as compared with the change over the same period of time among its 
neighboring control states without abortion bans. In addition, the TD parameter 
(impact of the law among children of 3rd or higher birth parities) is also shown 
in the case of linear models. The outcomes of the synthetic control analysis are

   Data are from NCHS 1978 – 1989 for Illinois and its neighboring states, and 1983 – 1994 for 
Pennsylvania and its neighboring states. Estimators that are significant at 10% and 5% levels 
are respectively marked by * and **. In the synthetic control analysis, all 50 states and District 
of Columbia are included (except Illinois is excluded from Pennsylvania analysis, and Pennsyl-
vania is excluded from Illinois analysis). However, a few states are dropped (missing values of 
state-year) in order to create a balanced panel required for the synthetic control analysis. The 
propensity score matching method uses 5-nearest-neighbor matching with replacement, and 
the standard errors are bias corrected ( Abadie and Imbens 2006 ). Standard errors of the linear 
models are corrected using the wild bootstrap method ( Cameron et al. 2008 ), 1000 repetitions 
with null imposed. TD  =  triple difference; DID  =  difference-in-difference; PSM  =  propensity score 
matching.

shown as trend graphs in  Figures 5  and  6  in the Appendix. More detailed results 
are available from the authors on request. 
 The DID estimates from all three econometric methods are statistically insig-
nificant at the 10% level or lower. This indicates that bans on sex-selective abor-
tion in Illinois and Pennsylvania were not associated with any changes in sex 
ratios at birth of Chinese and other Asian or Pacific Islander children from the 
pre-ban to the post-ban periods. The TD regression coefficient for higher birth 
parities is also insignificant in all cases, indicating that the ban did not have any 
further effect on children of higher birth parities. 
 Results from placebo TD linear regressions are presented in  Table 6  in the 
Appendix. We find that the hypothetical bans on sex-selective abortion in these 
additional years are also not associated with any changes in the sex ratios at birth 
among Chinese and other Asian or Pacific Islander children from the pre-ban to 
the post-ban periods. The TD coefficients are also generally insignificant, showing 
no additional effect of the ban among children at higher birth parities.1  4     
 In sum, our findings indicate that sex-selective abortion bans in Illinois and 
Pennsylvania are not associated with any significant changes in sex ratios at birth 
of Chinese and other Asian or Pacific Islander children in the two states.  
5    Discussion and Conclusion 
 Since  Almond and Edlund (2008)  published a study finding male-biased sex 
ratios at higher birth parities among the children of foreign-born Chinese, 
Indian and Korean parents, six states have banned sex-selective abortion and 
21 states and U.S. Congress have considered similar bans. Prior to our study, 
no other empirical analysis has been conducted to determine whether laws 
banning sex-selective abortion impact sex ratios at birth. We used annual birth 
data from the National Center for Health Statistics from 1978 to 1994 to deter-
mine if legal prohibitions on sex-selective abortion enacted in Illinois in 1984 
and Pennsylvania in 1989 were associated with any changes in sex ratios at 
birth among Asians in those states. 
 Even though NCHS data does not distinguish between births of foreign-born 
and U.S.-born Asians, our results remain highly relevant to policy debates in the 
United States given that many believe both foreign-born and U.S.-born Asians 
  14   In a few cases, the DID or TD coefficients are marginally significant at 10% level. However, 
the magnitude of these effects are very small. Also, since there is no definite patterns, these idi-
osyncratic results are very likely due to small sample sizes.

sex select against girls. For example, the federal Prenatal Nondiscrimination 
Act (PRENDA) (H.R. 3541) that would ban sex-selective abortion throughout the 
United States claims:  “ The evidence strongly suggests that some Americans are 
exercising sex-selection abortion practices within the US consistent with discrim-
inatory practices common to… the country to which they trace their ancestry. ”1   5     
 We find that legal prohibitions on sex-selective abortion enacted in Illinois 
and Pennsylvania are not associated with any changes in sex ratios at birth 
among Asians in the 6-year period after the bans were enacted in each state. In 
Illinois and its neighboring states, the sex ratio at birth of Asian children was 
not male-biased during our study period. On the other hand, while the sex ratio 
at birth among Asians in Pennsylvania and its neighboring states was skewed 
slightly in favor of boys, the enactment of the ban did not normalize the ratio. 
This strongly suggests that sex-selective abortion bans have had no impact on the 
practice of sex selection, to the extent that it occurred, during the study period in 
the two states. 
 There may be several reasons why sex-selective abortion bans are not asso-
ciated with changes in sex ratios at birth. The bans only prohibit sex selection 
through abortion; there are no prohibitions on the use of pre-implantation repro-
ductive technologies, such as sperm sorting and genetic diagnosis, for the pur-
poses of sex selection. As a result, people may be using these techniques to sex 
select. The bans may also be hard to enforce due to the difficulty in determining a 
woman ’ s reason for seeking an abortion.
