Advancing Faculty Diversity 
Through Self-Directed Mentoring 
 
BY YVONNE M. DUTTON, MARGARET RYZNAR, AND LEA SHAVER* 
Abstract 
Mentoring is widely acknowledged to be important in career success, yet may 
be lacking for female and minority law professors, contributing to disparities in 
retention and promotion of diverse faculty. This Article presents the results of a 
unique diversity mentoring program conducted at one law school. Mentoring is 
often thought of as something directed by the mentor on behalf of the protégé. Our 
framework  inverts  that  model,  empowering  diverse  faculty  members  to 
proactively  cultivate  their  own  networks  of  research  mentors.  The  studied 
intervention  consisted  of  modest  programming  on  mentorship,  along  with 
supplemental travel funds to focus specifically on travel for the purpose of 
cultivating mentors beyond one’s own institution. Participants were responsible 
for setting their own mentorship goals, approaching mentors and arranging 
meetings,  and  reporting  annually  on  their  activities  and  progress.  Both 
quantitative and qualitative evidence demonstrate that the program has been 
effective along its measurable goals in its first year. Participants report growing 
their networks of mentors, receiving significant advice on research and the tenure 
process, and being sponsored for new opportunities. The authors conclude that 
this type of mentoring initiative, if more broadly applied, could have a significant 
impact on reducing disparities in retention and promotion in the legal academy. 
To facilitate such replication, the Article describes both the process of designing 
the program and the actual operation of the program as carried out at one school. 
In sum, the Article offers a concrete starting point for discussions at any law school 
interested in advancing faculty diversity through improved mentoring.

INTRODUCTION 
For  decades,  there  have  been  calls  for  law  schools  to  increase  faculty 
diversity, particularly among the schools’ tenured and leadership ranks.1 The 
institutional benefits of faculty diversity for law schools—in both teaching and 
scholarship—are  well  documented.2  Research  in  the  corporate  context  also

  2.   See, e.g., Johnson, One Dean’s Perspective, supra note 1, at 1557–1563 (summarizing the benefits 
of faculty diversity to legal scholarship and teaching). A diverse faculty can help minority and female 
students feel more comfortable in the law school environment and offer them role models they can 
emulate. See Meera E. Deo, Maria Woodruff, & Rican Vue, Paint by Number? How the Race and Gender of 
Law School Faculty Affect the First-Year Curriculum, 29 CHICANO-LATINO L. REV. 1, 9–10 (2010) 
(referencing studies concluding that the absence of a diverse faculty can lead to feelings of isolation 
among female students and students of color). See also Johnson, One Dean’s Perspective, supra note 1, at 
1557 (“[L]aw students want and need role models. This is especially the case for women and minority 
students, two groups that historically have been systematically excluded from law schools and the legal 
profession in the United States.”). But see Anita L. Allen, On Being a Role Model, 6 BERKELEY WOMEN’S 
L. J. 22 (1990-91) (arguing that while diverse faculty have an important role to play in educating diverse 
students as “templates, symbols, and nurturers,” overemphasizing “the role model argument” may 
reflect or reinforce biases by suggesting that diverse candidates do not deserve to be hired on the basis 
of their scholarly qualifications, by encouraging heightened expectations or requirements of diverse 
faculty, or by subtly undervaluing the other contributions and qualifications of excellent candidates 
who happen to be diverse). Faculty diversity also helps to instill an appreciation for diversity in the 
next generation of lawyers and leaders. See Carson, supra note 1, at 4–6 (noting the benefits African-
American faculty members can have on law schools and society writ large); Deo, Woodruff, & Vue, 
supra at 36–37 (showing that women faculty and faculty of color are more likely to engage in diversity 
discussions in the classroom). Additionally, studies have shown that exposing students to women 
faculty and faculty of color breaks down stereotypical gender beliefs and prejudiced attitudes. Chris Dutton et. al MACRO FINAL (Do Not Delete)  1/10/2018  6:57 PM

supports the benefits of diversity to organizations, showing that “[d]iverse teams 
and companies produce better results and higher revenue and profit.”3 Indeed, the 
bylaws of the American Association of Law Schools (AALS) identify diversity—
along with academic freedom and excellence in teaching and research—as a core 
value.4  The  AALS  bylaws  require  member  schools  to  demonstrate  their 
commitment to a diverse faculty,5 and the outgoing and incoming presidents of 
AALS have just launched a two-year focus on diversity.6 
A recent law review article argues that the diversifying task is done:7 “Now 
that the important work of race and gender integration has succeeded on law 
school faculties—with the traditional affirmative action groups now matching or 
exceeding their percentages in the broader lawyer population—the next step 
should be to desegregate law schools politically.”8 We are less convinced that law 
schools should be content with racial and gender underrepresentation that mirrors 
the underrepresentation in the broader legal profession. Achieving true parity in 
all  faculty  ranks  remains  important  to  transforming  law  schools  into  truly 
inclusive and egalitarian communities.9

  9.   Additionally, achieving a degree of diversity that reflects American society as a whole is 
important so that female and minority faculty are not viewed as tokens. Goodman & Redfield, supra

is then also magnified—making the student feel like a member of the “out group.” Id. at 125–26. 
Underrepresentation  of  women  and  minorities  also  results  in  these  groups  performing  a 
disproportionate share of service work. See, e.g., Devon W. Carbado & Mitu Gulati, Tenure, 53 J. LEGAL

Although progress has been made over time,10 law schools still have a 
substantial distance to travel. The United States population is 51% female and 38% 
minority.11 Representation of women and minority faculty comes closest to these 
figures at the entry level, but falls off higher up the faculty ladder. Women 
comprise 48% of tenure-track law faculty, but only 33% of tenured faculty, and 
29% of law school deans.12 Ethnic minorities comprise 30% of tenure-track law 
faculty, but only 17% of tenured faculty and 21% of law school deans.13 A similar 
“pyramid problem” pattern prevails in academia generally.14 
Unfortunately,  it  cannot  be  assumed  that  the  upper-level  figures  will 
eventually “catch up” to the entry-level rates. A statistical analysis of 324 tenure-
track law faculty hired in 1996-97 found significant gender and ethnic disparities 
in the rates at which new hires persisted in academia and achieved tenure: 77% for 
non-minority men, 65% for non-minority women, 52% for minority women, and 
42% for minority men.15 Law schools are still not hiring diverse faculty members

in sufficient numbers to achieve parity, and the hiring gap is worsened by 
significant inequalities in promotion and tenure. 
Improving  faculty  diversity  may  be  more  challenging  in  the  current 
environment due to declining rates of student enrollment and faculty hiring 
freezes at many schools.16 However, this context makes it more important than 
ever to retain, develop, and promote diverse faculty. Yet, hiring diverse faculty 
members does not necessarily ensure that they are retained and promoted,17 and 
studies  recognize  that  early-career  mentoring  helps  improve  the  odds  of 
retention.18  Making  additional  investments  in  already-hired  law  faculty  also 
represents a particularly cost-effective diversity strategy. 
This Article not only argues that law schools should make more systematic 
use of early career mentoring to promote faculty diversity, but also offers a cost-
effective, replicable model for doing so. Importantly, the mentoring program 
described here was designed by and for diverse early-career faculty, informed by 
the scientific literature on mentoring and adapted to the specific context of legal 
academia. 
Most mentoring programs within law schools follow a standard model that 
assigns a protégé to one or more designated mentors within the school. Our 
program flips that model on its head, providing diverse early-career faculty 
members with training and resources to cultivate their own team of informal 
mentors. This reflects a finding within the mentoring literature that informal 
mentorship may be more effective than formal mentorship. A second unique 
feature of our mentorship program is the incorporation of both quantitative and 
qualitative  techniques  to evaluate  its effectiveness.  This  Article  presents  the 
resulting  data,  allowing  readers  to  judge  for  themselves  the  program’s 
effectiveness, and providing insight into how and why mentorship can improve 
faculty outcomes. 
Part I introduces the relevance of mentoring for enhancing faculty diversity. 
Part II draws upon the literature on mentoring within law faculties more broadly 
and explains the special concerns of early-career legal scholars that informed the 
program design. Part III describes the program model in sufficient detail to allow 
for its replication, including the evaluation methods. Part IV presents the results 
after  the  program’s  first  year,  drawing  on  both  quantitative  measures  and 
participant narratives. Part V reflects on the potential for programs like this to 
contribute to broader change in the legal academy. For readers who would like to 
replicate or adapt this program at their own law schools, sample assessment forms 
are provided as appendices, as well as the grant proposal.

I. MENTORING IN THE LEGAL ACADEMY 
The  benefits  of  professional  mentoring  are  numerous. Mentors  provide 
protégés with both career and psychosocial support.19 According to an analysis of 
empirical  literature,  individuals  who  have  been  mentored  report  higher 
compensation, more promotions, greater career satisfaction, commitment, and 
optimism that they will advance further.20 For academics, professional mentoring 
has importance not only in the gatekeeping stages of landing the first job and 
surviving tenure review, but also in the ongoing process of pursuing excellence as 
a scholar and colleague, negotiating lateral moves, and advancing to a chaired 
position or deanship. 
The literature on mentoring draws a distinction between formal and informal 
mentoring. “Formal” mentoring is more artificially structured and takes place in a 
setting where the mentor and mentee explicitly agree to undertake a mentoring 
relationship with specific goals and boundaries. 
Mentoring can also take place informally, without an explicit agreement. A 
senior faculty member provides informal mentoring when she takes an interest in 
a young scholar, encourages her, offers feedback on her scholarship, provides her 
with professional opportunities, or makes introductions to others in the field. 
When a junior faculty member approaches a respected colleague to seek advice or 
assistance, she is initiating informal mentoring. 
Informal mentoring remains the predominant mode in which junior faculty 
members are socialized to the expectations and methods of legal research and 
collegiality. In a 2009 study, only 23% of law faculty reported receiving formal 
mentoring, while 75% reported receiving informal mentoring. This might seem to 
call for greater emphasis on expanding formal mentoring. However, law faculty 
protégés are substantially more likely to characterize the mentoring they received 
as effective when it was informal (81%) rather than formal (56%).21 This mirrors a 
broader trend documented in the mentoring literature: mentees receiving informal 
mentoring report better satisfaction and outcomes than those receiving formal 
mentoring.22  Fortunately,  these  two  forms  of  mentoring  are  not  mutually 
exclusive, and a combination of formal and informal mentoring approaches is 
likely to be most effective.23

  ADVANCING FACULTY DIVERSITY  61 
Unfortunately,  diverse  faculty  are  at  a  disadvantage  when  it  comes  to 
mentoring.  Studies  show  that  women  and  minorities  are  less  likely  than 
individuals in majority groups to spontaneously develop informal mentoring 
relationships.24 According to Haynes, “[an] injurious consequence of the lack of 
formal mentoring programs is the likelihood that women and people of color [are] 
intentionally  or  unintentionally  excluded  from  these  informal  mentoring 
relationships  because  they  are  demographically  different  from  law  faculty 
mentors.”25  Formal  mentoring  programs—whether  open  to  everyone  or 
specifically  targeted  at  underrepresented  groups—have  been  identified  as 
important to achieving diversity goals in a broad range of contexts.26 While formal 
mentoring programs have the advantage that diverse faculty are more likely to 
participate in them, the data suggest that informal mentoring may be more 
effective.27 Thus, a key challenge in the design of mentoring initiatives for diverse 
faculty is how to leverage the strengths of both formal and informal mentoring. 
The legal academy also presents unique challenges for ensuring that early-
career faculty are adequately mentored as scholars. Because law faculty members 
are generally not required to complete a PhD program,28 they do not have the 
advantage of the scholarly mentoring foundation that such programs provide. 
Many law schools discourage co-authorship prior to tenure,29 depriving junior law 
faculty  of  yet  another  prime  opportunity  for  informal  mentoring.  Law 
departments also tend to seek a diversity of research interests in hiring, in order 
to offer the broadest variety of courses and expert faculty to students. For this 
reason, research collaborations in the law most commonly take place between 
faculty from two or more different law schools. Even if scholarly mentoring is 
possible within the law school, it may create conflicts of interest at the time of the 
tenure vote.30 Thus, the organic opportunities for mentoring through research 
collaboration that would be found within many other university departments tend 
to be lacking in the law.

suggesting that women and minorities face “significant barriers in developing informal workplace 
mentoring relationships”); id. at 558–59 (summarizing literature on the “cloning” phenomenon in 
academic and business settings, whereby informal mentors disproportionately cultivate protégés who 
remind them of themselves).

To realize these opportunities, pre-tenure law faculty must actively engage 
research mentors and collaborators within their fields. The standard law school 
mentoring program—matching a junior faculty member with a senior member of 
the same faculty—generally does not achieve this. It is crucial that legal scholars 
develop  mentors  “beyond  the  building”—at  other  law  schools,  in  other 
departments, or in related fields of practice. 
Additionally, the new mentoring paradigm in the literature is not focused on 
having just one mentor, but rather a network of mentors that complement each 
other and fulfill different functions.31 “The notion of a single experienced faculty 
member being able to play the all-inclusive role of mentor to a protégé is probably 
wishful thinking.”32 Alternative models—including peer mentoring, collective 
mentoring, and multiple mentoring—have a particularly important role to play in 
supporting diverse early-career faculty.33 We consider the multiple mentoring 
model—in which the mentee takes the initiative to cultivate a network of mentors 
fulfilling different needs—particularly appropriate for early-career legal scholars. 
Some early-career faculty members may be at a disadvantage in developing 
these networks of mentors because of their more isolated geographical location or 
more limited institutional resources. Scholars in coastal corridors can travel at little 
expense to nearby law schools to present research, network with colleagues, and 
cultivate mentors and collaborators. Scholars based in other parts of the country 
typically require a flight and hotel to realize the same benefit. As a legal scholar 
rises in reputation, she will receive more and more invitations on an expense-paid 
basis. But in the early-career stage, when it is most important to establish a 
network of mentors, law faculty are more likely to be dependent on their own 
institution’s funding. 
In sum, professional mentoring—particularly around research—is important 
to  faculty  retention  and  advancement.  Relying  on  spontaneous  mentoring, 
however,  tends  to  disadvantage  diverse  faculty.  The  introduction  of  formal 
mentoring  programs  pairing  junior  and  senior  faculty  members  within  an 
institution represents an improvement, but also has limits. The literature suggests 
that junior faculty members will realize the greatest benefit from having a network 
of informal mentors. Because of the unique characteristics of legal scholarship, 
mentoring around research, in particular, requires reaching beyond one’s own 
institution. Depending on the geographic location of a particular school, this may 
require allocating financial resources for junior faculty members to travel to where 
their potential mentors are located.

II.  DESIGNING A REPLICABLE MODEL 
The impetus for developing this mentoring program at Indiana University 
Robert H. McKinney School of Law was a campus-wide initiative by the Office for 
Academic  Affairs.34  The  campus  initiative  offered  matching  funding  for 
departments proposing significant new mentoring programs to support faculty 
retention and promotion. Departments were strongly encouraged to focus their 
proposed initiatives on populations that would help to advance the diversity goals 
of the campus. Since our junior faculty at the time happened to comprise six 
women, including one woman of color, it was natural to take the junior faculty as 
our focus.35 In proposing the program and securing institutional buy-in, we 
emphasized  the  benefits  for  faculty  diversity,  as  well  as  broader  goals  of 
promoting  research  excellence  and  faculty  retention.  We  noted  that  if  our 
proposed program achieved its goals and all faculty members participating in the 
mentoring program were retained and tenured, the law school’s tenured faculty 
would go from 30% female to nearly 40% female.36 The proposal was ultimately 
approved and fully funded, under the name Mentoring Untenured Scholars for 
Clinical and Legal Excellence (MUSCLE). 
In designing the program, we began by speaking informally to both junior 
and senior law school faculty to identify challenges related to mentoring on our 
campus. We found that our junior faculty were very satisfied with the mentorship 
available to them in the areas of teaching and institutional citizenship. Because of 
the universal nature of these responsibilities, this type of mentoring is easy to find 
within the law school. Senior colleagues at our school tend to be very generous 
with their time when questions or issues arise in these areas. Student evaluation 
data also bore out that there was little to no need for support in the field of 
teaching,  as  this  population  was  already  performing  above  the  institutional 
average in the classroom.37 It was during this process, however, that we identified 
the specific need for research mentorship. Both junior and senior faculty at IU 
McKinney  noted  research-focused  mentoring  as  the  top  priority.  Like  most 
American law schools, ours has a strong expectation that non-clinical faculty 
should go up for tenure and promotion based on excellence in research. The law 
school’s pre-tenure research faculty members also have a strong motivation to 
achieve this excellence, not merely for the purposes of tenure and promotion, but 
also for the more fundamental purposes of advancing their research agendas,

  35.   No deliberate law school policy required hiring this female faculty. The reason that it 
“happened” to be all female is that the last male tenure-track faculty member had been tenured, recent 
male faculty hires were more senior laterals, and one junior male professor departed the faculty for 
another institution. Three of the six MUSCLE participants are authors of this paper. 
  36.   Several female faculty had retired in recent years, decreasing the tenured female faculty to 
30%.

contributing to the profession and society as a whole, and fully enjoying their 
calling as scholars. 
Because of factors specific to the structure of legal research,38 we came to 
believe that it was particularly important for research mentoring to involve a 
network of mentors and collaborators “beyond the building.” Because of our 
Midwestern  location,  building  these  relationships  requires  significant  travel. 
Although our institution provides all faculty with a moderate travel budget, there 
is currently no ability to seek additional travel funds from the dean based on 
special needs or opportunities. Early-career faculty noted that they are particularly 
dependent on institutional funding because they have not yet built the reputations 
and  networks  that  lead  to  paid  invitations.  Yet  early-career  faculty  at  our 
institution did not enjoy any priority in the allocation of institutional travel funds. 
We therefore identified enhanced travel funding as a critical component of the 
program.  Based  on  the  Office  of  Academic  Affairs  budget  guidelines, 
departmental matching requirements, and the number of faculty members in our 
target population, we arrived at the figure of $1,500 of travel funds per person per 
year necessary to accomplish the goals of the program. Participants were told they 
could use these funds for travel to a conference with a significant mentorship 
component, or for a trip specifically focused on networking and mentoring 
unrelated to a conference. 
If additional travel funding was the “dough” of our new mentoring initiative, 
the “yeast” was brief programming to sensitize participants to the importance of 
mentoring for their academic careers. The mentoring literature suggested that 
informal mentoring relationships may be most effective. We therefore devised a 
hybrid  program  with  few  formal  aspects,  which  emphasized  the  need  for 
participants to proactively activate and develop an informal mentoring network 
of  their  own  that  was  consistent  with  the  “multiple  mentoring”  model. 
Accordingly, participants attended a single hour-long discussion session, which 
focused on the “why and how” of developing their own network of informal 
mentors. Participants were encouraged to share their experiences with one another 
during the program, and were expected to write a brief self-evaluation memo at 
the end of the year. Ultimately, each participant spent many hours engaged in 
mentoring interactions, but these experiences were structured by the participants 
themselves, not by the program. 
Perhaps the most important features of our program were the assessment 
components.  Two  different  instruments  were  developed.  Each  participant 
prepared a short narrative self-report memo describing her participation in the 
program and what she accomplished. The self-reporting memos held participating 
faculty members accountable for setting their own mentoring goals, making 
mentorship development a priority, designing travel with mentorship in mind, 
and reflecting on their progress toward their mentorship goals. These were shared 
with law school leadership and among the participants. This had the benefit of 
further reinforcing the message about the importance of mentorship, and sharing 
strategies of how to most effectively use the funds. Participants also anonymously 
completed a survey that assessed their perceptions (on a one- to five-point scale) 
regarding measurable goals of the program. The quantitative instrument was 
 
  38.   See id. at 5-6 (discussing “Methodology of Intervention”). Dutton et. al MACRO FINAL (Do Not Delete)  1/10/2018  6:57 PM 
  ADVANCING FACULTY DIVERSITY  65 
administered at the program’s beginning and at the end of its first year, permitting 
comparisons across time. Both the quantitative and qualitative assessments were 
designed to evaluate the program’s effectiveness, identify avenues for year-on-
year improvement, and provide evidence to make a case for continuing the 
program  beyond  the  initial  grant  term.  We  reproduce  these  assessment 
instruments in the appendices. 
III. RESULTS AFTER THE FIRST YEAR 
To  objectively  assess  the  program’s success in achieving its  goals,  two 
different measurement instruments were used. Both assessments suggest the 
program was successful in advancing mentoring of the participating faculty 
members. 
A.  Quantitative Assessment Tool 
The data obtained from the (anonymous) quantitative instrument reveal 
positive progress toward all of the program’s measurable goals, with many 
measures improving dramatically. Participants were asked to score on a five-point 
scale their responses to thirteen questions regarding measurable goals at the 
beginning of the MUSCLE program in 2015, and then again after the first year of 
the program in 2016. 
Four measures showed at least one full point improvement on a five-point 
scale. Compared to a year ago, participants now feel substantially better informed 
about the mentoring resources available to them at their law school and the 
broader university campus. Participants also express much greater confidence that 
they know how to effectively cultivate a network of mentors to help them achieve 
excellence in research, and that they have the necessary resources to do so. 
Participants  further  reported  substantially  stronger  relationships  with  their 
mentors after the intervention. These measures suggest that MUSCLE participants 
feel significantly more empowered to cultivate their own networks of research 
mentors—the core goal of the program. 
Several additional measures showed at least one-half point improvement on 
the five-point scale. Among these, MUSCLE participants increasingly report that 
they consider mentoring “very” important to their success as a legal scholar. They 
also report regarding research that they are more frequently in contact with 
mentors both within the law school and beyond. Participants additionally report 
that they feel more prepared and motivated to serve as a mentor to others. These 
measures all suggest an attitudinal shift: MUSCLE participants have become more 
sensitive to the value of mentoring, which has paid dividends not only “beyond 
the building,” but also within it. 
Two  measures  from  the  survey  instrument  showed  more  limited 
improvement, of less than one-half point on the five-point scale. Included in these 
measures, MUSCLE participants report that they are somewhat more satisfied 
with the research-related mentorship they receive from outside the law school. 
They are only slightly more satisfied with the current progress of their research 
agenda. These “satisfaction” measures show the smallest improvement, perhaps 
because the MUSCLE program has also led participants to raise their expectations 
even higher. Dutton et. al MACRO FINAL (Do Not Delete)  1/10/2018  6:57 PM

Satisfaction  is  improving,  the  value  placed  upon  mentoring  has  increased 
substantially, and participants’ sense of empowerment to cultivate mentors has 
seen the greatest increase. 
B.  Narrative Assessment Tool 
The individual narrative self-assessments reinforce the conclusion that the 
improvements in regard to cultivating mentors and the importance of mentoring 
are a direct result of MUSCLE. While we received responses identified by the  
 
 
 Dutton et. al MACRO FINAL (Do Not Delete)  1/10/2018  6:57 PM 
  ADVANCING FACULTY DIVERSITY  67 
resondent’s name, we reproduce selected anonymized comments to demonstrate 
five emerging themes.39 
1.  Different Methods of Incorporating Mentorship into Travel Plans 
Consistent with the program’s focus on empowering participants to identify 
and meet their own mentoring needs, participants reported using the travel 
funding in diverse ways. 
Most participants used at least part of the extra funding to attend conferences 
or workshops that they would ordinarily have had to skip. 
I used a substantial amount of the MUSCLE funding to attend the . . . [c]onference, which 
specifically targets [minority] law school faculty (although all are welcome) and aims to 
provide a supportive network across the academy. More importantly, the conference 
deliberately  works  to  facilitate  mentor-mentee  relationships  between  tenured  and 
untenured faculty members. 
With the funding, I was able to take two trips, each of which involved a significant 
mentoring component. Each of these trips has had significant follow-up effects for my work 
and career, and without the funding, I most likely would have had to choose between the 
trips. 
The workshop operated on a slim budget so participants had to fund their own airfare. But 
for MUSCLE, I would have declined the invitation. And I am so glad I went! Somewhat 
to my surprise, the workshop turned out to be an excellent opportunity for cultivating 
mentors. I was the most junior scholar in the room, in the company of four superstar 
scholars in my field. 
Other participants used their funds to conduct a trip focused on spending 
one-on-one time with mentors in their field, unconnected to a conference or 
workshop: 
Prior to the MUSCLE program, I did not have this luxury because I did not have the 
funding to take mentoring trips, yet it is so important—I now see—because it is quality 
one-on-one time that would not be possible in a more hectic context, such as a national 
conference.  Furthermore, taking a specific mentoring trip puts mentoring on the agenda 
as a priority, and it results in quality mentoring because of this prominence on the agenda. 
I appreciated having the additional funds to use for me, not just for presentation 
appearances. It was really nice to have several days to connect one-on-one with people that 
I really admire and respect. 
The remaining $200 was used for a one-night hotel stay [in a nearby state capital]. The 
primary purpose of the visit was to meet and engage with two very well-respected lobbyists 
who work with issues related to my research area. This was a fruitful visit both on the 
mentor front as well as the research sphere. They both gave me great advice about my 
research and suggested other avenues that I ought to explore. Their advice included not 
only suggestions concerning important additional legislation but also other helpful 
contacts. They explained to me the “politics” behind much of the legislation I was interested 
in, and also put me in touch with important bureaucrats. 
 
  39.   We received consent from MUSCLE participants and Institutional Review Board approval to 
use these narratives in any publications regarding the mentoring program. As part of the approval, we 
agreed to report them anonymously and to remove any identifying information. Dutton et. al MACRO FINAL (Do Not Delete)  1/10/2018  6:57 PM 
68 DUKE JOURNAL OF GENDER LAW & POLICY  Volume 25:55  2017 
Some trips combined both approaches: attending a conference and including 
an additional “mentoring day” with the extra funding. 
I had been invited to participate in a workshop at [one university], with my flight and 
related expenses paid by the host institution. I used about $250 of MUSCLE funds to cover 
a second night’s hotel stay and a rental car, in order to add on a half-day visit to [a nearby 
university]. 
I booked a ticket allowing me to arrive early so that I could spend half a day meeting with 
faculty. I had never met most of these people before. I just emailed them three weeks in 
advance to say I would be in town and could I visit their office to seek some career advice 
as a young legal scholar. Everyone said yes. 
Because the program gave protégées significant discretion over the use of 
their travel funds, each participant was able to put the resources to what she 
deemed the best use. 
2.  Mentoring on Research and Other Topics 
Of the six participants in our program, the five tenure-track faculty will go 
up for tenure in research and the clinical professor will go up for long-term 
contract status in teaching. All of the participants reported focusing mentorship 
conversations on their research or clinical program design, and receiving valuable 
advice in these areas. 
The narratives indicate that participants were able to obtain mentoring 
focused specifically on research, including advice on publishing a first book, 
reframing an article’s argument, new issues within a field that should receive 
attention, scholarly blogging, and more. Mentoring conversations also extended 
to related topics such as pitfalls to avoid in going up for tenure and general career 
advice. 
I used the bulk of the funding to attend a conference that attracts many scholars in my 
research area. It is also one that many junior scholars want to participate in because (1) it 
involves a competitive process for participation (double blind review of research abstracts) 
and (2) pairs participants with a discussant who is established in the same research field 
as the junior scholar. My discussant was an expert in my general area of research. She 
provided detailed comments on my paper and also gave me advice on avenues for 
publication. Indeed, she suggested that I could build on the draft article and propose a book 
project based on some of the ideas discussed in the draft. I also turned to her for additional 
comments on [a] grant application I submitted later. Another scholar in my area 
approached me after my presentation and has since provided me detailed comments on the 
draft article. I incorporated her fantastic comments. 
Professor [so-and-so], an expert in [my field] commented on my most recent article. Her 
comments were invaluable and significantly contributed to an important doctrinal change 
in my piece. I continue to receive correspondence from this professor. 
I reached out to friends as soon as I received [a nearby] invitation; they were able to put me 
on the schedule for a speaker series. I presented to an audience of about 30 law students 
and interdisciplinary scholars. I used the forum as an opportunity to broadly describe and 
reflect on the trajectory of my research during my path to tenure. During the discussion, I 
benefited from the perspectives and feedback of a diverse group of scholars. 
[Professor such-and-such] is not in my field, but he has published many academic books 
that also reach a general audience. I wanted to get his advice on my own book project. I was Dutton et. al MACRO FINAL (Do Not Delete)  1/10/2018  6:57 PM 
  ADVANCING FACULTY DIVERSITY  69 
surprised  to  learn  that  it  actually  is  now  acceptable  (and  common  practice)  to 
simultaneously send a book proposal to multiple university presses. He gave me great 
advice on how to identify presses worth applying to, and how to frame my proposal and 
enquiry email. [Another professor] gave me great substantive feedback on many angles of 
my book project, as well as advice about non-research activities (such as consulting) that 
would or would not be a good idea to take on after achieving tenure. 
I spent [several days] of my trip working with [two people in my field] and learning more 
about what they do, how they do it, and how we might be able to partner together in the 
future. 
The nature of these conversations ran the gamut from tenure to reading additional drafts 
of my paper to advice on drafting grants to the possibility of a research collaboration in the 
near future. 
I had many conversations with [a practitioner in my field] regarding my research . . . She 
also connected me to a number of conferences in my research area in [the region] and 
outside of the legal academy that I have found useful to understanding the practical effects 
of legislation and programming [in this field]. She is now someone I consider a mentor and 
she continues to advise me on my research. 
3.  New Opportunities as a Result of Mentoring Relationships 
Several  participants  reported  that  their  mentoring  outreach  resulted  in 
additional invitations or other professional opportunities, in addition to research 
and career advice. 
The additional MUSCLE funds caused me to think about reaching out to my senior 
colleagues to see if they could seek out some opportunities for me to present my work. 
Basically, I told a couple of senior colleagues that I had some funds that would allow me to 
pay to travel to another law school and give a talk, so that the other law school did not have 
to pay for me to visit. One of my colleagues made some calls and was successful in 
arranging for me to present. 
A scholar I met [on a funded trip] agreed to make efforts to reach out to her contacts so that 
I might interview them for my research. 
I garnered two conference invitations from mentoring conversations, each of which I 
accepted and each of which I am certain will lead to more relationships and scholarly 
development. 
Because I was involved in designing the MUSCLE program, I actually began cultivating 
my mentorship relationships more intentionally about a year ago. These efforts have 
already begun to pay off. I would estimate that as a direct result of more intentionally 
cultivating relationships with external mentors, I benefitted from at least $4000 in travel 
funding and $7500 in research support from other institutions. 
Because many of the seeds planted during mentorship travel may take time 
to grow, this early analysis likely underestimates the follow-on opportunities that 
will ultimately come about as a result of investments in mentorship. 
4.  An Attitudinal Shift: Appreciating and Prioritizing Mentorship 
Another theme that emerges from the narratives is that participants report a 
shift in attitudes toward mentoring. More than one participant reported that the 
very fact of having a program focused on mentoring encouraged prioritization of Dutton et. al MACRO FINAL (Do Not Delete)  1/10/2018  6:57 PM 
70 DUKE JOURNAL OF GENDER LAW & POLICY  Volume 25:55  2017 
it. The funding and reporting held participants accountable. The program also 
required participants to consciously focus on mentoring and to reflect on its 
impact. The reflection process itself emerges as a significant component of the 
intervention, sensitizing participants to their own power to advance their careers 
by proactively seeking out mentoring. 
The MUSCLE program support has made me really think about mentoring and made me 
feel that I have the additional resources to help me seek out opportunities to connect with 
senior scholars and other scholars in my field.  Seeking out mentors is not easy work. But, 
this funding essentially forces me to get out there and ask for advice and input. I am at the 
beginning stages of “seeking out mentors.” But, I feel that I am now on track. I am much 
more willing than I was before to reach out to people and ask for help and advice – and to 
ask them to read my work and comment on it. I hope to get even better next year at seeking 
out and building on my existing mentoring relationships. 
The MUSCLE program influenced the way I view mentoring as part of my professional 
development  by  virtue  of  allocating  funds  specifically  geared  toward  establishing 
mentoring relationship. This demonstrates a commitment by the University to mentoring 
as well as signals the importance of professional mentor relationships. I never thought 
about the importance of mentoring until the MUSCLE program. Prior to MUSCLE, I had 
two people that I consider mentors and I did not think to broaden my mentor circle until 
MUSCLE.  With the MUSCLE funds, I was very deliberate in choosing where to go and 
the mentor objectives to be achieved. I am happy to report back that my experiences were 
wonderful. I now have at least eight people that I consider mentors and feel free to consult 
with. 
MUSCLE opened my eyes to something that should have been obvious but was not: the 
importance of seeking out professional advice and tending to personal relationships. A year 
ago I would have said I had one mentor. Now, I would say there are several dozen people 
on my mentoring team. I have learned that cultivating mentoring relationships is actually 
quite emotionally fulfilling both for me and for my intended mentor, that it is surprisingly 
easy for me to do, and that people are actually very willing and happy to do it when they 
see that you appreciate it. I was surprised to see in my own life just how powerful the payoff 
of mentorship turned out to be. I feel this has had an enormous positive impact on my 
research and broader professional development. 
The MUSCLE program has made apparent to me how immediate and influential the effects 
of mentoring can be. I actually was not aware of the direct and significant career benefits I 
had received from the mentoring component of the conferences I attended until working on 
this self-assessment. 
The biggest impact that my participation in the MUSCLE program had was on the way I 
now approach mentoring—as worthy of a trip and time in itself. 
5.  Additional Themes 
The program did not require participants to commit to investing a minimum 
number of hours in mentorship conversations. Nor did the assessment techniques 
directly ask how much time participants actually spent in mentorship activities. 
The narratives, however, make clear that participants ultimately chose to spend 
many hours on these activities. An improvement in the assessment documents for 
the future would be to ask participants to estimate the number of hours they spent 
in certain categories of mentorship activities. 
 Dutton et. al MACRO FINAL (Do Not Delete)  1/10/2018  6:57 PM 
  ADVANCING FACULTY DIVERSITY  71 
Some participants also mentioned that they became more aware of their own 
role as potential mentors to scholars more junior than they are, and that they had 
invested additional time in these activities as a result of participation. Future 
iterations of assessment instruments might ask questions to specifically get at this 
dynamic, considering its potential benefits for the participants’ colleagues and 
students within their own institution. 
IV. CONCLUSION 
Recognizing diversity as a core value in legal education, law schools continue 
to pursue the elusive goal of faculty parity. Mentoring diverse faculty for retention 
and promotion represents an important strategy, particularly in times of slow 
hiring. Mentoring is widely acknowledged to be important in career advancement, 
yet can be lacking for female and minority professors, which can contribute to 
disparities in retention and advancement. Empowering early-career faculty to 
proactively cultivate research mentors should be recognized as an important 
strategy to achieve law schools’ diversity goals. 
The mentoring program described in this Article has been in place for only 
one year. The results described here are necessarily preliminary, and limited to 
one institution. Yet both the quantitative and qualitative data demonstrate positive 
effects.  Participants  report  taking  mentorship  more  seriously,  are  investing 
significant time in mentorship, express greater satisfaction in the mentoring 
available to them, and are receiving advice and opportunities that they consider 
to be valuable to their academic careers. 
In designing mentoring interventions, law schools should keep in mind the 
need to blend the advantages of formal and informal mentoring. Relying on 
organic or spontaneous mentoring alone is likely to disadvantage diverse faculty 
members and perpetuate gender and racial disparities in retention and promotion. 
Ultimately, however, the most effective mentoring occurs informally, not as part 
of an official “match.” We believe that the best of both worlds can be found in a 
program that targets diverse faculty members, emphasizes the importance of 
mentoring, provides financial resources and moral support to empower them, and 
holds them accountable to cultivate their own network of informal mentors. 
The particular approach described here may not be ideal for all law schools. 
Indeed, it is important to emphasize that this mentoring initiative was designed 
by listening and responding to faculty preferences at our institution. The points 
we consider most central to its success were encouraging early-career faculty 
members  to  take  initiative  in  cultivating  their  own  network  of  professional 
mentors, providing appropriate financial resources to facilitate these efforts, and 
using  a  narrative  reporting  obligation  to  hold  participants  accountable  and 
facilitate reflective learning. We think that travel funding not only facilitated 
relationship-building with geographically distant mentors, but also represented 
an important hook to recruit participants who might not already be convinced of 
the value of mentoring for their academic careers. While the amount of additional 
travel support could be varied, we would caution against attempting to replicate 
this program without it. 
Our hope is that this detailed model can serve as a starting point for 
discussions regarding effective efforts to bolster mentoring as a diversity strategy. 
We also hope that we can save future program champions significant time by Dutton et. al MACRO FINAL (Do Not Delete)  1/10/2018  6:57 PM

providing ready-made resources with which to work. In the appendices, we 
include templates for our assessment tools and a logic model mapping out the 
program, which can be used during the planning and implementation of a similar 
program. These help facilitate the reflective self-assessment that we found to be an 
important part of the program, as well as evidence collection to demonstrate the 
impact of a trial program. Many campuses have funds available to support 
department-level  mentoring  initiatives;  we  have  made  our  grant  proposal 
available as a model.40 
The model described here can also be implemented without establishing a 
formal program. Early-career faculty members who are persuaded of the potential 
benefits can adopt the multiple mentoring model and begin to cultivate their own 
networks immediately. If they think they need additional financial resources to 
support travel for this purpose, they can approach their dean directly and propose 
a pilot program, sharing the literature on mentorship and promising to hold 
themselves accountable for setting and achieving mentorship goals by reporting 
on their use of the mentorship funds on an annual or semiannual basis. Deans can 
also implement this approach themselves by offering small bonus funds to their 
most junior faculty members. 
Although our experiment focused on enhancing gender diversity, the model 
can work to promote any dimension of diversity, including racial, socioeconomic, 
or political diversity.41 The model can also be adapted to target scholars at different 
points in their careers. For example, another program might focus on mid-career 
legal academics, with the goal of increasing diversity among future deans. Schools 
that send many graduates to legal academia can also adapt the program to serve 
current law students, as a way of improving the diversity pipeline. In this way, 
diversity mentorship can help to address the diversity gap in hiring, as well as in 
advancement.

Re:                          Participant self-evaluation 
 
  Thank you for participating in the inaugural year of MUSCLE. As part of the 
administration of this program, we expect all participants to complete an annual 
narrative self-assessment of their participation. Together with the anonymously 
gathered quantitative data, these narratives will help us to assess the effectiveness 
of the program, and to find ways to further improve it. This evidence can also be 
helpful to the Dean when seeking additional funding to continue the program. 
Toward that end, please prepare a 2-3 page memo explaining how you have 
utilized the resources provided by MUSCLE over the past year, and with what 
results. These memos should be returned to the chair of the research committee by 
email no later than [DATE]. You may find it helpful to address some or all of the 
following questions, although you should also feel free to go beyond these 
questions as well. No particular format is required. 
 
•    Explain  which  MUSCLE  components  (workshops,  assessment  tools, 
travel funding, mentor MVP nominations) you personally found most 
helpful this year. 
•    Please describe how you used your additional travel funds; where you 
went, who you met with, what topics your mentoring conversations 
covered, etc. 
•    What follow-up has occurred building on this travel? For example, phone 
conversations  with  mentors,  future  invitations,  reading  drafts, 
coauthorship, etc. 
•    How has the funded travel impacted your research? Have you received 
additional invitations or opportunities as a result of relationships built? 
•    How has participation in the MUSCLE program influenced the way that 
you  view  and  approach  mentoring  as  part  of  your  professional 
development? 
•    In what ways has your mentoring network gotten stronger over the past 
year? What actions of your own do you attribute that to? 
•    What steps do you want to take in the next year to further strengthen and 
best utilize these mentoring relationships? How do you propose to spend 
your travel funds? 
•    Do you consider it important to continue the MUSCLE program in the 
future? Please explain why or why not.
