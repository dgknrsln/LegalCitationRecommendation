LAW AND POLICY ENTREPRENEURS: EMPIRICAL
EVIDENCE ON THE EXPANSION OF
SCHOOL CHOICE POLICY
Michael Heise*
This study leverages event history analysis to help explain the expansion of public
charter school legislation between 1991–2006. This study expands previous work in
two important ways. First, while critical distinctions separate public charter school and
school voucher programs, both fall comfortably within the broader rubric of “school
choice.” As such, it is difficult to understand the development of state legislation for
one school choice variant independent of the other. Thus, this analysis includes the
presence of publicly- or privately-funded voucher programs in a state as a possible factor
influencing the adoption of charter school legislation in a state. Second, a methodologi-
cal contribution emerges by comparing results generated by a complementary log-log
model with results generated by a rare event logistic regression model. That school
voucher programs’ influence on the emergence of state charter schools laws is robust
across both models underscores school voucher programs’ salience to the emergence of
charter school legislation. Understanding the emergence of charter school legislation as
a defensive political move to deflect school voucher progress or a political compromise
finds support in these results. Either interpretation of the emergence of charter schools’
ascendance, however, needs to account for the school voucher programs’ influence as
well as important suburban political and economic interests.
INTRODUCTION
As Americans’ impulse and appetite for school reform endure, so
too does the public education system’s resistance to helpful, structural
change. As one leading education critic and scholar, Diane Ravitch,
noted recently: “It is a well-known fact that American education is in

crisis.”1 Moreover, this “well-known” fact is not new as the American
education system has remained in a crisis mode (albeit in varying
degrees) for at least a century.2
An impulse to wade into elementary and secondary school reform
is broadly shared and expanded relatively recently to include the fed-
eral government. Just over a decade ago, the U.S. Congress passed
the No Child Left Behind Act of 20013 (“NCLB”) which represents
the federal government’s most dramatic venture into the nation’s
schools and educational policy and reform.4 With NCLB Congress
sought  to  leverage  state  accountability  standards  in  an  effort  to
improve academic performance in general as well as to narrow the
achievement chasms that separate various student sub-groups in par-
ticular.5 According to Frederick Hess, one early legacy of NCLB is
that  “‘achievement  gaps’  became  (educational)  reformers’  catch
phrase, and closing those gaps became the goal of American educa-
tion policy.”6
To be sure, concerns over American student academic achieve-
ment and nagging differences in achievement among various student
sub-groups are well-founded.7 An international vantage point is par-
ticularly instructive as it reveals that “the performance of American
students on international tests is mediocre.”8 And this American edu-
cational mediocrity prevails even though the United States outspends
virtually all other nations when it comes to education.9
With anxiety over student academic achievement (and achieve-
ment gaps) as a central current motivation for educational reform in
this country, educational reform machinery continues to grind. Over
the  decades  numerous  reform  strategies  have  come  and  gone.10
Recently, perhaps owing to more specific concerns over the economic
and social damage inflicted by inefficacious public schools, educa-
tional reform strategies began to soften an almost instinctive institu-

tional aversion to market forces. Indeed, many current reform efforts
now openly seek to enlist and exploit market forces, though in varying
degrees, into the service of improving public schools.11 Within the
larger reform framework of subjecting public elementary and secon-
dary institutions to increased market forces, charter schools appear to
have won the battle of ideas at the moment.12 Setting aside the merits
of charter schools and other school choice policy alternatives (notably
voucher programs), what is clear is that among the various school
choice policy options, the charter school option is the clear prefer-
ence of citizens, lawmakers, and many policymakers. As such, how
charter school legislation emerged as well as how such legislation
spread across state general assemblies in the United States warrant
attention.
The historical narrative of education policy entrepreneurs’ expe-
rience in Minnesota persuading state lawmakers to enact the nation’s
first charter school program is well known.13 Far less developed, how-
ever, is an account of charter school legislation’s emergence across
the country. While case studies are particularly helpful in unearthing
state-specific nuance and context, the migration of school choice leg-
islation over time across the country benefits from event history analy-
sis and a growing event history literature.14
In  perhaps  the  most  important  and  technically  sophisticated
study  of  states’  adoption  of  charter  school  legislation  between
1991–2006, Wong and Langevin found that charter school legislation
was most likely to emerge in states with Republican governors, com-
paratively lower classroom spending levels, protracted school finance
litigation,  and  a  comparatively  higher  concentration  of  private
schools.15  Despite  their  work’s  contribution,  Wong  and  Langevin
noted limitations to their study, including possible omitted variable
bias.16 They also expressly encouraged scholars to expand upon their
work both substantively and methodologically. From a substantive

perspective, notably Wong and Langevin suggested that future schol-
ars explore whether states may have passed charter school laws “as a
political compromise to private school vouchers.”17 On more meth-
odological and technical fronts, Wong and Langevin recognized plau-
sible alternatives to their model specifications.18
This  study  responds  to  Wong  and  Langevin’s  plea  for  more
research in two small but specific ways. Substantively, to assess the
influence of school voucher programs on the emergence of charter
school law across states and over time the Wong and Langevin data set
was expanded to include relevant 1991–2006 school voucher data.19
While data are ill equipped to answer Wong and Langevin’s specific
interpretative question about whether charter school legislation is bet-
ter understood as a defensive political move designed to deflect the
voucher movement, from either a theoretical or practical vantage
point it is difficult to understand the emergence of charter school laws
independent of public and private school voucher programs. More to
the point, efforts to do so are incomplete. The policy nexus linking
school voucher and charter school programs is simply too strong to
assess the development of one policy independent of the other. Meth-
odologically, this study compares results from Wong and Langevin’s
complementary  log-log  model  with  those  from  an  alternative
approach to rare event studies, Gary King and Langche Zeng’s rare
event logistic regression model.20 Such a comparison will help assess
whether the substantive results depend upon model selection in any
way.
While results from this study largely comport with Wong and
Langevin’s earlier findings, school voucher programs’ influence on
states’ adoption of charter school laws emerges with clarity.21 Moreo-
ver, subtle structural variations between the two types of voucher pro-
grams proved important.22 Specifically, the existence of a publicly-
funded voucher program operating in a state exerted comparatively
stronger  influence  than  did  their  privately-funded  counterparts.23

Finally, the influence of voucher programs on the creation of charter
school  laws  are  robust  across  two  leading  statistical  approaches
designed to account for the emergence of rare events over time.24
The Article proceeds in four parts. Parts One and Two describe
the relevant scholarly literatures as well as the data, methodology, and
research design. The results, presented and discussed in Part Three,
illustrate  the  influence  that  school  voucher  programs  exerted  on
states’ enactment of charter school legislation. One crucial—if sub-
tle—wrinkle is that publicly-funded school voucher programs exerted
comparatively  more  influence  than  their  privately-funded  counter-
parts (though both forms of school voucher programs were influen-
tial).25 Also notable is that the main results are robust to alternative
model specifications. This Article concludes by noting that while key
findings from prior empirical work in this field, particularly earlier
work by Wong and Langevin, persist, expanding the scope of this
research to account for the influence of school voucher programs pro-
vides a richer and more textured and robust account of the growth of
charter school legislation across states between 1991–2006.
I. RESEARCH LITERATURE
In their effort to empirically account for the expansion of charter
school programs over time, Wong and Langevin created the first data
set of its kind to track various influences on the passage of state char-
ter school laws. Adopting an event history analytical framework, the
researchers found that between 1991–2006 charter school legislation
was most likely to emerge in states with Republican governors, com-
paratively lower classroom spending levels, protracted school finance
litigation,  and  a  comparatively  higher  concentration  of  private
schools.26  Despite  their  important  and  helpful  work,  Wong  and
Langevin noted important limitations to their study and expressly
encouraged scholars to expand upon their work by exploring whether
states may have passed charter school laws “as a political compromise
to private school vouchers.”27
This  study  responds  to  Wong  and  Langevin’s  call  for  such
research by expanding their data set to include relevant 1991–2006
school voucher data that facilitate analyses designed to assess the
influence of school voucher programs on the emergence of charter

independent variables in that data set).

school  law  across  states  and  over  time.  To  be  sure,  data  are  ill
equipped to answer Wong and Langevin’s specific interpretative ques-
tion about whether charter school legislation is better understood as a
defensive political move to deflect the voucher movement. Method-
ological limitations notwithstanding, it is difficult to understand the
emergence of charter school laws from either a theoretical or practi-
cal vantage point independent of public and private school voucher
programs. Thus, both theory and common sense suggest that an
empirical  account  of  the  emergence  of  charter  school  legislation
needs to include voucher program variables.
II. DATA AND METHODOLOGY
By  design  (and,  indeed,  at  the  express  urging  of  Wong  and
Langevin),28 this study draws heavily from the original data set created
by Wong and Langevin as well as their methodological approach and
basic research design. While tracking as closely as possible to their
earlier work facilitates comparisons, at the same time, where needed,
appropriate adjustments were implemented to account for the addi-
tional data and the resulting expanded data set.
One important adjustment to Wong and Langevin’s original work
(aside from the addition of new variables)—the exclusion of a sub-set
of alternative geography-based variables—warrants brief note. Wong
and Langevin included an array of geography-based variables in their
study to trace public policy’s possible migratory patterns. At the pol-
icy level, however, to the extent that educational choice policies in
general and school voucher programs in particular were national in
scope and discussion, certainly by 1992, the salience of geographic
proximity decreases. Moreover, in Wong and Langevin’s study none
of  the  geography-based  variables  achieved  statistical  significance.29
Consequently, this expansion of Wong and Langevin’s prior work
excludes the geography-based control variables.30
A. Data
While it certainly remains true that various political, social, educa-
tional, and historical perspectives contribute to any explanation of
charter school policy expansion across states and over time, this Arti-

cle approaches the research question from a quantitative perspective.
As such, theories about and explanations for the migration of charter
school legislation are subject to data. This study builds on prior work
by expanding Wong and Langevin’s leading data set in the field to
include data on voucher programs.
The dependent variable of interest is a state’s adoption of charter
school legislation. Minnesota enacted the nation’s first such legisla-
tion in 1991. Since then, thirty-nine other states enacted similar—
though  varying—charter  school  legislation.  Because  this  study
assesses the migration of charter school legislation across states and
over time, our analysis begins in 1992.31 The dependent variable—
whether a state has enacted charter school legislation—is a dummy
variable, coded “0” for each year that a state has not enacted charter
school legislation and “1” in the year of a state’s adoption of such
legislation.
The  independent  variables  cluster  into  four  sub-groups,  with
each sub-group reflecting various theoretical and practical influences
on a state’s inclination toward enacting charter school legislation.
One such sub-group of variables—indeed, the independent variables
of interest in this study—assesses whether school voucher programs
influenced the emergence of charter school legislation. Theory and
common sense suggest that school voucher programs could help stim-
ulate charter school legislation in at least two separate ways. As a state
becomes more familiar with one form of school choice (vouchers)
alternative forms of school choice (charter schools) may be perceived
as comparatively less radical and to pose less of a threat to the educa-
tion status quo. Also, and especially where voucher programs were
introduced as pilot programs or limited in scope or duration, passing
charter school legislation is one plausible legislative way to reduce
pressure to expand voucher programs. To test the hypothesized posi-
tive relation between voucher programs and the likelihood of a state
passing charter school legislation, the models include a dummy varia-
ble signaling the presence of a school voucher program operating in a
state. Moreover, in light of the potentially important ways in which
school voucher programs vary, the school voucher program variable is
coded in two separate ways. One way collapses all voucher programs
into a single dummy variable. In an alternative model specification,
separate dummy variables signal the presence of two types of school
voucher programs: voucher programs that are publicly funded and
those that are privately funded.
31 The analysis begins in 1992 as it is the calendar year following Minnesota’s
adoption of charter school legislation.\\jciprod01\productn\N\NDL\87-5\NDL505.txt unknown Seq: 8 16-AUG-12 9:49

A second sub-group of variables explores an array of political and
economic factors that plausibly influence a state’s desire to enact char-
ter school programs. One critical question involves how political lead-
ers learn about new policy initiatives, such as charter schools. While
the modern push to increase school choice generally construed thus
far has been associated with the Republican Party, the models include
a dummy variable indicating whether a state had a Republican gover-
nor, by year.
Of course, when it comes to enacting legislation state governors
cannot act alone. Thus, the gubernatorial power variable is designed
to capture differences in how executive authority is structured across
states and over time. The composite measure seeks to differentiate
governors’ ability to influence the legislative process as a function of
such factors as a governor’s tenure in office, appointment authority,
budget control, veto authority, and party control over the state legisla-
tive branch. While it is hypothesized that Republican governors are
more partial to charter school legislation, Republican governors with
robust gubernatorial power are more likely to see their policy prefer-
ences enacted into legislation.
Economic factors also warrant consideration and inclusion in the
model.  While  the  percentage  of  the  state  contribution  to  local
schools’ budgets is not inexorably tied to policy control, increased fis-
cal decentralization is typically associated with increased policy diffu-
sion and experimentation.32 Moreover, a state’s relative contribution
to a local school budget typically reflects the degree to which citizens
support traditional local public schools.33 Thus, as it relates to a
state’s adoption of charter school legislation, as the percentage of a
state’s contribution to local school budgets increases, the likelihood
that the state enacts charter school legislation decreases.34 Relatedly,
because charter school legislation often increases teachers’ classroom
discretion, it follows that states with comparatively lower levels of class-
room per pupil spending and higher student-teacher ratios would be
more inclined to pursue charter school legislation. As well, another

Urban Policymaking, 32 AM. J. POL. SCI. 1, 1 (1988) (arguing that “urban policymaking
can be the result of political choice as well as economic consideration”).
34 C.f. Wong & Langevin, supra note 14, at 451 (“Due to the greater degree of
professional discretion represented in state authorization of charter schools, it makes
conceptual sense that states with relatively lower levels of classroom spending and
higher pupil-teacher ratios will be more likely to adopt charter school legislation.”).

proxy for the financial condition of schools—pupil-teacher ratio—is
also presumed to influence prospects for charter school legislation.
Specifically, states experiencing larger pupil-teacher ratios should be
more receptive to charter school policies.
Moreover,  because  school  finance  litigation  poses  a  threat  to
local school autonomy as well as educational status quo, such litiga-
tion in a state should increase the prospects of charter school legisla-
tion.35 Challenges presented by school finance litigation should make
lawmakers more receptive to re-thinking existing and alternative pub-
lic  school  structures  and  delivery  mechanisms  of  educational  ser-
vices.36  Hypothesizing  a  positive  relation  between  school  finance
litigation activity and the likelihood of charter school legislation rein-
forces policy entrepreneurs’ motivation to cast charter school legisla-
tion as a market-sensitive reform with strong fiscal incentives for state
institutions.37
A third sub-group of control variables dwells on important social
and education factors. A school’s racial composition endures as a fac-
tor of interest, particularly in light of the complicated (and often odi-
ous) intersection of race and schooling throughout American history.
The many and continually evolving ways in which race and school
choice policies intersect complicate matters further. Many scholars
note,  however,  the  important  and  growing  support  for  increased
school choice among minority families, particular African-American
families.38 Consequently, an increase in the percentage of minority
students (elementary and secondary) should increase the likelihood
that a state enacts charter school legislation.39
As well, states that enjoy comparatively higher per capita personal
income will likely be more inclined to entrepreneurial policies, such
as charter school legislation.40 Indeed, not only are states with higher
personal incomes more likely to be receptive to social changes, but
such states must also respond to comparatively higher demands of
state  residents  for  more  effective  and  efficient  governmental
services.41

An  additional  education  factor—the  presence  of  private
schools—likely influences the prospects of passing charter school leg-
islation in a state.42 Not only do private schools make any voucher
programs a practical possibility, but the private schools’ market share
reflects the degree to which families can select out—and have selected
out—of public school options.43 Thus, private schools’ market share
also serves as an imperfect proxy for parental (and student) demand
for alternatives to traditional public schools, including public charter
schools.44
The final sub-group of individual variables attempts to measure
temporal dependence. The need to account for temporal depen-
dence is underscored by the variation in the hazard rate for event
occurrence over time (see Figure 2, below).45 Wong and Langevin
describe the various options for measuring temporal dependence.46
To maximize comparability with the Wong and Langevin study and to
reduce analytic stress on assumptions regarding the functional form
of time, analyses in this study use a control variable—duration depen-
dency—to account for any temporal dependence among observations
across time.
B. Methodology
Event history analysis seeks to lever comparisons of the relative
contributions of internal and external variables presumed to influ-
ence state legislative processes through the hazard rate. The hazard
rate reflects the probability of a state adopting charter school legisla-
tion  conditioned  on  prior  event  nonoccurrence  as  well  as  other
covariates. Put more plainly, in this study the hazard rate provides a
measure of the relative likelihood of a state adopting charter school
legislation over time.
As the dependent variable is dichotomous (that is, in any given
year a state either did or did not adopt a charter school program),
logit or probit are the standard regression models. However, as Pow-
ers and Xie note,47 fitting a maximum likelihood complementary log-
log model is an appropriate alternative to a logit or probit model

where, as here, a positive (or negative) dependant variable outcome is
heavily skewed.48 Moreover, as Wong and Langevin observe, fitting a
complementary log-log model is preferable for theoretical reasons as
well. Specifically, the complementary log-log model’s asymmetrical
response curve better fits the “theoretical basis of policy diffusion in
the American federal system.”49
While the rationale for Wong and Langevin’s decision to prefer a
complementary log-log strategy over the more conventional logit and
probit  regression  models  makes  sense,  technical  questions  persist
about the appropriate strategy to account for the temporal depen-
dence among states. Though Wong and Langevin acknowledge plau-
sible alternatives, for perfectly defensible reasons they adopted the
Box-Steffensmeier approach.50 To insure that results from this study
are robust to model specification, this study also incorporates one
alternative approach (King and Zeng’s rare event logit51) as a strategy
to address the temporal dependence challenge and compares results
from both alternatives.
Finally, alternative specifications are explored for each model.
While all school voucher programs can quite plausibly be classified
similarly, whether a school voucher program is publicly or privately
funded may influence a state’s political attraction to public charter
school programs.
III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The presentation of results begins with a graphical description of
the growth of various school choice programs over time. Regression
results follow the descriptive results.
A. Descriptive Results
Minnesota passed the nation’s first charter school legislation in
1991. Despite charter schools’ head start, the number of (modern)
school voucher programs caught and surpassed the number of states
enacting charter school laws by the next year (1992). Beginning in
1994,  the  number  of  states  adopting  charter  school  legislation
increased steadily until 1999, while the number of voucher programs
remained comparatively static. The number of states adopting charter
school legislation topped-out in 2003 at forty. In addition to present-

Charter Public Vouchers Private Vouchers
While Figure 1 describes the increase in the number of states with
publicly- and privately-funded voucher programs as well as charter
school legislation over time, the specific dependent variable of inter-
est is whether a state enacted charter school legislation and, if it did,
when did it do so. The main research hypothesis is that the existence
of some form of a school voucher program in a state increased the
probability that the state would adopt charter school legislation. On
this latter point, Figure 2 provides a graphical description of the dis-
crete hazard rates of state charter school adoptions over time.
As  Wong  and  Langevin  note,  the  hazard  rate  in  Figure  2  is
nonmonotonic and characterized by multiple peaks and troughs.52
The multiple peaks as well as the basic shape of the hazard rates imply
that a state’s adoption of charter school legislation was neither wholly
random nor independent of time.

B. Regression Results
While the descriptive results presented in Figures 1 and 2 provide
helpful general information and hint at possible relations among vari-
ous forms of school choice policies, assessing specific independent
influence of various factors requires more sophisticated analyses. The
key independent variables of interest—and what distinguishes this
study from Wong and Langevin’s prior work—involve the possible
impact of voucher programs on a state’s inclination to adopt charter
school legislation.
The results, presented in Table 1, make clear how the existence
of school voucher programs influenced the likelihood of a state’s
adoption of charter school legislation. Notably, this association is par-
ticularly strong for publicly-funded voucher programs. Finally, that
the  main  findings  persist  across  both  methodological  approaches
enhances the core findings’ robustness. That is, the selection of any
particular statistical test did not influence the core findings.
Results presented in Table 1 support three main substantive find-
ings. First, the existence of a voucher program in a state achieves sta-
tistical  significance  and  in  the  hypothesized  (positive)  direction.
When privately- and publicly-funded voucher programs are consid-
ered separately (models 2 and 4), however, the results illustrate the
particular salience of publicly-funded programs.\\jciprod01\productn\N\NDL\87-5\NDL505.txt unknown Seq: 14 16-AUG-12 9:49

The second central finding is that the main results are substan-
tially robust across competing models (complementary log-log versus
rare event logit). While it may be easy to ascribe this finding to tech-
nical statistical minutiae, its importance partially resides in buttressing
the robustness of the main findings across various (and competing)
modeling specifications. Consequently, these findings enhance the
confidence that the results are, in fact, real and neither model-depen-
dent nor statistical artifacts.
A third notable finding is that expanding the original data set to
include  school  voucher  program  data  did  not  dislodge  the  main
thrust  of  Wong  and  Langevin’s  prior  findings.  More  specifically,
although the new independent variables of interest—school voucher
programs—achieve  statistical  significance,  they  do  not  eliminate
Wong and Langevin’s emphasis on various political, economic, and\\jciprod01\productn\N\NDL\87-5\NDL505.txt unknown Seq: 15 16-AUG-12 9:49

social variables that also correlate with a state’s adoption of charter
school laws. Notably, similar to what Wong and Langevin found, in
this  study  coefficients  for  a  Republican  governor,  classroom-level
spending, the percentage of minority students, private schools’ mar-
ket presence, and durational dependence persisted in achieving vary-
ing levels of statistical significance in the predicted direction. Thus, if
anything, findings from this study illustrate that Wong and Langevin’s
findings  persist  even  after  introducing  the  influence  of  school
voucher programs into the models.
C. Discussion
The influence of school voucher programs on a state’s appetite
for charter school legislation, hinted at in the descriptive findings, sur-
vives regression analyses that simultaneously account for multiple fac-
tors. As this study focuses on the 1991–2006 time period, the data
capture  only  the  initial  cohort  of  voucher  programs  and  charter
schools. Nevertheless, interpretations of charter school legislation’s
emergence across the country during those years need to account for
school voucher programs’ influence, particularly in states that oper-
ated publicly-funded voucher programs.
That the existence of a voucher program increased the likelihood
that a state would adopt charter school legislation comports with com-
mon sense. That publicly-funded school voucher programs increased
this likelihood even more than privately-funded programs, however,
raises an array of related questions. One question, posed by Wong
and Langevin, is whether states adopted charter school legislation “as
a political compromise to private school voucher[]” programs.53
What  is  ironic  from  a  policy  perspective  is  that  many  school
voucher supporters, especially those behind privately-funded voucher
programs, made clear their desire for such programs to stimulate
broader, comprehensive publicly-funded voucher programs.54 For an
array of reasons that desire did not come to pass. What did emerge
over time, however, was a different  form of school choice—charter
schools. What actually motivated and explains the emergence of char-
ter school legislation—some of it in states with school voucher pro-
grams—is not particularly amenable to precise empirical testing. A
closer look at the salient political-economic context in general and
the  role  of  suburbs  and  suburban  schools  in  particular,  however,
reveals important clues.

D. Charter School Legislation as Political “Compromise” or “Reality”
To consider whether the emergence of charter school legislation
was a political “compromise” by those seeking to deflect the more dra-
matic and structural changes posed by school voucher programs nec-
essarily  implies  that  the  prospect  of  school  voucher  programs
constituted a politically meaningful and viable option. Experience
suggests  otherwise,  however,  and  the  political  economy  of  school
vouchers suggests why this is so. What remains critical to understand-
ing the comparative demise of school vouchers and emergence of
charter school legislation, as Professor Jim Ryan and I noted previ-
ously, is the key role played by suburbs (and suburban public school
districts).55 More to the point, suburban interests largely impeded sig-
nificant expansion of school voucher programs.56 As such, the expres-
sion of suburban interests in the politics of education in the United
States supplies helpful context for the interpretation of the empirical
results from this study.
It is important to begin by observing that the political process has
been quite hard on school voucher proposals. Far more voucher
plans have been rejected than have passed. Between 1990 and 1993
alone, for example, fourteen state legislatures considered and ulti-
mately rejected voucher proposals. Voucher or tax-credit initiatives
also appeared on a number of state ballots in the 1990s, including
ones in California, Colorado, Oregon, and Washington. In each case,
voters not only rejected the proposals, but did so by wide margins.57
Finally, virtually every proposal to provide vouchers on a large scale
has failed.58
Understandably,  and  with  considerable  justification,  school
choice  supporters  reflexively  blamed  teachers  unions  for  school
voucher initiative losses at the ballot boxes. After all, unions greatly
outspent voucher proponents on voucher initiative campaigns.59 In
addition, teacher unions’ formidable financial resources lubricated
efforts to get unions’ substantial membership lists to the polls. The
combination of resources, sheer numbers, and political and profes-

sional motivation gelled into an important barrier to school voucher
initiatives.
While it remains quite difficult to overstate the effect of teacher
unions’ opposition on voucher initiative political failures, it remains
possible to do just that. Teacher unions could not have been solely
responsible for the political deaths of school voucher initiatives. In
California, for example, the voucher initiative was crushed at the polls
by a seventy-one to twenty-nine percent margin.60 The substantial
margin of defeat suggests that:
[v]oucher ballot initiatives lost in California (and elsewhere)
not only, and perhaps not even primarily, because teachers’ unions
opposed them, but also because suburbanites opposed them as well.
As John J. Miller, associate director of the pro-voucher Manhattan
Institute, explained after the defeat of the 1993 voucher ballot initi-
ative  in  California:  “School  choice  failed  in  California  because
Republican  voters  didn’t  want  it.”  Some  voucher  proponents
explained the defeat by pointing to teachers’ unions and the biased
media, but Miller argued that the real explanation had more to do
with suburban apathy:
Most suburbanites—the folks who make up the GOP’s rank
and file—are happy with their kids’ school systems. Their chil-
dren already earn good grades, score well on tests, and gain
admission into reputable colleges and universities. Moreover, sub-
urban affluence grants a measure of freedom in choosing where
to  live  and  thus  provides  at  least  some  control  over  school
selection.61
Despite formidable teacher union and suburban political opposi-
tion, however, a few school voucher programs emerged. While impor-
tant and notable exceptions exist, in general where school voucher
programs have emerged they have done so in discrete, bounded con-
texts.62 Or, more to the point, where voucher programs took root
they did so in places and in ways that posed comparatively less of a
threat to suburban interests.63 For example, both privately- and pub-
licly-funded voucher programs arose with frequency in urban jurisdic-
tions noted for struggling public schools and high concentrations of
poverty.64 For either political or logistical reasons, many (but not all)

voucher pilot programs are geographically limited to urban school
district boundaries.65 In the one large-scale voucher program that
does permit eligible students to access public schools in neighboring
more affluent suburbs, Ohio law leaves it to those suburban school
districts to decide whether to participate in the Ohio program and
accept voucher-funded students who reside in Cleveland.66 If any eli-
gible students attend non-Cleveland schools, the number of such stu-
dents is exceptionally small. Moreover, in states that implemented
state-wide voucher programs, such as Florida, across-district participa-
tion was dampened by the absence of student transportation assis-
tance and the ability of public schools already operating at capacity to
decline student transfers.67
An effort to gain a clearer understanding of why suburbs might
be structurally opposed to voucher initiatives requires taking suburbs’
political economic interests seriously. Most suburban homeowners
“paid a premium in purchasing their homes [partly] to ensure that
their children [could] attend good public schools, and they—like
their neighbors—want to protect [their suburban public] schools and
[residential] property values.”68 “A wide-ranging voucher program,
which allows resident students to exit freely and nonresident students
to enter suburban schools,” poses at least two distinct threats to subur-
ban interests.69 First, at some point voucher programs might siphon
public dollars away from suburban public schools.70 Second, high-
performing suburban public schools might attract voucher-eligible
students geographically assigned to lower-performing urban public
schools.71 Many students assigned to and attending lower-performing
urban  public  schools  are  non-white  and  from  lower-income
households.72
The extent to which a voucher program facilitates student migra-
tion from lower-performing urban public schools to more attractive
suburban schools reduces school voucher programs’ attractiveness to

many suburban parents and homeowners alike.73 Indeed, one critical
factor that attracts many families to suburbs—suburbs’ ability to con-
trol access to suburban schools—is directly threatened by voucher pol-
icies.74  Robust  school  choice  policies  degrade  the  link  between
suburban homes and access to neighboring suburban schools.75 For
many (but certainly not all) suburbanites, especially those with school-
age children, this turns at least part of the logic of locating to suburbs
on its head.76
By contrast, the typical charter school program poses far less of a
threat to suburban interests in general and the link between suburban
homes and their neighboring schools in particular. Owing partly to
geography, many charter schools locate in urban areas to leverage the
market  of  students  assigned  to  struggling  urban  public  schools.77
When charter schools do venture into suburban areas, however, while
they typically do open their school doors to nonresident students, sub-
urbs still retain control over access to their suburban schools. Thus,
while the emergence of charter schools in suburban areas pose some
level of threat to the overall funding of suburban public schools as
well as the introduction of nonresident students into suburban-based
charter schools, suburbs still maintain control over access to their sub-
urban public schools. Consequently, the deleterious implications for
suburban  home  prices  are  dampened.  While  the  emergence  of
school choice policies is far from ideal for many suburbs, charter
schools are comparatively more palatable as they pose comparatively
less of a threat to suburbs’ interests.
These key structural differences between voucher and charter
school policies provide one account of the relevant political dynamics.
Within the realm of state and local politics, few if any issues are
more highly visible than those concerning schools and education.
[As a result,] electoral majorities are keenly interested in education
issues. [In many states] suburban legislators possess . . . the political
power, as well as the political incentives, to protect their constitu-
ents’ interests.78

1936 notre dame law review [vol. 87:5
Thus, in a contest between school voucher and charter school
policies, why many governors—particularly Republican governors—
often prefer the latter over the former is easily understood.
Governor Wilson, for example, opposed the 1993 California ballot
initiative, just as Republican Governor Engler (as well as Republican
Senator Spencer Abraham) opposed the recent voucher initiative in
Michigan.  Similarly,  Governor  Whitman  toyed  with  a  modest
voucher proposal for New Jersey students, but ultimately let it die in
the face of legislative opposition from both Democrats and Republi-
cans. . . . Surely these Republican leaders were not trying to court
the teachers’ unions by opposing or dropping their calls for vouch-
ers. More likely, these Republican governors responded to the less-
than-enthusiastic message sent by their suburban constituents.79
For whatever the reasons, while results from this study do not
speak to the relation (likely positive) between Republican governors
and school voucher programs, they do illustrate that a Republican
governor  increased  a  state’s  likelihood  of  passing  charter  school
legislation.
With these political and economic dynamics in mind, it becomes
easier to understand why the three publicly-funded voucher pro-
grams operating today look the way they do. The programs in Mil-
waukee and Cleveland offer vouchers to a limited number of poor
students to attend private schools. The Milwaukee plan explicitly
limits the use of vouchers to private schools within city boundaries,
thus assuring that Milwaukee voucher students will not enter subur-
ban schools. While the Cleveland plan allows students to use the
vouchers at any school within Cleveland and also at any suburban
public school that agrees to accept voucher students, the over-
whelming majority of participating students attend private and relig-
ious schools. Florida’s plan, which is the most recently adopted and
the only ostensibly statewide program, allows students in failing
schools to use vouchers at private or public schools. The program
pushes students to choose nearby public or private schools, how-
ever, as it fails to provide transportation to private schools and
explicitly  requires  parents  to  transport  their  children  to  public
schools in other districts, which must accept voucher students only
if space is available.
Just as these programs are not designed to send voucher students
to the local equivalents of, say, Exeter, Hotchkiss, or Choate, it is also
obvious that these programs are not meant to avail suburban public
schools to inner-city students. This fact is apparent from the structure

2012] law and policy entrepreneurs 1937
of the programs, and it is understandable in light of the political
forces that shaped the plans.
In Milwaukee and Cleveland, for example, minority leaders teamed
with state and local Republican leaders to create these programs,
which in turn reflect their respective interests. The minority leaders
pushing for the programs were interested primarily in improving
the  educational  opportunities  available  to  students  in  failing
schools, and they tended not to be interested in enhancing oppor-
tunities  for  racial  integration.  Republican  leaders,  meanwhile,
seized  the  opportunity  to  support  a  market-based  educational
reform that would operate largely within the confines of urban
school districts. Urban vouchers allow Republican leaders to push a
policy that is ideologically attractive and politically low-risk, as it
leaves suburbanites alone. If anything, urban vouchers will win the
support and votes of suburbanites, because they offer assistance to
urban students. [Many] [s]uburbanites continue to express support
for programs that offer greater assistance to inner-city students in
failing schools. At the same time, however, criticizing the bureau-
cracy of urban school districts as inefficient and corrupt is a popular
sport among many legislators and governors, some of whom must
believe that doing so plays well in the suburbs. All of which suggests
that a reform that does not provide large sums of money to city-
school  bureaucrats,  but  instead  allows  parents  to  escape  the
clutches of those bureaucrats, is likely to be pretty popular among
suburbanites—provided,  however,  that  urban  kids  [remain]  in
urban schools.80
CONCLUSION
The current and growing taste for increased education choice is
clear. While the world of education choice includes numerous vari-
ants, voucher and charter school policies emerged with significant
fanfare in the early 1990s and dominated educational reform debates.
Notwithstanding competing (and sometimes confusing) claims about
the respective efficacy of voucher and charter school policies, by 2006
it was clear that charter school advocates had won the political battle
of ideas and largely displaced voucher programs from a central posi-
tion in current educational reform policy discourse.
Prior empirical accounts of the nation-wide spread of charter
school  legislation  emphasized  politics,  classroom  spending,  school
finance litigation, and the supply of private schools. Results from this
study comport with prior research and introduce school voucher pro-
grams as an independent factor contributing to the expansion of char-

ter  school  legislation  across  states.  Moreover,  the  presence  of  a
publicly-funded voucher program exerted a stronger influence on the
likelihood of charter school legislation in a state than did a privately-
funded voucher program. Finally, the influence of voucher programs
on the passage of charter school legislation persists across competing
statistical models.
It is not without irony that school voucher programs helped stim-
ulate the emergence of charter school programs and that charter
school programs quickly became the most politically popular form of
school choice. After all, one important motivation for early, and typi-
cally  small,  pilot  school  voucher  programs—particularly  privately-
funded  programs—was  to  help  stimulate  and  contribute  political
momentum  for  the  development  of  broader,  state-wide  publicly-
funded school voucher programs.
That school voucher programs contributed to the spread of char-
ter school legislation across much of the United States maps onto sub-
urbs’ political-economic interests. At the level of real politics, school
voucher proposals confronted often fatal opposition from the existing
public education status quo (notably teacher unions) as well as subur-
banites. Voucher programs directly threaten public education inter-
ests; the negative implications for suburbs, while perhaps more subtle,
are nonetheless both important and real. The introduction of school
vouchers implicates suburbs in two important ways. First, setting aside
the eventual negative per pupil spending implications for suburban
schools, voucher programs degrade suburbs’ control over access to
suburban schools. Second, to the extent that suburban home values
reflect control over access to the typically comparatively better-per-
forming suburban public schools, reduced control over access to sub-
urban  schools  dilutes  suburban  residential  real  estate  values.  In
contrast, the typical charter school program poses comparatively far
fewer adverse consequences for suburbs and suburban schools. From
the perspective of suburban political-economic self-interest, the pref-
erence for charter schools over voucher programs is predictable.
Americans’ appetite for educational reform persists. During the
past few decades, reformers’ aversion to harnessing market forces into
the service of educational reform has lessened. The introduction of
greater market pressures in the education context can take many
forms, and important differences distinguish charter and voucher pro-
grams and policies. While it is clear charter school policies eclipsed
school voucher programs between 1991 and 2006, why this happened
is less understood. An accounting and deeper understanding of why
