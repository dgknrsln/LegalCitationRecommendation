Breakfast at Tiffany's.  The very phrase evokes  a cosmo-
politan world of cocktail  parties,  cigarette  holders,  and spar-
kling conversation that forms the backdrop of Truman Capote's
tale of loneliness and longing.3  Capote's choice of Tiffany to es-
tablish  a mood  of elegant  sophistication  in his  title was  no
small  matter.  Consider  an  alternative  like  Breakfast at
Denny's. It might be a great title for something, but the image
conjured up is-to put it mildly-not the same.
Such is the power of trademarks to convey  information.4

"Denny's."  See 15 U.S.C. § 1127 (1994) (stating that trademarks include "any
word, name, symbol, or device or any combination thereof).  One example is
trade dress, which refers to "that arrangement of identifying characteristics
connected with a product, whether by packaging or otherwise, intended to

preventing  others from copying a source-identifying  mark, re-
duce[s]  the customer's  costs of shopping and making purchas-
ing decisions."5  This is because  "a potential  customer  [is  as-
sured] that this item-the item with this mark-is made by the
same producer as other similarly marked items that he or she
liked (or disliked) in the past."6  Moreover, "the law helps as-
sure a producer that it (and not an imitating competitor) will
reap the financial, reputation-related rewards associated with a
7
desirable product."
Although the purpose of trademark protection is clear, the
framework for evaluating  trademark claims  has become quite
muddled.8  Traditionally, mark owners seeking to enjoin unau-
thorized uses of their mark have been required to show that the
unauthorized use creates a "likelihood of consumer confusion"
under infringement theory.9  In recent years,  however, an al-
ternative approach to protecting marks-dilution-has  gained
a considerable  following.10  Unlike infringement, dilution does
make the source of the product distinguishable from another and to promote
its sale."  Esercizio v. Roberts, 944 F.2d 1235, 1239-40 (6th Cir. 1991).  When
trade dress is alleged in the good itself rather than in its packaging, protection
of the so-called "product configuration" is sometimes treated differently from
ordinary marks and trade dress.  Duraco Prods., Inc. v. Joy Plastic Enters.,
Ltd.,  40 F.3d  1431,  1434 (3d  Cir.  1994).  For ease  of reading,  the terms
"marks" and "trademarks" will be used interchangeably to refer to all valid
representations of commercial identity.

not require a finding of likely consumer confusion.11  The foun-
der of dilution, Frank I. Schechter, believed that the real injury
caused by concurrent uses of a mark was not consumer confu-
sion, but was "the gradual whittling away or dispersion of the
identity and hold upon the public mind of the mark or name by
its use upon non-competing goods."12  Accordingly, under dilu-
tion laws a mark owner need only establish that an unauthor-
ized use creates a likelihood of dilution to the mark's distinct-
13
iveness.
The enactment  of the Federal Trademark Dilution Act of
199514 (FTDA) opened a wide rift between the supporters of in-
fringement  and  dilution.15  Prior  to the  FTDA's  arrival,  the
fundamental  differences  between  these two  models  of trade-
mark protection did not present a serious problem because di-
lution was  a remedy available  only in a minority  of states.16
But the elevation of dilution into a federal question has raised
the stakes for those on both sides of the debate who believe that

infringement and dilution are incompatible and cannot coexist
in the long run.17
Since the Supreme  Court has not yet examined  the rela-
tionship between  infringement  and  dilution,  each trademark
camp has turned to the time-honored tactic of hurling brickbats
at the  other.  For proponents  of infringement,  dilution  is "a
radical  and imprudent  alternative to the consumer  protection
model of trademark rights" that threatens to  create property
rights in gross for marks.18  Moreover, they fear that unless di-
lution laws  are  harshly restricted by the courts,  the dilution
concept could swallow up infringement entirely. 19  Advocates of
dilution, on the other hand, insist that marks should be treated
like property and protected from uses that are not covered by
the likelihood  of confusion test.20  Dilutionists  complain  that
courts  frequently ignore  the literal terms  of dilution statutes
and read onerous requirements  into them in order to preserve
infringement as the sole trademark remedy.21

[and]  hence  the legal harm sought to  be prevented."22  Since
any concurrent use of a mark diminishes that mark's distinct-
iveness in some  sense, separating unauthorized uses  that di-
lute from those that do not has proven quite difficult.23  Unless
dilution is read to prohibit virtually all unauthorized uses of a
given mark, the doctrine can begin "to lose its coherence as a
legally enforceable norm."24

to its enemies, the theory was a popular tool to resolve trade-

main name ownership or the abuse of search engine metatags,
dilution was often the remedy of choice.26  Even the doctrine's
sharpest critics maintained a curious silence with respect to di-
lution's application  in cyberspace.27  This  suggests that while
the rationale for dilution remains unsatisfactory, the result of
successful  dilution actions-trademark  protection-is  still de-
sirable in some circumstances where no likelihood of confusion
exists.
This Article  recharacterizes  the relationship  between in-
fringement  and dilution and formulates principles  for the ap-
propriate use of dilution.  Upon careful examination, the view
that these two paradigms of trademark protection are irrecon-
cilable dissolves.  Instead, infringement  and dilution are com-
plementary  doctrines  focused  on a single goal: preventing the
substantial impairment of trademark functions.  To see the un-
derlying unity  of trademark  law,  however,  dilution  must be
read as a limited remedy for infringement obsolescence.28
Most of the time, the means developed by the common law
to  protect  trademark  functions-infringement  and  the  con-
sumer  confusion  test-do the  trick.  But  we  cannot  mix  up
means with ends.  Consumer confusion is a fallible term of art
for trademark protection,  not a magic talisman.29  During the
first half of the twentieth century, the scope of consumer confu-
sion was widely criticized as too narrow to safeguard marks in
the wake of the Industrial Revolution.30  Then, from the 1940s
26.  See, e.g., Panavision Intl L.P. v. Toeppen, 141 F.3d 1316, 1326-27 (9th
Cir. 1998); 141 CONG. REC. S19312 (daily ed. Dec. 29, 1995) (statement of Sen.
Leahy) ("[I]t is my hope that [the FTDA] can help stem the use of deceptive
Internet addresses taken by those who are choosing marks that are associated
with the products and reputations  of others."); Nathenson, supra note 25, at
118-21.  But see Jennifer Golinveaux, What's in a Domain Name: Is "Cyber-
squatting"T rademark Dilution?,3 3 U.S.F. L. REv. 641, 671 (1999) (concluding
that dilution should not be used to address domain name disputes).  For more

28.  "Obsolescence" in this context refers to legal standards that are inade-
quate because they are based on pragmatic assumptions made under substan-
tially different economic and social conditions.

trine).2001] ONE AND INSEPARABLE 955
until the early 1960s, infringement cases were analyzed under
a framework that had a problematic relationship to confusion.31
And recently, the consumer confusion  concept has again come
under attack as incapable of handling the arrival of the Infor-
mation Age.32
At the heart of each of these examples is the pragmatic re-
lationship  between economic  change  and trademark  doctrine.
Over the last century, structural  changes  in the marketplace
have  periodically  altered  the  commercial  function  of marks.
When  these  rare  and  profound  structural  events  occur,  in-
fringement may initially fail in its goal of protecting trademark
functions from substantial impairment.  This happens because
infringement  remains mired in an outdated understanding  of
what marks are supposed to do.  Eventually, the common law
addresses this legal obsolescence by expanding the definition of
consumer confusion, well beyond what was once thought possi-
ble, to meet the new marketing practices.33  In the interim pe-
riod, however, infringement doctrine  can impede the develop-
ment of new channels  of commerce  by underprotecting marks
that consumers rely upon for information.
Dilution  is  best  understood  as  the  transitional  law  of
trademark.34  By dispensing with the consumer confusion re-
31.  See S.C. Johnson & Son, Inc. v. Johnson, 175 F.2d 176, 180 (2d Cir.
1949) (L. Hand, C.J.) (establishing that trademark infringement extended to
uses  on non-competing products  if the  unauthorized use might "stain the
[mark]  owner's reputation in the minds of his customers"); Justin Hughes,

REV. 923, 998 (1999) (noting the paradox that "the likelihood of confusion...
is arguably increased the more the infringing goods are of the same quality as
the trademark owner's goods" notwithstanding the doctrine's  opposite posi-
tion); see also Polaroid Corp. v. Polarad Elecs. Corp., 287 F.2d 492, 495 (2d Cir.
1961)  (Friendly, J.) (analyzing infringement under the modern eight-factor
test).
32.  See, e.g., Duffey, supra note 15, at 147-49; Nathenson, supra note 25,
at 111-15.
33.  "Common law" in this context refers to the judicial elaboration of stat-
utes that have delegated broad lawmaking authority to the courts.  Since the
middle of this century, trademark law has been based on broad statutes such
as the Lanham Act.  See Lanham Trade-Mark Act,  15 U.S.C. §§  1051-1127
(1994)  (the Lanham  Act); see  also Stephen  L.  Carter, The  Trouble With
Trademark, 99 YALE L.J. 759, 759 n.1 (1990) (explaining that federal trade-
mark statutes prior to the Lanham Act did not create substantive rights).
34.  Dilution is one of many doctrines that update obsolete intellectual
property law.  See Bruce P. Keller, Condemned To Repeat the Past: The Re-
emergence of Misappropriationa nd Other Common Law Theories of Protection
for Intellectual Property, 11 HARV. J.L. & TECH. 401, 412 (1997); Douglas Gary
Lichtman, The Economics of Innovation: Protecting Unpatentable Goods, 81956 MINNESOTA LAW REVIEW [Vol.  85:949
quirement,  Schechter  enabled  courts  to  provide  relief in  cir-
cumstances where they otherwise could not because the defini-
tion of confusion  had become  obsolete.35  Although  Schechter
himself envisioned a broader role  for dilution, a more limited
version has gradually emerged from courts struggling to protect
the changing function of marks in our economy.  Once dilution
is  construed  as  an  infringement  obsolescence  remedy, rather
than  as  a  comprehensive  effort  to  reinvent  trademark  law,
many mysteries of dilution doctrine can be solved.36
With the explosion in Internet commerce, we have seen an-
other transition for marks and a corresponding renaissance  in
dilution law.  After the upheaval of the Industrial Revolution,
marks primarily became symbols of quality rather than indica-
tors of source.37  This shift led directly to Schechter's dilution
proposal.38  In cyberspace, web sites have made marks increas-
ingly important as  indicators  of retail location.  Thus, courts
and commentators  again  found  infringement doctrine  lacking
and often relied on dilution to prevent the substantial impair-
ment  of the location function by cybersquatters  and parasitic
metatags.39  At the same  time, however,  a new expansion  of
consumer confusion is underway with the passage of the Anti-
cybersquatting Consumer Protection Act (ACPA) and the rise of
"initial interest confusion" doctrine.40
MINN. L. REV. 693, 732-33 (1997).
35.  See, e.g., Kieger, supra note 9, at 810 ("Judged in its historical con-
text, Schechter's dilution proposal is best understood as a dramatic reaction to
the inability or unwillingness of courts and legislatures to reform trademark
law in light of the post-Industrial Revolution trade explosion.").  From this
Klieger  draws  the conclusion  that  "ensuing  reforms  [to  consumer  confu-
sion] ...  quickly deprived dilution of any legitimate role in modern trademark
law."  Id.  As this analysis will demonstrate, Klieger overstates his strong case
against the broad application of dilution statutes.

"tarnishment" law, see infra Part V.A-B.

Part I of this Article analyzes the current struggle between
infringement and dilution.  Part II returns to the founding of
dilution and rejects Schechter's broad formulation after probing
both his original proposal and the puzzles of dilution doctrine.
Part III reinterprets Schechter's idea as a remedy against in-
fringement  obsolescence,  and  then  places  this  construction
within the wider debate on fixing outdated laws.  Parts IV and
V provide support for an obsolescence  reading of dilution and
offer guidance  on how to interpret the FTDA.  Part VI exam-
ines the alteration of marks into location symbols by the Inter-
net and dilution's subsequent revival.
I.  THE TANGLED THREADS OF TRADEMARK
Trademark law has been a leading showcase for the great
common law judges.41  This Part enters that arena and explores
the present state of trademark doctrine.  After a review of the
basics, the focus turns to the feud between infringement  and
dilution.
A.  INFRINGEMENT
According  to infringement  theory, marks  need protection
because  they  provide  consumers  with  valuable  information
about the characteristics of goods and services.42  Imagine what
shopping would be  like without marks.  Years ago, a famous
slogan told people "Don't Squeeze the Charmin," even though it
was  impossible  to  resist.  If marks  like  Charmin  were  not
around, however, we would have to squeeze the Charmin and
everything else in order to make even the most mundane pur-
chasing decisions.  Since each product line would look identical
to  its competitors, there would be  no way to figure out how
worthwhile any item was without subjecting it  to  a thorough
examination.  In a world with marks, however, consumers can
easily gauge a product's quality based on advertising or on the
prior performance of items that bore the same mark.43  By low-
41.  See, e.g., Abercrombie & Fitch Co. v. Hunting World, Inc., 537 F.2d 4,
7 (2d Cir. 1976) (Friendly, J.); S.C. Johnson & Son, Inc. v. Johnson, 175 F.2d
176, 177 (2d Cir. 1949) (L.H and, C.J.); id. at 180 (Clark, J., dissenting); Tri-
angle Publ'ns, Inc. v. Rohrlich, 167 F.2d 969, 970 (2d Cir. 1948) (A. Hand, J.);
id. at 974 (Frank, J., dissenting).
42.  See, e.g., Carter, supra note 33, at 761.
43.  See id.; Klieger, supra note 9, at 790.MINNESOTA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 85:949
ering customer search costs in this fashion, marks greatly fa-
cilitate commercial transactions.44
Marks also encourage producers to invest in quality by en-
suring that they will reap  the benefit  of a fine  reputation.45
Without trademark protection, competitors could poach on the
goodwill  of a firm by putting that firm's mark  on their  own
goods.  For  instance,  if every  company  that  produced  soft
drinks could place "Coca-Cola"  on its bottles, some  sales that
ordinarily  go to  Coca-Cola  would  be diverted  to  others  free-
riding on Coca-Cola's mark.  This would make it less likely that
a successful firm like Coca-Cola would want to mark its prod-
ucts.  And without marks, blue-chip companies would be unable
to recover an investment in quality goods because  their items
would be hard to distinguish from cheap knockoffs.  A lack of
trademark protection would therefore reduce the incentive for
companies to pursue quality and leave consumers worse off.46
Infringement  law  recognizes  these  problems  by  offering
protection  against  concurrent  mark  uses  that  could  confuse
consumers.  As one might expect, infringement is the descen-
dant of the common law action for "passing off' goods as those
of another.47  Learned Hand once proclaimed that "[tihe law of
unfair trade comes  down very nearly to this-as judges have
repeated again and again-that one merchant shall not divert
customers from another by representing what he sells as ema-
nating from the second."48  Infringement  doctrine  thus holds
that "a trademark owner has a property right only insofar as is
necessary  to prevent consumer  confusion  as to who produced
the goods and to facilitate differentiation of the.., goods."49

156-59.20011 ONE AND INSEPARABLE 959
Thus, the core of every infringement suit is the likelihood
of consumer confusion.50  Under Judge Henry J. Friendly's for-
mulation  in  Polaroid Corp. v.  Polarad Electronics Corp.,51
courts typically consider eight factors to  determine whether a
likelihood of confusion exists in a given case: (1) the strength of
the senior mark; (2) the degree of similarity between the junior
and senior uses; (3) the proximity of the products; (4) the likeli-
hood that that the senior user will "bridge the gap"; (5) actual
confusion; (6) the defendant's good faith in adopting the mark;
(7) the quality of the defendant's product; and (8) the sophisti-
cation of the product's consumers.52
While  many  of these  factors  are  self-explanatory,  a few
merit additional discussion.53  The strength or distinctiveness
of a mark refers to its ability to identify a product as coming
from the mark owner.54  Marks  are classified in categories  of
increasing distinctiveness:  (1)  generic; (2)  descriptive; (3) sug-
gestive; (4) arbitrary; and (5) fanciful.55  The more distinctive a
mark, the more protection it usually receives.56  The proximity-
of-goods factor looks at how related the relevant products are.57
For example, the use of a similar  mark on pancake mix and
syrup is more likely to confuse  consumers than the use of the
same mark on pancake  mix and lumber.58  Finally, "bridging

portant element in the development of trademark infringement and dilution,
as is discussed in Parts IV and V.
54.  See, e.g., Brookfield Communications, Inc. v. West Coast Entm't Corp.,
174 F.3d 1036, 1058 (9th Cir. 1999).
55.  See Abercrombie & Fitch Co. v. Hunting World, Inc., 537 F.2d 4, 9 (2d
Cir. 1976) (Friendly, J.).  Fanciful, arbitrary, and suggestive marks are con-
sidered  "inherently  distinctive"  and  therefore  entitled  to  protection.  See

tion of Product Trade Dress Under Section 43(a) of the Lanham Act, 45 STAN.
L. REV. 2037, 2041 (1993).  Descriptive marks can obtain protection only if
they have acquired distinctiveness (also called secondary meaning) through
use in commerce.  See Two Pesos, Inc. v. Taco Cabana, Inc., 505 U.S. 763, 769
(1992).  The final category of marks-generic-receives no protection.  See id.
at 768.

in direct competition for an infringement action to succeed.

the gap" is a term of art that focuses on the probability that the
senior user will eventually enter into direct competition  with
the junior user.59
B.  DILUTION
The  second approach to  trademark protection is  dilution,
which is concerned with safeguarding the advertising power of
marks60  In a modern  economy, companies  often spend huge
sums on making their brand names attractive to the public.  As
Ralph S. Brown, Jr. once famously observed, a mark "is a nar-
row bridge over which all the traffic powered by [product]  ad-
vertising must pass ....  With time, the symbol comes  to be
more than a conduit through which the persuasive power of ad-
vertising is transmitted, and acquires a potency, a 'commercial
magnetism,'  of its own."61  So while a mark like Nike undoubt-
edly identifies  particular products,  Nike's extraordinary value
stems  from the commercial  power  that extensive  advertising
(helped along by a few athletes) gives to the mark.62
Supporters of dilution contend that marks deserve protec-
tion due to their persuasive ability to sell goods.63  As a result,
dilution theory posits that any concurrent  use of a mark that
can diminish its  advertising  power should be barred,  even if
59.  See, e.g., Nikon Inc. v. Ikon Corp., 987 F.2d 91, 95 (2d Cir. 1993).
60.  See, e.g., I.P. Lund Trading ApS v. Kohler Co.,  163 F.3d 27, 36 (1st
Cir. 1998).  Arguably, there is a third category of trademark protection.  Con-
gress has granted some  organizations  a monopoly--enforceable  by criminal
and civil penalties-over  their marks.  See San Francisco Arts & Athletics,
Inc. v. United States Olympic Comm., 483 U.S. 522,  532 n.8 (1987) (listing
statutes granting such rights to the American  National Red Cross, the 4-H
Club, Smokey Bear, Woodsy Owl, the Daughters of the American Revolution,
the Boy Scouts, the Girl Scouts, and Little League Baseball); Hughes, supra
note 31, at 971-72 (discussing the special protection given to cultural symbols).
61.  Brown, supra note 16, at 1187.
62.  As Justice Felix Frankfurter once explained,
If it is true that we live by symbols, it is no less true that we purchase
goods by them.  A trade-mark is a merchandising short-cut which in-
duces a purchaser to select what he wants, or what he has been led to
believe he wants.  The owner of a mark exploits this human propen-
sity by making every effort to impregnate the atmosphere of the mar-
ket with the drawing power of a congenial symbol.

(1942).
63.  See Bannon, supra note 10, at 90 (noting that dilution statutes protect
a mark's commercial value); Welkowitz, supra note 10, at 533 (explaining that
Schecter thought the real value protected by a trademark was its advertising
power).2001] ONE AND INSEPARABLE 961
that use could not confuse  consumers.64  Schechter  described
the  idea  before  a  congressional  committee:  "[Tlake  Rolls
Royce-for instance, if you allow Rolls Royce restaurants  and
Rolls Royce cafeterias, and Rolls Royce pants, and Rolls Royce
candy, in 10 years you will not have the Rolls Royce mark any
more."65  What Schechter meant was that even if people would
not confuse  Rolls Royce pants with Rolls Royce cars, a prolif-
eration  of Rolls Royce products  unaffiliated with the original
mark would  still  injure  the  mark's  advertising  magnetism.
Since dilution focuses on the marks themselves rather than on
consumers,  the concept is characterized  as more akin to tres-
pass than to consumer protection law.66
Until  recently,  dilution  was  a  creature  of  state  law.67
About  half of the states  have  enacted  dilution  statutes, and
most of those were patterned  on the Model  State Trademark
Act, which provides,
Likelihood of injury to business reputation or of dilution of the dis-
tinctive quality of a mark registered under this Act, or a mark valid
at common law, or a trade name valid at common law, shall be a
ground for injunctive relief notwithstanding the absence of competi-
tion between the parties or the absence of confusion as to the source
68
of goods or services.
To prevail in a state dilution action, mark owners usually need
to show (1)  that the mark is truly distinctive or has acquired
secondary meaning, and (2) that there exists a likelihood of di-
69
lution.
64.  See Bannon, supra note 10, at 92 (quoting Judge Learned Hand re-
garding the dangers of dilution); Schechter, supra note 1, at 831 (noting that
the selling power of a trademark is based on its uniqueness); Welkowitz, supra
note 10, at 533-34 (explaining that Schecter was critical of trademark protec-
tion limitations on non-competing goods).
65.  Hearings Held Before the House Comm. on Patents, 72d Cong.,  1st
Sess. 15 (1932) (statement of Frank I. Schechter).  Schechter's argument for
dilution is examined more closely in Part II.

Thus, one difference between dilution and infringement is
that dilution covers only a limited class of marks that possess
significant  inherent  distinctiveness  or  secondary  meaning,
while  infringement is a remedy available for all valid marks.
The distinctiveness requirement for dilution stems from the no-
tion that weak marks "are [already]  saturated and already di-
luted."70  Another way of putting this is that weak marks do not
possess much persuasive power  because  they are  either com-
prised of terms that are used on all sorts of products or are just
not recognized by many people.71  Weak  marks, therefore,  do
not ordinarily  merit dilution protection because  they are not
really worth copying.72
Two harms are identified as dilution under state law: "the
blurring of a mark's product identification or the tarnishment
of the affirmative  associations  a mark has come to  convey.73
Blurring  occurs  when  "the  defendant  uses  or  modifies  the
plaintiffs trademark to identify the defendant's goods and ser-
vices, raising the possibility that the mark will lose its ability
to serve as a unique identifier of the plaintiffs product."74  By
contrast, "'[tarnishment' generally arises when  the plaintiffs
trademark  is linked to products  of shoddy  quality, or is por-
trayed in an unwholesome or unsavory context likely to evoke
unflattering thoughts about the owner's product[s].7 5  Both  of
Massachusetts law).
70.  See Bannon, supra note 10, at 100.  Some have pushed for the elimi-
nation of the distinctiveness prong on the ground that weak marks are more
susceptible to dilution than strong marks.  See Welkowitz, supra note 10, at
540; infra text accompanying notes 166-67.
71.  There are marks comprised of generic terms that have acquired sec-
ondary meaning and become quite strong.  One example is General Motors,
which contains words used in many brand names, but still identifies an estab-
lished set of products.
72.  A direct competitor of a firm with a weak mark might still want to
copy the mark to injure that specific firm, but that kind of harm would nor-
mally be covered by infringement.

Mead Data Cent., Inc. v. Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A.,  Inc., 875 F.2d 1026, 1031
(2d Cir. 1989)).  Courts have been unable to reach a consensus on how to ana-
lyze blurring and tarnishment claims.  For more on the chaotic state of dilu-
tion doctrine, see Part II.D.2.

Jar" by a topless dance bar tarnished the mark of a savings and loan).  Tar-20011 ONE AND INSEPARABLE 963
these dilution harms, of course, are actionable only if the mark
is strong or distinctive.
Decades  of futile effort to enact a federal dilution remedy
ended with the passage of the FTDA in  the mid-1990s.76  The
FTDA defined dilution as "the lessening of the capacity of a fa-
mous  mark to  identify and distinguish  goods or services,  re-
gardless of the presence or absence of competition, likelihood of
confusion, mistake, or deception.'77  Although the statute's leg-
islative history is scanty,78 Congress apparently concluded that
a federal  dilution law was necessary because  "famous  marks
ordinarily are used on a nationwide basis and dilution protec-
tion is currently available on a patch-quilt system of protection,
in that only approximately twenty-five  states have laws that
prohibit trademark  dilution.'79  The FTDA  provides, in perti-
nent part, that "[t]he owner  of a famous mark shall be  enti-
tled,...  to an injunction against another person's commercial
use in commerce of a mark or trade name, if such use begins af-
ter the mark has become famous and causes dilution of the dis-
tinctive quality of the mark."80  This novel federal remedy was
enacted with overwhelming support.
Thus, the primary elements of a federal dilution claim are
(1) fame,  (2) commercial use, and (3) dilution.81  The fame re-
nishment can raise serious First Amendment questions by chilling commercial
speech or parodies of well-known marks.  See L.L. Bean, Inc. v. Drake Pub-
lishers,  Inc.,  811 F.2d 26,  33-34  (1st Cir.  1987)  (holding the Maine  anti-
dilution statute unconstitutional on this basis).  While these kinds of First
Amendment issues are worth exploring, this analysis strives to avoid constitu-
tional difficulties and focuses instead on tarnishment's role within the trade-
mark regime.
76.  Schechter led the first unsuccessful attempt to pass a federal dilution
law in 1932.  See Ringling Bros.-Barnum & Bailey Combined Shows, Inc. v.
Utah Div. of Travel Dev., 170 F.3d 449, 454 n.2 (4th Cir. 1999), cert. denied,
528 U.S. 923 (1999).  In 1988, a dilution provision passed the Senate but was
not taken up by the House of Representatives.  See I.P. Lund Trading ApS v.
Kohier Co., 163 F.3d 27, 46 & n.10 (1st Cir. 1998).
77.  15 U.S.C. § 1127 (Supp. IV 1999).
78.  The FTDA was passed without any hearings in the Senate and only a
few in the House. See 4 MCCARTHY, supra note 10, § 24:87.  Some courts have
relied on the more extensive legislative history of the unsuccessful 1988 dilu-
tion provision to interpret the FTDA.  See I.P. Lund, 163 F.3d at 46 & n.10.
Using legislative history from a bill that failed seven years prior to the FTDA's
enactment, however, is highly dubious.

quirement is analogous to the state law principle that a mark
must  be  particularly  distinctive  to  get  dilution  protection.82
The Second Circuit has held that the FTDA requires a mark to be distinctive
as well as famous to receive dilution protection.  Nabisco, Inc. v. PF Brands,
Inc., 191 F.3d 208, 215 (2d Cir. 1999).  This conclusion is based on language in
the statute indicating that only "famous and distinctive" marks are covered.
See id. (citing 15 U.S.C. § 1125(c)(1)).  One leading commentator argues that
the inclusion of a separate distinctiveness element in the FTDA was a drafting
error and is redundant given that the statute only protects famous marks. See
4 MCCARTHY, supra note 10, § 24:91.  That view, however, was expressly re-
jected by the Second Circuit. See Nabisco, 191 F.3d at 216 n.2.
The Second Circuit's construction is more consistent with the text of the
FTDA.  On the other hand, the court in Nabisco appears to have interpreted
distinctive to mean inherently distinctive.  The opinion provides examples  of
famous marks, such as American Airlines and Allied Stores, that are not in-
herently distinctive and hence would not be eligible for dilution relief. Id. at
227-28.  Both of these marks, however, have acquired distinctiveness (i.e., sec-
ondary meaning) through use in commerce and are distinctive in that sense.
Famous marks with secondary meaning may deserve less protection than fa-
mous and inherently distinctive marks, see Abercrombie & Fitch Co. v. Hunt-
ing World, Inc., 537 F.2d 4, 9 (2d Cir. 1976) (Friendly, J.), but Nabisco says
that famous marks without inherent  distinctiveness should get no dilution
protection at all, Nabisco, 191 F.3d at 219.
Nabisco does not explain why the term "distinctive" in the FTDA ought to
be construed as encompassing only inherently distinctive  marks.  The con-
struction is particularly odd given that the statute's fame prong refers explic-
itly to "inherent or acquired distinctiveness."  15 U.S.C. § 1125(c)(1)(A).  Inter-
preting distinctive to include acquired and inherent distinctiveness, however,
would render the term distinctive in the statute meaningless,  since a mark
cannot be famous without having at least some acquired distinctiveness.  Per-
haps the phrase "famous and distinctive" should be read as a single term of
art-whether the product of a drafting error or not-rather than as establish-
ing separate fame and distinctiveness elements.  See Times Mirror Magazines,
Inc. v. Las Vegas Sports News, L.L.C., 212 F.3d 157, 166-67 (3rd Cir. 2000),
cert. denied, No. 00-470, 2001 WL 12465 (Jan. 8, 2001).
82.  The FTDA states,
In determining whether a mark is distinctive  and famous,  a court
may consider factors such as, but not limited to-
(A) the degree of inherent or acquired distinctiveness of the mark;
(B) the duration and extent of use of the mark in connection with the
goods or services with which the mark is used;
(C) the duration and extent of advertising and publicity of the mark;
(D) the geographical extent of the trading area in which the mark is
used;
(E)t he channels  of trade for the goods  or services with which the
mark is used;
(F) the degree of recognition  of the mark in the trading areas and
channels of trade used by the marks' owner and the person against
whom the injunction is sought;
(G) the nature and extent of use of the same or similar marks by third
parties; and
(H) whether  the mark was  registered under the  [trademark  stat-
utes]....2001] ONE AND INSEPARABLE 965
Commercial  use  of a mark is necessary  to provide  a federal
nexus,  under the  Commerce  Clause, for  a dilution remedy.83
Finally,  as  for the  dilution  component  itself, the  FTDA has
been read to incorporate the blurring and tarnishment theories
without being limited to the state law paradigms.84
C.  CONFLICT BETWEEN THE TRADEMARK MODELS
While  infringement  and  dilution  both  aspire  to  protect
trademarks, they obviously take a quite different view of why
marks are worth protecting.  In the eyes of infringement law,
marks grant owners a limited property right to help consumers
distinguish goods.  Infringement supporters acknowledge  that
marks  have  persuasive  power,  and  concede  that  protecting
marks for the benefit of consumers  may indirectly protect ad-
vertising magnetism.85 They contend, however, that safeguard-
ing persuasive power itself should not be a goal of trademark
doctrine  because  that would  grant mark  owners  an  unwar-
ranted monopoly.86  Dilution, of course, takes the opposite tack.
Its advocates assert that marks  are worth protecting because
their owners have gone to great lengths to make them commer-
cially attractive,  and that the resulting benefits to  consumers
87
are incidental.
What makes the joust between infringement and dilution
more than an ordinary doctrinal dispute is that the only stable
equilibrium between the two models lies in the triumph of one
over the other.  Although dilution is often described as starting
where the likelihood of confusion test leaves off, it is more accu-
15 U.S.C. § 1125(c)(1).
Before determining what marks should get dilution protection, we need to
understand what dilution means.  It should be said, however, that as a practi-
cal matter the fame or distinctiveness determination in dilution cases has al-
most always turned on whether the mark at issue needed transitional protec-
tion due to infringement obsolescence.  This highly pragmatic view of what is a
famous mark has been carried over into the FTDA, which permits courts to
examine a wide range of evidence in making a fame determination.

rate to say that infringement follows a fortiori from dilution.88
While dilution theory posits that there are many uses of a mark
that harm its persuasive power without risking consumer con-
fusion, there is little doubt that "if a consumer mistakenly be-
lieves  that  Company  B's  goods  are  made,  sponsored,  or  ap-
proved  by  Company A,  then to  the  confused  consumer,  the
value of Company A's  mark with respect to that consumer is
[diluted]. "89  It is almost impossible to think of any infringe-
ment situation that would not be covered by dilution.
This  raises  the  following  question:  why  do  we  need  in-
fringement for the marks covered by dilution?90  Since dilution
doctrine  encompasses  all  possible  infringement  cases,  in-
fringement starts to look as useless as the human appendix.91
Accordingly,  the leading  modern  critic  of dilution, Robert  N.
Klieger, believes that "ilt may just be a matter of time before
dilution  eclipses  confusion  as  the  gravaman  of most federal
88.  See, e.g., Nabisco Brands, Inc. v. PF Brands, Inc.,  191 F.3d 208, 219
(2d Cir. 1999) ("Consumer confusion would undoubtedly dilute the distinctive
selling power of a trademark."); James Burrough, Ltd. v. Sign of Beefeater,
Inc., 540 F.2d 266, 274 n.16 (7th Cir. 1976) (stating that dilution necessarily
follows from consumer confusion); Klieger, supra note 9, at 812 (stating that
"[an] antidilution statute, read literally, render[s] the consumer confusion test
immaterial").
Supporters  of dilution strenuously object to the argument that dilution
necessarily follows from confusion.  They maintain that dilution and infringe-
ment are different theories "positing a different kind of damage to a mark
caused by a different form of consumer conception."  4 MCCARTHY, supra note
10, § 24:71.  That analysis is conceptually flawed and has been uniformly re-
jected by the case law.  See, e.g., Ringling Bros.-Barnum & Bailey Combined
Shows, Inc. v. Celozzi-Ettelson  Chevrolet, Inc., 855 F.2d 480, 484 (7th Cir.
1988).  Moreover, no court has ever found a likelihood of consumer confusion
and then not also found dilution for a mark that was eligible for dilution pro-
tection.

90.  See, e.g., RESTATEMENT, supra note 17, § 25 cmt. b; Welkowitz, supra
note 10, at 546 ("Courts have expressed reservations that a stringent applica-

and unfair  competition...  .");  Note, supra note 10,  at 529  (stating that a
proper dilution remedy would allow courts to dispense with most infringement
and unfair competition doctrine).
91.  One way to mitigate the conflict between infringement and dilution
would be to make infringement the sole remedy for disputes between competi-
tors, while confining dilution to claims involving non-competing goods.  See
Pro-Phy-Lac-Tic Brush Co. v. Jordan Marsh Co.,  165 F.2d 549, 553 (1st Cir.
1948).  This idea, however, has never gained any support. E.g., Nabisco, 191

trademark actions  and trademark rights in gross displace con-
sumer  protection  as  the  defining  feature  of  United  States
trademark law."92  Infringement backers like Klieger basically
have one response to this doomsday scenario: dilution must be
93
destroyed.
Maybe the situation is not so dire.  After all,  dilution is
only available for famous or quite distinctive marks.  So in the-
ory,  a  zero-sum  struggle  between  the  trademark  protection
models involves  only some marks.94  The  difficulty  with this
easy answer  is that courts have been quite willing to declare
many weak marks famous or distinctive enough to come within
dilution's grasp.95  Some examples include the following: (1)  the
"Candy Land" board game; (2) the Maryland "Gazette" newspa-
per chain; (3) 'awa"  convenience stores; and (4) 'edgewood"
homes.96  The breadth of the marks in this clutch of cases does
not engender  confidence  in  the  ability of the distinctiveness
element  to  ease  the  conflict  between  dilution  and  infringe-
ment.97  Moreover, some courts have extended dilution protec-
tion without making a fame or distinctiveness finding at all.98
Even if the restriction of dilution to a subset of marks is
meaningful,  however,  the  Darwinian  struggle  between  in-
fringement  and  dilution remains  an  issue for  a  substantial
number of marks.
Besides,  a narrow reading  of what  constitutes  a famous
mark is really just another way for infringement advocates  to
wipe out dilution.  As  discussed in Part II.C,  strong (i.e.,  fa-

mous) marks  are  already protected  from virtually all concur-
rent uses by infringement  doctrine, and therefore  dilution ex-
tends no additional protection unless the definition of fame is
construed  liberally.99  By  urging  a  narrow  interpretation  of
fame,  infringement  backers  were  essentially trying to  render
dilution law superfluous.
Failing in their effort to prevent the enactment  of dilution
statutes, pro-infringement  forces  retreated to  the  courts  and
pleaded for dilution to be read as narrowly as possible.1l°  Many
judges obliged by employing quite creative (or strained) inter-
pretations  of dilution laws.101  Some imposed  a likelihood  of
consumer confusion requirement on dilution plaintiffs in spite
of explicit statutory language to the contrary.102  Others added
an extra element to dilution by holding that defendants  must
have had a predatory intent for a dilution action to succeed.103
The Fourth and Fifth Circuits have recently tried another ap-
proach by construing the FTDA to require proof of actual dilu-
tion, even though "concededly  [this]  is a stringent interpreta-
tion  of 'dilution'  in the  Federal Act."1°4  Dilution  supporters

The two trademark models  appear headed for a wrestling

view, dilution will either supersede infringement or courts will
save infringement by interpreting  dilution in a highly restric-
tive fashion.  To avoid this harsh choice,  we must reconstruct
the relationship between infringement and dilution.
II. ON THE ORIGIN OF DILUTION
This  Part sifts through Schechter's  original argument for
dilution in the pages  of the Harvard Law Review.107  In re-
sponse to the change of marks into quality indicators by the In-
dustrial  Revolution,  Schechter  contended  that the  consumer
confusion model of trademark protection should be abandoned.
His rationale for dilution has not only been heavily criticized by
commentators,  but it  fails to explain many aspects of modern
dilution doctrine.  Meeting both of these challenges requires us
to discard Schechter's explanation and re-imagine his proposal
as a remedy for infringement obsolescence.
A.  FROM SOURCE TO QUALITY
Before Schechter achieved fame through dilution, he made
a critical  contribution  to trademark  law by pointing out the
transformation  of marks from  source  identifiers  into  quality
symbols.08  Marks got their start as a requirement imposed by
medieval  guilds  and towns  to identify smuggled goods, which
would not have an approved mark, and the producers of shoddy
goods,  who would  be  subject to  discipline.09  To understand
how the development of a modern economy changed  the func-
tion  of marks  and  spurred  Schechter  to  invent  dilution, we
must start by examining how people shopped in olden days.

1.  Horse-and-Buggy Commerce
During  the  pre-industrial  era,  consumers  bought  goods
mainly  from local  producers  that were  well  known  to  them.
This mode of consumption evolved because transportation was
quite limited, and local  craftsmen possessed  a significant ad-
vantage  over  their  more  distant  competitors.  These  local
manufacturers were also generally small and sold only one type
of good.110  Remember that the modem corporation  capable of
organizing large-scale production for different items only began
to emerge  in the late nineteenth  century.  To illustrate how
these commercial  realities  shaped trademark  doctrine, let us
call the paradigmatic  mark owner  during this period  "Spark
the Blacksmith."
Under an agrarian economic regime, Spark's mark identi-
fied the source of his goods.111  In other words, when customers
went to a store to look for small manufactured items, they dis-
tinguished  Spark's  horseshoes  or nails  from  those  made  by
other blacksmiths by finding his mark.112  The recognition that
products  were  forged  by  Spark was  significant  because  con-
sumers knew who Spark was and were therefore  aware of his
particular reputation for producing quality goods.  By marking
his  items,  Spark  "maintained  the  identity  of  [his]  product
through the hands of the middleman" and preserved  a direct
link with his customers.' 13
The  predominance  of mom-and-pop  production, however,
meant that marks could serve only a limited role in commercial
life.  Outside the local area, Spark's mark would not say any-
thing about the source of the marked goods.  This was because
nobody would have heard of Spark, not to mention that other
blacksmiths  named  Spark-with  different  reputations-
probably worked  elsewhere.  Furthermore, the use  of Spark's
110.  See Kieger, supra note  9, at 796; Schechter, supra note  1,  at 814.
This is not to say that there were no widely-known brand names at that time.
In particular, certain luxury items like porcelain or jewels may well have been
made by well-known craft firms.  This constituted, however, only a small por-
tion of commercial activity.
111.  See, e.g., Brown, supra note 16, at 1185-87; Klieger, supra note 9, at
797-98.
112.  Of course,  many local producers sold their goods themselves rather
than relying on a merchant.  If Spark owned a store at his forge, then his
mark-via a storefront sign-would indicate the retail location of his products.
For more on the location-identifying function of marks, see infra Part VIA.

TRADEMARK REP. 551, 552 (1969).20011 ONE AND INSEPARABLE
mark by producers  of other kinds of items would not create  a
problem.  Everyone who was aware of Spark's reputation knew
that Spark was a blacksmith and not a butcher or a candlestick
maker.  Accordingly, nobody could be misled into thinking that
goods  marked  "Spark" were  made  by  Spark  the Blacksmith
unless those products were of a type ordinarily forged by black-
smiths.
The  common law  of unfair  competition  eventually  devel-
oped  the  consumer  confusion  test  to  protect  the  source-
identifying function of marks. 14  Due to the relatively minor
part marks played in trade, the scope of confusion doctrine was
restricted in two major ways.  First, a mark was shielded only
"where [the]  mark ha[d]  significance-that is, only in the geo-
graphic market that it actually serve[d]."115  Thus, Spark could
not stop manufacturers  in other communities  from using his
mark unless he could make the unlikely showing that his mark
was actually  recognized there." 6  Second,  infringement  relief
was available only when the senior and junior users were direct
competitors. 17  Based on the assumption that each producer fo-
cused  on a known  and limited set of goods,  the common law
was clear:  "If  [the mark owner]  does  not carry on a trade in
iron, but carries  on a trade in linen and stamps  a lion on his
linen, another person may stamp a lion on iron."118  This nar-
row zone of protection for marks fit the commercial needs of the
time.
2.  A Mechanical Age
The pastoral world of the town craftsman was but a distant
memory by the dawn of the twentieth century.  Due to sweep-
ing advances  in transportation  and production methods,  con-
sumers bought fewer goods  from local  manufacturers. 19  In-
114.  Before the likelihood of confusion test emerged, an action for trade-
mark deceit would only lie if there was an actual diversion of sales from the
senior user to the junior user. See, e.g., Schechter, supra note 1, at 821.

stead, shoppers counted on corporations that used economies of
scale to provide cheaper goods with more variety than ever be-
fore.  This new consumption pattern radically altered the rela-
tionship between customers  and producers.  While a local en-
trepreneur  like Spark was well known by his customers,  they
knew little  about the corporate behemoths that now supplied
their needs.120  Moreover, these firms were often conglomerates
that produced many types of unrelated goods; an achievement
well beyond the capabilities of a typical small business.121
This  structural  upheaval reshaped  the economy  and fun-
damentally altered the mark's source-identifying function.  Al-
though marks continued to designate the source of goods, that
information was now worthless because corporate sources were
basically anonymous. 22  Shoppers do not usually know or care
whether a certain kind of shampoo is made by Johnson & John-
son or Proctor & Gamble.  They buy the shampoo because they
think that the brand name-as distinct from the source-has a
good  reputation.123  But if consumers  no  longer  knew  much
about the sources of their goods, then how did marks still serve
a useful purpose?
Schechter  answered  that  question  by  recognizing  that
marks had become important as abstract symbols of consistent
quality.124  Imagine  that the descendants  of Spark decided to

safely take it for granted that not one in a thousand knowing of or desiring to
purchase 'Baker's Cocoa' or 'Baker's Chocolate' know of Walter Baker & Co.,
Limited.").

Judge Learned  Hand was  one of the first to  recognize the  change in the

that [the mark owner] should be known as the maker; on the contrary, it will
suffice if the article be known as coming from a single, though anonymous,
source."  Coty, Inc. v. LeBlume Import Co., 292 F. 264, 267-68 (S.D.N.Y. 1923),

modern economy also act as product identifiers (i.e., the product's name), but
this adds little to trademark analysis.  Distinctions between product lines (as
opposed to brand names) involve only direct competitors, and therefore settled
infringement doctrine should be able to address issues arising from potential
product confusion.

set up a company that produced tools,  home accessories,  and
clothing with the Spark mark.  Whereas "Spark" once evoked a
known person in a single trade, the mark now told consumers
that the product was made by the same anonymous source that
supplied other goods with the Spark mark.  In other words, a
mark "assure[d] the public that the goods purchased today will
be  the same  as  the goods bearing  the same  trademark  that
were  purchased yesterday."125  By providing  this consistency
guarantee, marks gave consumers confidence  that Spark prod-
ucts would be similar in quality (good or bad) to previous items
wearing the Spark label.
Even though  marks  created  a  consistent  quality  bench-
mark,  consumers  still  had  to  gauge  the  reputation  behind
"Spark" to  take  advantage  of the  consistency that the  mark
represented.  Rather than utilizing local knowledge  as in the
past, consumers now relied on advertising and on their own ex-
perience  with Spark products  to figure out what could be ex-
pected from items with that mark.  No matter how shoppers
formed their quality expectations,  the key was that the mark
ensured  that  those  impressions-whether  well  informed  or
not-matched  what appeared  on the shelves.  Marks had be-
come commercial vessels designed "to identify a product as sat-
isfactory  and  thereby  to  stimulate  further  purchases  by  the
consuming public."126
The evolution of marks from source identifiers into quality
indicators  meant  that  "[t]he  assumptions  upon  which  nine-
teenth century  trademark law were built did not match early
twentieth century trade realities."127  In particular, the limita-
tion of infringement protection to junior uses by direct competi-
tors no longer made much sense.  Under the regime of Spark
the Blacksmith, consumers knew what kinds of things the local
sources  of their goods made.  Marks therefore represented  a
reputation  for  quality that was  limited to  certain  classes  of
goods and could  not easily be  appropriated by other kinds of
producers.

In the  brave  new  industrial  world,  however,  consumers
were well aware that a mark could show up on unrelated prod-
ucts  coming from  the  same  source.128  Marks  represented  a
general reputation for quality that might be applied to many
goods.129  As a result, stamping a mark on items unrelated to
those made by the mark owner could mislead  consumers  into
thinking that the junior user's  goods were  up to the quality
standard symbolized by the mark.130  Put another way, junior
uses  of a mark, even  by non-competitors,  could  substantially
impair  the  quality-representing  function  by  undermining  a
mark's consistency.
3.  Trademark Law Lags
The sweeping changes ushered in by the Industrial Revolu-
tion were not matched by an equivalent leap in trademark doc-
trine.  Well into this century, infringement had a tin ear when
it came to the need for a new approach that would maintain the
vitality of the mark's quality function.131  For instance, many
courts stubbornly adhered to the view that consumer confusion
was not possible when the junior and senior users were in dif-
ferent  trades.132  Stirrings  of reform  were  evident  here  and
there, but as can sometimes  be the case with the common law,
these adjustments to longstanding doctrine were halting, fact-
bound, and took a great deal of time.133
Much of Schechter's scholarly work poured withering scorn
on the "failure of the courts to keep pace with the necessities of
trade and the functional development  of trademarks.' 34  His
initial  solution to the obsolescence  problem was simply to ex-
pand the definition of consumer confusion.  In his 1925 treatise,
The  Historical Foundations of the  Law  Relating to  Trade-
Marks, Schechter  argued  that courts  should acknowledge  the
impotence of source theory and celebrate the rise of the mark's

confusion test to protect that function.136
B.  THE RATIONAL BASIS OF TRADEMARK PROTECTION
Schechter was not a patient man.  Just two years after his
treatise was published, he wrote The Rational Basis of Trade-
mark Protection, which concluded that the consumer confusion
model was hopelessly obsolete and should be replaced by dilu-
tion.137  Schechter  described  the modern trademark in  poetic
terms:
The signboard of an inn in stage-coach days, when the golden lion or
the green cockatoo actually symbolized to the hungry and weary trav-
eler a definite smiling host, a tasty meal from a particular cook, a fa-
vorite brew and a comfortable bed, was merely "the visible manifesta-
tion" of the good will or probability of custom of the house; but today
the trademark is not merely the symbol of good will but often the
most effective agent for the creation of good will, imprinting upon the
public mind an anonymous and impersonal guaranty of satisfaction,
138
creating a desire for further satisfactions.
After reiterating  that marks  were  now primarily quality
indicators  rather than  source  identifiers,  Schechter  launched
yet  another  attack  on the limited protection  provided  by in-
fringement doctrine.  He argued that a mark owner "should be
allowed the broadest scope possible for 'the natural expansion
of his trade' to other lines or fields of enterprise."139  In addi-
tion, he pointed out that "[t]he  use of similar marks  on non-
competing goods is perhaps the normal rather than the excep-
140
tional case of infringement."
The difference between Schechter's treatise and his subse-
quent article was that the latter argued that courts should fo-
cus on protecting the persuasive power given to marks by the
135.  See Ringling Bros.-Barnum & Bailey Combined Shows, Inc. v. Utah

33. Although Schechter never actually used the word "dilution" to describe his
proposal, he relied on several German dilution cases and thus his article has
been construed as the genesis of dilution in American law.

quality function and advertising.' 41  As Schechter said, "To de-
scribe  a trademark  merely  as  a symbol of good will, without
recognizing  in it  an agency  for the actual  creation  and  per-
petuation of good will, ignores the most potent aspect of the na-
ture  of a trademark  and that phase  most in need of protec-
tion."142  He believed that by protecting investments in a mark's
commercial  magnetism  "to the same extent as  plant machin-
ery," marks would get the optimal level of protection  that in-
fringement  was  unable to  provide.143  In other  words,  while
Schechter's treatise argued that the definition of consumer con-
fusion was obsolete, his article contended that infringement it-
self was obsolete.
Based  on  this  new  approach  to  trademark  protection,
Schechter redefined  the relevant injury  as "the gradual whit-
tling away or dispersion of the identity and hold upon the pub-
lic mind of the mark or name by its use upon non-competing
goods," which is now called dilution by blurring. 144 He observed
that it was self-evident that "the more distinctive the mark, the
greater its selling power."145  A junior use was therefore harm-
ful  because  it  diminished  the source  of a mark's  advertising
power: its "arresting uniqueness." 46  Furthermore, "[t]he more
distinctive or unique the mark, the deeper is its impress upon
the public consciousness, and the greater its need for protection
against vitiation or dissociation from the particular product in
connection with which it has been used."147
In essence, Schechter was articulating a classic commons
problem long before that concept was invented.148  While a sin-
gle junior use of a valuable resource (i.e., the persuasiveness of
a distinctive mark) might well be innocuous, in the aggregate
those uses could whittle away and destroy the resource unless
they are  adequately regulated.  Marks  are susceptible to this
kind of exploitation  because  a mark owner  cannot  physically

bar someone from using their mark.  While non-excludability is
a feature of all marks,  Schechter  focused  his proto-commons
analysis  on  strong marks because  they were  presumably the
ones that many other firms would want to copy.149  Seen in this
light,  dilution was  a  remedy  designed  to  combat  a  looming
commons tragedy by giving mark owners more power to protect
their resource.
Even though Schechter advocated dilution as the best way
to protect the  new mark, he conceded  that the common law
might accomplish the same goal by adapting the consumer con-
fusion test.  Right after propounding his "whittling" definition
of dilution, he stated that "as in so many other phases of legal
history the courts may arrive at this result by indirection, i.e.,
by the distinction which..,  is gradually...  being drawn be-
tween common or semi-descriptive marks or names on the one
hand, and arbitrary or fanciful  trademarks or tradenames  on
the other."150  Even in the 1920s, arbitrary and fanciful marks
were  starting  to  get  broader  protection,  and  Schechter  ap-
plauded this initial effort to bring infringement into the mod-
em age.151
Nonetheless, Schechter's enthusiasm for dilution remained
undiminished.  As he summarized his position,
[Tihe following principles necessarily emerge: (1) that the value of the
modern trademark lies in its selling power; (2) that this selling power
depends for its psychological hold upon the public, not merely upon
the merit of the goods upon which it is used, but equally upon its own
uniqueness or singularity; (3) that such uniqueness or singularity is
vitiated or impaired by its use upon  either related or non-related
goods; and (4) that the degree of its protection depends in turn upon
the extent to which, through the efforts or ingenuity of its owner[s], it
is actually unique and different from other marks.'52
Seventy  years later, these words  are  still rattling trademark
law.
C.  THE SCHECHTER DILUTION FORMULA CRITICIZED
While  Schechter's  recognition  of  the  quality-identifying
function of marks has been widely accepted,  his rationale for
dilution remains controversial.  Critics have identified four ma-
jor problems with his proposal.  First, they say there is no pub-
149.  See Carter, supra note 33, at 762.
150.  Schechter, supra note 1, at 826.
151.  See id. at 826-28.
152.  Id. at 830-31.978 MINNESOTA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 85:949
lic purpose served by protecting the persuasive power of marks.
Second, dilution may run afoul of constitutional limitations on
intellectual property protection.  Third, it is far from clear that
numerous  non-confusing  uses  of a strong  mark  diminish its
selling power.  Fourth, infringement protection for the marks
Schechter was worried  about has expanded so much since the
1920s that dilution has become unnecessary.
Schechter was correct when he observed that marks  pos-
sessed persuasive power, but he never explained  what public
policy  was  furthered  by  protecting  persuasiveness.  His
opaqueness on this important question requires us to make an
argument for him.153  Ordinarily, American law does not grant
property rights merely because a putative owner has invested
significant resources in creating something.  Unless Schechter's
formula is understood as  establishing a kind of natural prop-
erty right for mark owners,154 protecting the commercial  mag-
153.  If marks have a persuasive function, and trademark law is geared to-
wards preventing mark functions from being substantially impaired, then why
should persuasiveness go unprotected?  The answer is that trademark doctrine
already protects the commercial magnetism of marks indirectly.  See Klieger,
supra note 9, at 861-62.  As framed by Schechter, however, dilution argues
that persuasiveness should receive additional protection and become the focal
point of trademark analysis.  We therefore need to determine if there is any
reason to follow this prescription. See id. at 862.
154.  A sophisticated argument defending dilution partly on natural rights
grounds has been made recently by Kristine Boylan.  See Boylan, supra note
20, at 18-21.  Boylan contends that Schechter's proposal should be construed
as embodying a Lockean labor theory of property.  See id. at 18-26.  She also
suggests that an appropriate analogy for dilution is the common law right of
publicity, which gives celebrities control over the use of their personas in ad-
vertising.  See, e.g.,  Onassis v. Christian Dior-New York, Inc., 472 N.Y.S.2d
254, 263 (Sup. Ct. 1984); Boylan, supra note 20, at 28.  Just as famous person-
alities have a property right in themselves, Boylan says, dilution can be un-
derstood as giving famous corporations a property right in their corporate per-
sonas.  Boylan, supra note 20, at 31.
There are two major problems with this analysis.  First, a natural rights
theory of dilution is inconsistent with the utilitarian justifications that sup-
port property rights elsewhere in the law.  Second, the analogy between dilu-
tion and the right of publicity does not work well.  A right of publicity is usu-
ally justified on two grounds. First, Prosser argued that the common-law right
of privacy gives celebrities an inherent right to profit from their own likeness.
See William L. Prosser, Privacy, 48 CAL. L. REV. 383, 389 (1960).  This obvi-
ously does not carry over well into the corporate context.  Second, some have
argued that famous celebrities need protection because their personalities are
valuable social resources that face commons depletion.  See generally Mark F.
Grady, A Positive Economic Theory of the Right of Publicity, 1 UCLA ENT. L.
REV. 97 (1994) (arguing that the right of publicity is needed in order to ensure
that publicity assets are not wasted through exploitation).  As we saw earlier,
Schechter's original proposal was based on a similar commons rationale.  See2001] ONE AND INSEPARABLE
netism  of marks  can be justified only if that generates  some
sort of social benefit.155
Figuring  out whether  Schechter's  argument  for  dilution
fosters social value necessitates some discussion of how trade-
mark law differs from its intellectual property cousins of copy-
right and patent.  Those two legal regimes give exclusive con-
trol to authors  and inventors  for many years, and then their
creations enter the public domain.156  This enables the public to
utilize intellectual property while giving creators  an incentive
to innovate.  Trademark infringement law, on the other hand,
supra text accompanying notes 148-50.  The subsequent discussion demon-
strates, however, that no social benefit comes from safeguarding the persua-
siveness of marks beyond the protection already provided by infringement doc-
trine.
Boylan's approach boils down to an argument that dilution constitutes
"unjust enrichment" and therefore must be stopped.  See Boylan, supra note
20, at 28. But this does not get us very far. Under Boylan's theory, dilution is
unjust mainly because the mark owner has a Lockean property right. Without
this natural rights premise-for which there is no support-Boylan's position
basically collapses.
155.  Some other theories offered by dilution supporters can be quickly dis-
missed.  Bannon argues that without dilution junior users would obtain an un-
justified "naked license."  Bannon, supra note 10, at 109.  This refers to the
traditional view that marks cannot be licensed to other firms unless there is
some assurance that the licensee will produce goods similar in quality to the
mark owner.  Id. at 79-80.  Unfortunately, Bannon does not explain why ordi-
nary infringement doctrine fails to address the "naked license" problem.  Jun-
ior uses falling outside the reach of consumer confusion are so tenuously con-
nected  to  the associations  created  by a mark that they  cannot really be
characterized as licenses at all.
Another rationale for dilution is that it prevents "genericide."  This doc-
trine describes the revocation of trademark rights once a mark becomes the
commonly used term for a type of good rather than just a brand name. See
Welkowitz, supra note 10, at 558-59; see, e.g., Kellogg Co. v. Nat'l Biscuit Co.,
305 U.S. 111, 116 (1938) (finding "Shredded Wheat" to be generic); Bayer Co.
v. United Drug Co., 272 F. 505, 510-11 (S.D.N.Y. 1921) (finding "Aspirin" ge-
neric).  By preventing the common use of a strong mark, dilution halts generi-
cide in its tracks.
There is, however, no particular reason to think that genericide ought to
be prevented.  If the phenomenon occurred frequently, then an argument could
be made that the resulting disruption to trademark rights requires a remedy.
Genericide, however, is a rare event.  The doctrine revokes the rights of very
few mark owners, but in so doing avoids giving protection to marks that have
become synonymous with the product itself. See Nabisco, Inc. v. PF Brands,
Inc., 191 F.3d 208, 215 (2d Cir. 1999) (discussing generic marks). This strikes
a sensible balance between public and private rights, and hence using dilution
to protect those few senior users who may lose their investments due to gen-
ericide would be inappropriate.
156.  See, e.g., Klieger, supra note 9, at 864-65 (comparing inventors rights
in patent, copyright, and trademark law).980 MINNESOTA LAW REVIEW [Vol.  85:949
has traditionally struck a different balance.  While mark own-
ers  do  not  get  exclusive  control  over  their  "property,"  their
rights last as long as the mark continues to designate a particu-
lar source in commerce.157
Although  infringement  theory  acknowledges  that  senior
users  need  some  incentive  to  mark  their  goods,  once  that
threshold is crossed there are no additional benefits reaped by
giving stronger incentives  for mark owners  to create  new or
better marks. As Stephen L. Carter explains,
[T]rademark  law may be described as indifferent to the creation of
marks, in the sense that the number of marks makes no difference.
One might conceive of an optimal supply of copyrighted works or pat-
ented inventions, but it makes no sense to refer to an optimal supply
of marks as such. All that is needed is a different mark for each pro-
ducer.151
An increased number  of copyrights  and patents may gen-
erate social value, but more (or more clever) trademarks do no
such thing.  Simply put, this is because marks do not actually
affect the quality of goods and services.159  In the end, protect-
ing persuasiveness  only encourages companies  to invest more
157.  See, e.g., Landes & Posner, supra note 45, at 287 (stating that trade-
marks are tied to distinct physical property).
158.  Id.
159.  Product designs may constitute an exception.  See Ralph S. Brown,
Design Protection:A  n Overview, 34 UCLA L. Rev. 1341, 1403 (1987) (arguing
for short-term design protection).  After all, a pleasing product design might
well add value to certain products.  In a few trade dress cases, courts have
employed the language of dilution to expand protection for product designs.
See, e.g., Esercizio v. Roberts, 944 F.2d 1235, 1245 (6th Cir. 1991); see also id.
at 1250-51 (Kennedy, J., dissenting).  Some commentators have argued that
this is appropriate because design patents do not provide enough incentives
for designers.  See Daniel J. Gifford, The Interplay of Product Definition, De-
sign and Trade Dress, 75 MINN. L. REV. 769, 779-92 (1991).  Others contend
that the indirect protection of designs through trademark law is wrong and
that the answer lies in a new design patent statute.  See Gleiberman, supra
note 55, at 2070-71.
This debate repeats a theme that runs throughout this Article: namely,
that dilution is best conceived as an obsolescence remedy.  To the extent that
dilution fixes obsolete design patent law, that role might be appropriate in an
abstract sense.  The practical interaction of dilution with design patents, how-
ever, basically renders the question moot.  Product designs (as opposed to or-
dinary marks or labels) only run in a particular line of goods (i.e, the Cadillac
tail fin does not get put on sofas).  Trade dress claims involving designs are
therefore likely to occur only between direct competitors, where infringement
protection is at its zenith. Accordingly, dilution will almost never extend more
protection to strong product designs than infringement already provides.  See
infra text accompanying notes 165-67.20011 ONE AND INSEPARABLE
in marks without leading to any clear public benefit.160  Thus,
the argument for giving persuasiveness special protection fails.
Next, there are constitutional pitfalls presented by Schech-
ter's dilution formula.  Pursuant to Article One, Section Eight,
Congress  can grant protection to patents  and copyrights  only
"for limited Times."161  As was noted earlier, trademark rights
have  an unlimited duration  as long as the mark identifies  a
particular  source.  Therefore,  if Schechter's  remedy  creates
property rights for marks that approximate copyrights and pat-
ents, there  are  serious  questions  as to whether  dilution  can
survive constitutional scrutiny.  Both the First and Fourth Cir-
cuits have  alluded to this concern while  narrowly construing
the FTDA.162  Interpretive techniques can massage this issue,
but the constitutional problems raised by Schechter's rationale
just point out another weakness in his approach.
Even if there was a good reason to protect the commercial
magnetism  of marks  that  could  pass  constitutional  muster,
there is no evidence that a blizzard of non-confusing uses actu-
ally dilutes a mark's advertising power. 63  Essentially, Schech-
ter's proposal "suffers from  a critical defect of a priori reason-
ing.  He assumes that marks in fact are diluted and that this
dilution can occur in the absence of confusion."164  It is difficult
to imagine, as Schechter assumed, that consumers will respond
less readily to a strong mark like Kodak if some non-confusing,
and hence marginal, junior uses exist in the marketplace.  One
could just as easily argue that those junior references are like
literary allusions, which tend to reinforce rather than diminish
160.  Moreover, protecting mark persuasiveness may have significant anti-
competitive effects by erecting barriers to entry in a variety of markets.  For a
detailed discussion, see Klieger, supra note 9, at 862-63.

Discoveries").

Cir. 1998); id. at 51 (Boudin, J., concurring).
163.  This line of attack is somewhat unfair. When Schechter was writing,
the range of non-confusing uses was much greater than it is today precisely
because of the infringement obsolescence that he was trying to correct.  As a
result, it was much easier for Schechter to assume that non-confusing uses
would dilute marks.  Nevertheless,  evaluating his dilution proposal requires
us to look at the law in the here and now.
164.  Welkowitz, supra note 10, at 538 (emphasis added).982 MINNESOTA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 85:949
than  diminish the  power  of the  original  source.  Schechter
never provided any evidence to support his view of the corrosive
impact of non-confusing uses, and none of his acolytes have ei-
ther.165  Moreover,  Schechter  may well  have  focused  on  the
wrong kinds of marks.  If anything, weak marks struggling to
establish their commercial identities would seem more vulner-
able to being overwhelmed by multiple junior uses than strong
marks.166  As a matter of fact, some dilution supporters  have
argued that weak marks should be covered by the remedy not-
withstanding Schechter's position. 167
Finally, even if there were sound policy and constitutional
justifications for dilution, the doctrine's critics contend that in-
fringement protection  for famous marks is now so broad that
dilution has  been rendered  superfluous.168  Schechter's  intui-
tion  that the common  law  might  someday expand  consumer
confusion to deal with his concerns has come to pass.  As one
commentator describes the current state of the law, the judici-
ary's  "increased willingness to find an actionable likelihood of
confusion has meant that, as a practical matter, nearly any un-
authorized use of a [strong] trade symbol with the potential to
undermine  the  symbol's  trademark  distinctiveness  may  per-
suade a federal judge to grant an injunction."169  Accordingly,
today there is  virtually no junior  use  of a strong  mark like
Coca-Cola,  Honda,  or  Kodak  that  would  be  deemed  non-
confusing in an infringement suit.170  In this sense, Schechter's
version of dilution can be viewed as a remedy without a wrong,
since his proposal has been shoved aside by a bigger and better
confusion test.
D.  THE MYSTERIES OF DILUTION LAW
The  holes  in  Schechter's  reasoning obviously  undermine
his proposal, but the problems do not stop there.  To a remark-
able extent, Schechter's proposal looks nothing like the doctrine
that calls him father.  This suggests that courts have grafted a
somewhat  different  conception  of dilution  onto  the  original
165.  The best analysis on this point is by Welkowitz.  See id. at 539-44.

1724 n.44.2001] ONE AND INSEPARABLE
idea, and that Schechter's  construction  should be abandoned.
So let us examine two significant gaps between his theory and
modem dilution: (1) tarnishment and (2) the confusion in dilu-
tion doctrine.
1.  Tarnishment
The most striking way in which Schechter and modern di-
lution part company is through tarnishment, which involves a
junior use that has an unwholesome  or shoddy reputation in
comparison to the senior mark.  While tarnishment now com-
prises one of the two flavors of dilution, Schechter said nothing
about it.  Furthermore, tarnishment seems to be at odds with
the entire concept of dilution.  After all, tarnishment involves a
direct and obvious injury to a mark that is likely to occur only
once.  This is exactly the opposite  of the subtle but corrosive
multiple junior uses that Schechter was worried about.171 Even
if tarnishment does square with dilution, it should be unneces-
sary because it is already basically covered by Schechter's idea.
If a junior use of a strong mark is diluting, then surely such a
use that also injures the reputation of the senior user would be
diluting.
Due to this conflict between tarnishment  and Schechter's
proposal,  many  of dilution's  supporters  and  detractors  have
concluded  that tarnishment is  not a legitimate  part  of dilu-
tion.172  While  conceding  that tarnishment  may  be  a  harm
worth  addressing via some  other legal theory,  they maintain
that it "is both unduly broad in scope and largely unrelated to
the dilution concept."73  Yet tarnishment remains  a co-equal
partner (with blurring) in dilution law.  So as an initial matter,
Schechter's reasoning cannot explain about half of dilution doc-
trine.
171.  See Klieger, supra note 9, at 830 ("If the aim of dilution law is to pre-
vent the gradual whittling away of trademark value by enjoining junior uses
of a mark that threaten to destroy the selling power of the mark only in the
aggregate, then tarnishment should not qualify as dilution at all.").

2.  Applying Dilution
Moreover, seven decades after Schechter's article was pub-
lished,  courts  are  still  unable  to  figure  out  what  dilution
means.174  The first comprehensive attempt to analyze blurring
claims  came  in Judge  Robert  Sweet's  concurring  opinion  in
Mead Data Central, Inc. v.  Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A., Inc.175
Judge Sweet argued that six factors ought to govern a blurring
analysis:  (1)  the similarity of the marks;  (2) the similarity  of
the products  covered  by the marks;  (3)  the  sophistication  of
consumers;  (4) predatory  intent; (5)  the renown  of the senior
mark;  and (6) the renown of the junior mark.176  The so-called
Sweet factors, however, have come under serious attack from
courts and commentators and are no longer a reliable guide for
evaluating blurring claims.177
All the circuits can agree on, however, is that they do not
like Judge Sweet's  framework.  As  a result, the standards  of
blurring law vary widely.  The  First Circuit has  argued that
only three of the Sweet factors (mark similarity, product simi-
larity,  and  senior  mark  renown)  are  relevant  under  the
FTDA.178  For  the  Seventh  Circuit,  only two  Sweet  factors
(mark similarity  and senior  mark renown)  are useful.179  The
Second  and Third Circuits contend instead that the likelihood
of confusion factors should be applied under the FTDA's dilu-
tion prong to ascertain whether blurring has occurred.180  Not
to be outdone, the Ninth Circuit has explained that the confu-
sion factors should essentially be used under the FTDA's fame
prong rather than the dilution prong.181

ment law is not a model of clarity either, but this discussion will look at how
courts have handled blurring actions since they reflect Schechter's  original
model.

In contrast, the Fourth and Fifth Circuits have opined that
plaintiffs  must  establish "actual dilution" of their  mark and
therefore contextual factors like those proposed by Judge Sweet
are almost always inappropriate.  These circuits contend that
only direct evidence of lost sales or sophisticated consumer sur-
veys can establish actual dilution.182  The actual dilution stan-
dard of proof articulated by these courts is based on the FTDA's
statement that a plaintiff must  show  that the  offending use
"causes dilution."  This  is  in contrast  to  most state dilution
laws, which require only a showing of "likelihood of dilution."183
Thus, the Fourth and Fifth Circuits have  concluded that the
federal statute must incorporate  a more stringent standard of
proof. As a matter of textual construction, they may be correct.
But the problem with their interpretation,  as the Second  and
Seventh  Circuits  have  observed,  is  that  the  actual  dilution
standard 'holds plaintiffs to an impossible standard of proof."'84
Each of these  approaches  to the FTDA has its problems,
but the important point is that the same legal concept has gen-
erated so many different tests.185  When so many courts acting
in good faith cannot make sense out a legal formula, whether
embodied in a statute or an article, that suggests the presence
of a defect in the authority the courts have been given.186
As this discussion demonstrates,  Schechter made his pro-
posal in response  to valid  concerns  about the state  of trade-
mark law during the early twentieth century.  Unfortunately,
1999).  There is probably no meaningful difference between the Second, Third,
and Ninth Circuit approaches, but the Ninth Circuit's framework of analysis
in dilution cases is still a little unclear.

185.  The Fourth and Fifth Circuit's faith in consumer surveys seems mis-
placed. As Nabisco noted, consumer surveys are quite subject to manipulation
and are therefore not highly reliable.  See Nabisco, 191 F.3d at 224.  But see
Bible, supra note 9 (advocating the use of consumer surveys to prove dilution
under the FTDA).
As for the Second, Third, and Ninth Circuit frameworks, there is nothing
wrong with applying the confusion factors in a blurring case since dilution fol-
lows from confusion.  The problem is that dilution claims often do not involve
consumer confusion, and then the confusion factors will not be helpful.  For a
closer examination of why the confusion factors may not speak to dilution, see
Klieger, supra note 9, at 826-27; Welkowitz, supra note 10, at 573-74.

his explanation of dilution does not work.  It has faltered under
academic scrutiny;  it may be unconstitutional;  it does not ex-
plain tarnishment  doctrine;  and  it cannot  be applied  clearly.
The time has come to seek out a new interpretation of dilution
that addresses these issues.
III. LEGAL OBSOLESCENCE AND OVERSHOOTING
This Part reads Schechter's dilution proposal as a remedy
against infringement obsolescence.  After examining this alter-
native interpretation in the context of the broader legal obso-
lescence problem,  the analysis assesses  the transformation  of
the relationship between dilution and infringement  once dilu-
tion is given an obsolescence  gloss.  One part of that transfor-
mation is the risk of "overshooting" that inheres in dilution or
any  other effort to  revise outdated laws.  Broad  statutes de-
signed to help courts keep the law abreast of economic and so-
cial change can often lead to excessive protection of the legal in-
terest at stake.  In other words, by trying hard to avoid falling
behind, the law may end up racing too far ahead.187
A.  MISCHIEVOUS INTERPRETATION
Just as ambiguous or unworkable statutes are often inter-
preted by focusing on the mischief the law is directed against,
Schechter's article can be construed by looking at the mischief
he was worried about: obsolete infringement law.188  Defects in
the  consumer  confusion  test  were  an  important  focus  of
Schechter's 1925 treatise.189  A few years later, his dilution ar-
ticle made repeated references to an outdated common law un-
derstanding  of marks  that needed  fixing.190  Moreover,  com-
mentators in subsequent decades have argued that Schechter
was motivated by a desire to modernize trademark law.191  All
187.  As  the Roman Emperor  Hadrian  (117-138  A.D.)  once  commented,
"Laws change more slowly than custom, and though dangerous when they fall
behind the times [they] are more dangerous still when they presume to antici-
pate customs."  MARGUERITE YOURCENAR,  MEMOIRS OF HADRIAN  113 (Grace
Frick trans. 1954).

as shall suppress the mischief, and advance the remedy").

in  all, there  is little doubt that musty infringement  doctrine
was the mischief that sparked the original dilution proposal.
This view of Schechter's  remedy is reinforced by the fact
that he wrote during a time when scholars commonly  decried
the common law's inability to keep up with the needs of a mod-
em industrial economy.192  In part, the hidebound state of the
common law at that time "may have been due to the dominance
in the late nineteenth  and early twentieth  centuries  of legal
formalism, which..,  reduced  the willingness  and capacity  of
courts  to  perform  their traditional  role  as  reshapers  of the
common law."193  Whatever the explanation, legal thinking dur-
ing the first half of the twentieth century tended to exalt broad
statutes guided by administrative agencies as the best method
of commercial regulation.194  Faith in statutory reform and ad-
ministrative  agencies  has  been  tempered by  experience,  but
that era's view of the relative merits of statutes and the com-
mon  law  must  be  taken  into  account  when  interpreting
Schechter's proposal.
Give  the statutory mischief dilution was directed toward
and the problems that follow from Schechter's reasoning, it  is
perfectly  reasonable  to  construe  dilution  as  a more  narrow
remedy for infringement obsolescence.  This does not mean that
an obsolescence reading of Schechter's remedy is the best con-
struction of what he actually meant.  Even a cursory review of
his argument shows that he did want to protect the persuasive
power of distinctive marks by barring most unauthorized  com-
mercial uses of those marks.  If we were interpreting a statute,
the legitimacy of a reading that ignored such clear authorial in-
tent would be shaky unless serious constitutional concerns ne-
man, supra note 11, at 1724 n.41.

in the United States, 50 HARV. L. REV. 4 (1936).

CALABRESI, supra note 192, at 44-58; infra text accompanying notes 201-06.
Schechter was  sympathetic  to the  idea  of getting administrative  agencies
heavily involved in trademark protection.  In his treatise, he suggested that
the regulation of marks could be removed from the common law entirely and
placed under the auspices of the Federal Trade Commission.  See SCHECHTER,
supra note 30, at 164-65; Klieger, supra note 9, at 807.MINNESOTA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 85:949
cessitated the construction.195  Since Schechter's proposal was
in the form of an article, however, we have more interpretive
flexibility.  Accordingly, a recharacterization  of dilution into a
limited tool of infringement reform is both desirable and possi-
ble.
Of course, just because  an obsolescence reading of dilution
is plausible does not mean that it is any better than Schechter's
version.196  Only by comparing a revisionist interpretation with
the actual development of trademark law over the decades can
its  merits be  evaluated.  Before beginning that examination,
however, the implications of injecting dilution into the legal ob-
solescence debate must be considered.
B.  MUSTY STATUTES AND DYNAMIC INTERPRETATION
Over the past thirty years, legal obsolescence has become a
significant concern for academic commentators. 97  In express-
195.  It could be argued that legislatures passed dilution laws pursuant to
Schechter's reasoning, and therefore statutes are being interpreted (or rein-
terpreted) by providing a new reading to Schechter's article.  Although his ar-
gument certainly formed the backdrop of state dilution laws and the FTDA,
little in the text  or legislative  history  of these  statutes  refers  directly to
Schechter or to his ideas.  Moreover,  legislatures have not simply enacted
Schecter's proposal jot-for-jot, hence we should not give his rationale the au-
thority of a statutory enactment.  See Ringling Bros.-Barnum & Bailey Com-
bined Shows, Inc. v. Utah Div. of Travel Dev.,  170 F.3d 449, 456 (4th Cir.),
cert. denied, 528 U.S. 923 (1999).
196.  Once dilution is cast as an obsolescence remedy, however, many con-
ceptual objections to dilution disappear.  First, dilution no longer seeks to pro-
tect the persuasive power of marks, so that ground of criticism becomes moot.
Second, there are no constitutional problems with using dilution primarily as
a means of extending protection in the face of outdated consumer confusion
test-assuming that such obsolescence actually exists.
One could still argue that dilution is unnecessary because infringement
law is currently providing adequate protection, but this attack is unavailing.
For one thing, proponents of a limited version of dilution can concede that it is
not needed now but maintain that it should be kept on the books in case in-
fringement ever stumbles.  More important, as Part VI shows, dilution has re-
cently proven useful in safeguarding the location-identifying function of marks
on the Internet. See infra Part VI.B.
197.  See, e.g.,  CALABRESI,  supra note 192; WILLIAM N. ESKRIDGE JR. &
PHILLIP P. FRICKEY, LEGISLATION:  STATUTES AND THE  CREATION OF PUBLIC
POLICY  (1988); Jack Davies, A Response to Statutory Obsolescence: The Non-
primacy of Statutes Act, 4 VT. L. REV. 203 (1979); Henry J. Friendly, The Gap
in Law Making-Judges Who Can't and Legislators Who Won't, 63 COLUM. L.
REV. 787 (1963); Donald C. Langevoort, Statutory Obsolescence and the Judi-
cial Process: The Revisionist Role of Courts in Federal Banking Regulation, 85
MICH. L. REV. 672 (1987).
In the intellectual property context, Bruce P. Keller has pointed out that a2001] ONE AND INSEPARABLE 989
ing this concern, obsolescence  scholars have focused primarily
on  outdated  statutes.  This  reflects  both  the  prevalence  of
statutory law in the American  system and some  disenchant-
ment with the legal process  consequences  of the modern wel-
fare state.198  What particularly interests these authors is the
cumbersome  way  in which  statutes  are  enacted.  As  we  all
learn in civics class, bills must go through many hoops before
becoming law.199  While this legislative  inertia serves a valu-
able role by protecting the rights of minorities in our society,
the downside  is that, once passed, statutes can be difficult to
change.200  The  potential  for  statutory  obsolescence  is  com-
pounded by the fact that, due to the principle of legislative su-
premacy,  courts  are  ordinarily  not permitted  to  "sunset" old
statutes in the way that they often retire outdated common-law
201
holdings.
Several  creative  approaches  have been  proposed  to  deal
with statutory obsolescence when legislatures fail to resolve the
problem  themselves.  The school  of "dynamic statutory inter-
pretation" argues that courts should update statutes by giving
them broad and purposive  readings when "societal  and legal
circumstances have changed so as to unravel material assump-
variety of archaic common law doctrines help fix obsolescence in copyright and
trademark law.  See Keller, supra note 34, at 403.  For instance, he argues
that the Supreme Court's creation of the oft-criticized tort of misappropriation
in InternationalN  ews Service v. Associated Press, 248 U.S. 215 (1918), was
largely the result of technology outpacing the development of federal copyright
statutes.  See Keller, supra note 34, at 406-07; see also Brown, supra note 16,
at 1200 (criticizing misappropriation as based on a "gross fallacy").  Just as an
aside, Keller notes that some of the early misappropriation cases would proba-
bly have fallen within the scope of dilution had it existed at the time. See Kel-
ler, supra note 34, at 412 n.52; see also Brown, supra note 16, at 1200 (compar-
ing dilution and misappropriation).
198.  As Grant Gilmore once quipped, we have witnessed an "orgy of statute
making."  See GILMORE, supra note 193, at 95.  Some fifty percent of the Su-
preme  Court's  opinions  each  term concern  statutory  interpretation.  See
WILLIAM N.  ESKRIDGE  JR., DYNAMIC  STATUTORY INTERPRETATION  335 n.3
(1994).
199.  Some of the obstacles to legislative action include (1) legislative com-
mittees, (2) bicameralism, (3) filibusters, and (4) the executive veto.
200.  Eskridge  and Frickey  identify four categories  of statutory obsoles-
cence: (1) quantity (specific figures that fall out of date), (2) policy (the fit be-
tween an old statute and more current law), (3) priority (the attention given to
a particular issue as against others), and (4) remedy.  ESKRIDGE & FRICKEY,

tions made  in the statute.202  Another  author  contends that
courts  have  used literalism  as  a technique  to bring  obsolete
banking statutes into line with modem policy norms.203 A third
view is that judges should be given a common law power over
statutes precisely so that obsolete laws (like outdated common
law rules) can be gradually phased out.2°4  Finally, there is the
idea that administrative  agencies  should be  delegated  broad
authority  to  adjust  statutes when  necessary.25  All  four ap-
proaches  have their critics, of course,  but together these doc-
trines point out that statutory obsolescence is a troubling issue
that raises profound legal process questions.26  Viewing dilu-
tion statutes as an obsolescence  remedy adds a new dimension
to this debate.
C.  DILUTION AND "REVERSE-OBSOLESCENCE"
A revisionist interpretation of dilution breaks with the con-
sensus of legal obsolescence  scholarship in two major respects.
First,  Schechter  was  concerned  about  common-law  obsoles-
cence, not statutory obsolescence.  Indeed, in line with the pre-
vailing legal process values of his time, he viewed statutes as
the solution to outdated  legal rules.207  Modem  proponents  of
obsolescence  remedies do not contend that the common law is
immune from aging, but they virtually all agree that the com-
mon law is far better than the legislative  process at handling
changing circumstances.2 8  Second, in the dilution context, the
202.  ESKRIDGE, supra note 198, at 112.
203.  See Langevoort, supra note 197, at 729-30.  Langevoort's argument is
that advances in financial practices over the decades made the intent behind
Depression-era banking statutes like the Glass-Steagall Act increasingly obso-
lete.  See id.  To limit the potential damage of these laws, courts construed
them literally and thereby blunted their impact. See id. at 716-19, 729-30.

lescence through judicial action, see Robert Weisberg, The CalabresianJ udi-

PA.  L. REV.  2209  (1995)  (reviewing  WILLIAM  N. ESKRIDGE  JR.,  DYNAMIC
STATUTORY INTERPRETATION (1994)).
207.  See supra text accompanying notes 192-94 (describing the prevailing
thought on common-law obsolescence).
208.  See CALABRESI, supra note 192, at 73 ("Obsolete laws do not really ex-
ist, the devotees of the common law would say, when legal rules respond in a
changing, accretional, and continuous way to the underlying principles of the
people.").
This is a debate that need not be resolved here.  It is worth pointing out,2001] ONE AND INSEPARABLE
obsolescence remedy was enacted as a statute that looked like
substantive law.  Edward L. Rubin has pointed out that many
statutes  are  better  understood  as  establishing  directives  to
other organs of government "rather than as a set of rules for
the governance  of human conduct."209  That is the case here.
Although dilution is in the form of and was partly intended to
be a substantive  rule (i.e., Schechter's  approach), we  will see
that it  behaves like a directive to the courts to root out trade-
mark protection obsolescence.210
Dilution's unique role as an enacted obsolescence  remedy
raises three important questions.  First, what should such an
anti-obsolescence statute look like?  Second, what happens dur-
ing those periods when a statute designed to fight obsolescence
itself becomes obsolete?211 Third, is there a danger in putting an
obsolescence remedy into a substantive form?  The first issue is
the easiest.  To give courts the maximum flexibility in dealing
with doctrinal obsolescence, dilution statutes would need to be
drafted as broadly  as possible.212  This, of course,  is basically
what happened.  Of course, interpreting these expansive  laws
poses the considerable challenge that this Article seeks to ad-
dress.
Resolving the second issue throws light on the deep con-
nections between infringement and dilution.  Under an obsoles-
cence  reading of Schechter, if infringement was not doing its
job at any particular time, we would expect dilution to receive a
liberal reading and thereby accomplish its objective.  But sup-
however, that legislative inertia prevented Schechter's  proposal from being
enacted for more than twenty years.  See infra text accompanying notes 246-
48.  Furthermore, by the time dilution laws were finally passed, the common
law had made considerable progress  in easing infringement's  obsolescence.
See infra text accompanying notes 246-48.  As a result, Schechter's confidence
in the legal-process superiority of legislatures may have been misplaced.
209.  Edward L. Rubin, Law and Legislation in the Administrative State, 89
COLUM. L. REV. 369, 371-72 (1989).
210.  Of course, applying dilution as a substantive rule of law creates all
kinds of problems. See supra Parts II.C-D.
211.  The  Latin  maxim  "Quis  custodiet  custodiens?"  (Who  guards  the
guards?) captures the second issue.
212.  The best way to understand how dilution works is to think of a dog
race.  To get the dogs to run faster, the track releases a mechanical rabbit
from the starting gate so that they will have something to chase.  The rabbit
goes much faster than any dog could possibly run, but this is precisely what
makes it a good lure.  Dilution, like the dog-track rabbit, sets a bar of trade-
mark protection that is much higher than society would actually want.  Yet
this is what allows dilution to exert a gravitational pull that can lift infringe-
ment out of its obsolescence when necessary.MINNESOTA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 85:949
pose  that the circumstances  were  reversed  and infringement
was doing its job properly.  At that point, dilution law would be
unnecessary.  Accordingly,  if dilution acts as  an obsolescence
remedy, then it  follows that it  should not be applied when in-
fringement is free from obsolescence.
Stated  more generally,  if dilution is primarily  used as  a
tool  to  correct defects  in infringement,  then  dilution  and in-
fringement  doctrine  should move  inversely to  one  another.213
This is the pattern that we will be looking for in the case law.214
Dilution  should  achieve  its  greatest  prominence  when  in-
fringement  has  obsolescence  problems,  but then  vanish into
oblivion  when  infringement  once  again  meets  the  needs  of
trademark protection.  Moreover, this harmonious ebb and flow
between the two  trademark  doctrines could go through many
repetitions.  Each time infringement undergoes a bout of obso-
lescence  the  cycle will  begin  anew.  This  model  means  that
courts may need to interpret dilution as someone plays an ac-
cordion: first broad, then narrow, then broad, and then narrow
again.  Managing this task without the aid of administrative
agencies requires some creative judging.
While using a statute as an obsolescence remedy may cre-
ate an elegant set of doctrinal relationships,  the risk posed by
this  solution  is  statutory  "overshooting"  or  "reverse-
obsolescence."  As  was  mentioned  earlier, in  order to  sweep
away  outdated  rules,  dilution  statutes  have  to  be  drafted
broadly.  Although courts should not apply these laws when no
obsolescence is present, some courts will inevitably err and ex-
tend dilution protection  in this situation.  This  could happen
because  a court fails to see that dilution should not be treated
as a substantive rule, or because, in its zeal to carry out dilu-
tion's mandate, a court sees obsolescence  where there is none.
In both cases, the result is the same.  Instead of pushing obso-
lete trademark protection  to its  proper equilibrium level  and
then stopping, dilution just keeps on pushing and thereby over-
shoots  the equilibrium point.  This  ends  up giving too  much
213.  If dilution was primarily a substantive rule, on the other hand, then
dilution should basically display a linear relationship that is unconnected to
infringement.  One could argue that dilution might initially be interpreted
narrowly as befits a new remedy, and then gradually expand as it gained ac-
ceptance.  This pattern is markedly different from the cyclical pattern that
would be produced by an obsolescence reading.
214.  See infra Parts IV-V.2001] ONE AND INSEPARABLE 993
protection  to mark owners at the expense of the public inter-
215
est.
Overshooting is the mirror opposite  of obsolescence.26  If
legal backwardness  is left untended, courts get saddled with a
set of rules that do  not balance  competing  societal  interests
particularly well.  Because a statutory solution to obsolescence
(as  administered  by the courts)  needs  to be  drafted  broadly,
however, its literal application would just end up creating a dif-
ferent set of ill-fitting rules.  The  only distinction is that each
set of ill-fitting rules provides  a windfall to different  interest
group  coalitions.  Since  this  would  probably  not  be  an  im-
provement over the status quo, dilution and all other obsoles-
cence remedies must guard against overshooting.217
Schechter's proposal can reasonably be read as an obsoles-
cence remedy.  Furthermore, this reading illuminates new fac-
ets of the legal obsolescence debate while offering clear predic-
tions about how dilution and infringement should behave.  Now
it  is time to see how dilution and infringement  have actually
interacted.
215.  See White v. Samsung Elecs. Am., Inc., 989 F.2d 1512, 1513 (9th Cir.
1993) (Kozinski, J., dissenting from the denial of rehearing en banc) ("Over-
protecting intellectual property is as harmful as underprotecting it. Creativity
is impossible without a rich public domain....  Culture, like science and tech-
nology, grows by accretion, each new creator building on the works of those
who came before.  Overprotection stifles the very creative forces it's supposed
to nurture.").
216.  In the context of the judicial or interpretive solutions to statutory ob-
solescence  canvassed  earlier,  the overshooting  phenomenon  tends  to  get
wrapped  up in  a  discussion  about legitimacy.  Rather  than focusing  on
whether courts charged with eradicating obsolescence will go too far and an-
ticipate legal developments, opponents of judicial obsolescence remedies usu-
ally challenge  the constitutional  and democratic  validity of judicial  value
judgments that would override prior legislative decisions.
217.  Although  there  are  many circumstances  in which  courts  construe
statutes narrowly for policy reasons, that decision is ordinarily premised on
the notion that the statute was drafted poorly and therefore needs to be con-
strained.  In the case of dilution, however, there is no error in the statutory
language.  We want dilution laws to be broad, but we also want them inter-
preted narrowly on certain occasions.
Perhaps the closest analogy is the criminal law.  Penal statutes are ordi-
narily written in sweeping terms in order to give prosecutors the authority
they need to obtain guilty pleas and flip witnesses for information about other
crimes.  Applying these kinds of laws literally, however, would probably over-
deter marginal activity.  To prevent this result, the criminal justice system
has developed many methods, including prosecutorial discretion, jury discre-
tion, extensive procedural protections, and the rule of lenity to control the ap-
plication of broad criminal statutes.  In the dilution context, however, the bur-
den of preventing overshooting rests entirely on interpreting courts.MINNESOTA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 85:949
IV.  INFRINGEMENT AND DILUTION IN TRANSITION
This  Part  offers  support  for  an  obsolescence  reading  of
Schechter by looking at the rhythm of trademark doctrine from
the publication of his article in 1927 until the development of
the modem consumer confusion test in Polaroid2.18  As long as
infringement  remained stuck  in a rut, dilution was  cited fa-
vorably  by courts  and  commentators  seeking  to preserve  the
mark's quality function.  When judges finally started adapting
infringement in the 1940s and 1950s, they contextualized  the
problem of quality-function  protection, in part, by finding con-
fusion in cases where a mark's junior user sold shoddy or unsa-
vory goods that could harm the senior user's reputation.  This
focus on the quality of the junior user's goods would have sig-
nificant implications for both infringement and dilution.  As in-
fringement  finally emerged from its  obsolescence  by the late
1950s and early 1960s, dilution was read into oblivion in accord
with the predictions of the conceptual framework.
A.  DILUTION IN THE VANGUARD
Schechter's  concept initially  received  a rousing reception
from those who wanted to expand trademark protection in non-
competing goods cases.219  A typical example of the early judi-
cial response was Tiffany & Co. v.  Tiffany Productions,I nc.,220
in which the Tiffany boutique  sought to  enjoin the use of its
218.  Polaroid Corp. v. Polarad Elecs. Corp., 287 F.2d 492 (2d Cir. 1961).
219.  See, e.g.,  Stork Restaurant,  Inc. v. Sahati, 166  F.2d 348  (9th Cir.
1948); Philadelphia Storage Battery Co. v. Mindlin, 296 N.Y.S. 176, 179 (N.Y.

Pattishall, The Case for Anti-Dilution Trade-mark Statutes, 43 TRADE-MARK
REP. 887 (1953).
Brown contended that in these early years dilution "made little headway."
See Brown, supra note 16, at 1195 & n.124.  He correctly observed that dilu-
tion was not cited in a large number of cases and that there was an element of
confusion in each case where dilution was mentioned.  Nevertheless, Schech-
ter's idea was almost always cited favorably when it was discussed, and its use
was relatively frequent when one considers that it had not been enacted any-
where during that time.  See infra text accompanying notes 246-48.  As for the
existence of confusion in these early cases, that coheres quite well with an
argument that courts used dilution as a tool to extend trademark protection in
marginal situations.  If no evidence of confusion was present, then, under an
obsolescence  reading  of dilution,  using  dilution  to  grant  mark  owners
protection would have been  inappropriate.  After all, even  an updated  in-
fringement regime would not have granted relief in such a case.
220.  264 N.Y.S. at 462.2001] ONE AND INSEPARABLE
mark by a local movie theater.221  Although the court made a
formal finding of likely consumer confusion, the opinion relied
heavily on dilution theory and found for the plaintiff.222 Tiffany
&  Co. expressly  adopted  Schechter's  "whittling" definition  of
the trademark injury, and then argued that the theater had ob-
tained "an unfair advantage for [itself]  from the good will cre-
ated by plaintiff in the name.  The purpose of [the movie thea-
ter's]  acts was wrongfully and unfairly to appropriate for [its]
pecuniary gain the value plaintiff had created in [its] own name
and...  unique business and financial reputation."223  This was
not the language of traditional infringement.
An identical approach was on display in Bulova Watch Co.
v. Stolzberg.224  Plaintiff produced "Bulova watches," which was
a well-known watch brand at that time.225  Defendant, a shoe-
maker, knew of Bulova watches and decided to market a brand
of "Bulova Fine Shoes. 226  The Court first held that plaintiffs
infringement  action could not succeed  because,  under the re-
strictive  precedents,  shoes  and watches  were not  sufficiently
similar products to sustain a finding of likely consumer confu-
227
sion.
Although that should have been the end  of the case, the
Court instead invoked dilution theory and ruled for the plain-
tiff. As the Court stated, "A use by the defendant, even on non-
competing goods, may result in injury to the plaintiffs reputa-
tion and dilute the quality of the trade-mark."228  Since Bulova
was  a  "unique  family  name,"  the  defendant,  "by  using  the
trade-mark on low price shoes, stands to injure plaintiffs repu-
tation and dilute the quality of his trade-mark.2 29

To  explain  the early popularity  of dilution,  one  needs to
look no further than at the continuing stagnation in infringe-
ment law.  After the thunderclap  of Schechter's  article, there
were some  indications that courts  understood the need to re-
form the consumer confusion test and protect the mark's qual-
ity function.  In  1928, Learned  Hand  authored  Yale  Electric
Corp. v.  Robertson,230 which affirmed a finding of likely confu-
sion between Yale locks  and Yale flashlights  and batteries.231
Hand explained that the modern mark required a broader defi-
nition of consumer confusion:
[A] merchant may have a sufficient economic interest in the use of his
mark outside the field of his own exploitation to justify inter-position
by a court.  His mark is his authentic seal; by it he vouches for the
goods which bear it; it carries his name for good or ill.  If another uses
it,  he borrows the owner's reputation, whose quality no longer lies
within his own control.  This is an injury, even though the borrower
does not tarnish it, or divert sales by its use; for a reputation, like a
face, is the symbol of its possessor and creator, and another can use it
2
only as a mask.
Hand's  recognition  of the need  for  greater  infringement
protection was not limited to a single case.  Six years later, in
L.E. Waterman Co. v.  Gordon,233 he wrote another  opinion af-
firming an infringement violation, this time involving Water-
man fountain pens  and Waterman razor blades.234  Hand ar-
gued that while goods like lipstick and steam shovels might be
too unrelated to support a finding of likely confusion, fountain
pens and razor blades were still close enough to justify relief.235
Hopes for real change  in infringement doctrine were soon
dashed, however, as Hand himself led an effort to cut back on
230.  26 F.2d 972 (2d Cir. 1928) (L. Hand, J.).
231.  See id. at 974.  Hand based his decision on the "Aunt Jemima" doc-
trine, which held that very closely related products could support a finding of
likely consumer confusion.  See Aunt Jemima Mills Co. v. Rigney & Co., 247 F.
407, 410 (2d Cir. 1917) (finding likely consumer confusion between Aunt Je-
mima pancakes and syrup).  The Yale  opinion, however, gave an expansive
reading to Aunt Jemima that would then be limited for a time by the Second
Circuit.
This portion of the analysis focuses on Second Circuit cases.  During the
relevant time period, Learned Hand's court was the unquestioned leader in
trademark law.

the Yale/Waterman line  of cases.236  The  turnabout  came  in
1940  during the first appeal in S.C. Johnson & Son, Inc. v.
Johnson,237 which pitted Johnson floor cleaner against Johnson
fabric cleaner.238  In contrast to the broad protection Hand had
previously advocated, this time he was willing to issue only a
limited  injunction  that  required  the junior  user  to  put the
phrase "made by Johnson Products Company, Buffalo, N.Y." on
its fabric cleaner.239
Although the use of the same mark on products as closely
related as floor cleaner and fabric cleaner was a strong candi-
date for infringement relief, Hand and some of his colleagues
were  now more  concerned  about the  danger  of giving  mark
owners  a  commercial  monopoly.240  Accordingly,  Hand wrote
that  infringement  relief for  non-competing  goods  was  war-
ranted under only two circumstances:  (1)  when the senior user
was likely to expand into the junior user's market; (2) when the
junior use could  injure  the senior user's  reputation.241  This
transitional confusion test is explained further in the next sec-
tion.  For now, the critical point is that the modified Hand ap-
proach, while a clear effort to help modernize trademark law,
still significantly restricted the ability of mark owners to get re-

at 178.  Hand wrote for the majority and rejected the plaintiffs motion.  In
keeping with his new, conservative view of trademark protection, Hand de-
clared that the Lanham Act only codified the existing common law of in-

dilution analysis a little bit astray. In essence, Klieger contends that the con-
sumer confusion test had expanded adequately by the 1940s to render dilutionMINNESOTA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 85:949
The link between the ascent of dilution and the sluggish-
ness of infringement was recognized by contemporary scholars.
For instance, Beverly W.  Pattishall,  one  of dilution's leading
advocates,  conceded  that his support for  dilution was mainly
due to the inadequate  protection that the confusion  test pro-
vided to the modern mark.243  Meanwhile,  other commentators
agreed  that  infringement  needed  to  be  expanded,  and  they
therefore suggested  that the baseline for measuring confusion
be changed from the "reasonably careful purchaser" to the "ig-
norant purchaser."24  In sum, most experts at that time agreed
on the need to expand trademark protection.  The central ques-
tion was whether this should be accomplished through a much
broader confusion test or through dilution.245
The  enthusiastic  response  to  dilution  from  the  1920s
through the 1940s was all the more remarkable given that dilu-
tion was not enacted anywhere until 1947.246  For courts to cite
a mere academic theory as a basis for relief during this period
was unusual, and demonstrates the desperate desire to fill the
void  between  infringement  law  and  the  felt  necessities  of
trademark  protection.  Of course,  one  could turn this around
and argue that since it took so long to enact dilution in the face
of concerns  about outdated  infringement doctrine,  Schechter's
proposal  cannot  properly be read as an  obsolescence  remedy.
This  criticism  is misplaced.  It is perfectly  natural  to expect
that a  new approach  to trademark  protection  would initially
encounter  resistance.  Even  legislators  genuinely  concerned
with  the state  of infringement  doctrine  would have  been in-
clined to give courts more time to adjust the law before impos-
unnecessary.  By anticipating the eventual  expansion of infringement law,
Klieger fails to see that the link between dilution and infringement that he
brilliantly identified in Schechter's original proposal continued afterwards.  In
particular, Kieger does not recognize how infringement's expansion explains
the development of dilution by tarnishment.  See infra Part V.
243.  See Pattishall, supra note 219, at 892-93.
244.  See Brown, supra note 16, at 1195-98.  This relaxed baseline eventu-
ally became  the standard.  Cf Coca-Cola  Co. v. Gemini Rising, Inc., 346 F.
Supp. 1183, 1190 (E.D.N.Y. 1972) (defining the ordinary purchaser as includ-
ing the ignorant purchaser).
245.  In this sense, Schechter's dilution proposal was not quite as radical as
its detractors claim.  An expansion of the consumer confusion test only looks
less problematic because it was a change in degree instead of a change in kind.
But a sweeping change in degree-like the one proposed by Brown--can be
just as radical as developing a new framework of analysis like Schechter did.
246.  See, e.g.,  Ringling Bros.-Barnum & Bailey Combined Shows, Inc. v.

ing an entirely new statutory regime.  This reflects exactly the
kind of legislative  inertia that concerns  modern  obsolescence
scholars.247  Legislative reluctance to embrace dilution in these
early years, therefore, does not undermine the fact that Schech-
ter's idea achieved a remarkable degree of attention as a way of
fighting infringement obsolescence.
By the late 1940s and early 1950s, legislative patience with
the common law process wore thin and states started to pass
dilution statutes.  Massachusetts enacted the first in 1947, and
New York, Illinois, and Georgia  soon followed  suit.248  In the
initial stage of the trademark life cycle,  courts and commenta-
tors saw dilution as an excellent way to modernize trademark
protection.  Yet just as dilution began to gain traction in state
legislatures, the consumer  confusion test started to  overcome
its problems.
B.  A QUALITY BRIDGE
While  Learned Hand  did prolong the  obsolescence  of in-
fringement law in Johnson, his focus on the mark owner's ex-
pansion and reputational interests was a key step in the transi-
tion  to  the  modem  confusion  test.  Hand  and  his
contemporaries  faced a dilemma.  They knew that industrial
commerce  had  changed  the mark's  primary  function.  They
were also aware that this transformation  required new think-
ing about the way marks were protected.  But the path to a
broader  confusion test that did not chill competition  was un-
clear.  As  a result, courts built on the foundations of existing
infringement law and also contextualized the problem of qual-
ity-function protection by focusing on the quality of the junior
user's products.
The first Johnson factor, the likelihood that the senior user
would expand into a junior user's market, was  simply an ex-
pansion of time-tested doctrine.  Schechter argued in his dilu-
tion article that a mark owner should receive the broadest pos-
sible protection for the expansion of his or her trade into other
product lines.249  The rationale for what we now call the "bridg-
247.  See supra Part III.B.
248.  See Act of May 2, 1947, ch. 307, § 7a, 1947 Mass. Acts 300 (codified as
amended at MASS.  GEN. LAWS ANN. ch. 110B, § 12 (West 1999)); Klieger, su-
pra note 9, at 812.  The Illinois and Massachusetts  dilution laws may well
have been specifically intended to fix infringement obsolescence.  See Klieger,
supra note 9, at 812 n.126.
249.  See Schechter, supra note 1, at 823.1000 MINNESOTA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 85:949
ing the gap" element in infringement analysis is pretty obvious.
Since  infringement  was  concerned  with  preventing  a  direct
competitor  from using  a particular  mark,  then the  use of a
mark by someone who was likely to become a direct competitor
in the future could  also be a logical basis for protection.  All
Hand's  attention on  bridging the gap  did, therefore,  was ad-
vance a somewhat broader view of the competitive relationship
necessary to justify relief.  This was an incremental step well
within the established framework of infringement analysis.250
Hand's interest in the potential harm to the reputation of
the  senior  user,  however,  was  more  original  and  presented
complications that often cloud our understanding of trademark
law.  Since marks served a quality-identifying function, looking
at the quality  disparity between  the junior  and senior users
made  sense.  When  a junior  user  sells  shoddy  or  unsavory
goods, the injury to the quality function is more palpable than
if the goods are similar in quality to the senior user.  In the lat-
ter case,  the  quality consistency  the mark  symbolizes  is un-
dermined.251  If the junior user's goods are lousy, however, the
quality information conveyed by the mark is also affirmatively
diminished by the negative associations consumers might make
with the senior user's products.  In that case, "the disappointed
expectations  of buyers will presumably be vented against any
article bearing the symbol.  Thus the [mark owner]  loses pre-
sent and perhaps future sales."252  Junior good quality was also
an appropriate starting point for common-law courts because it
consisted of readily observable facts.
Using the quality of the junior user's products  as  an ele-
ment of infringement analysis, however, creates an interesting
paradox.  While  the harm  to  a mark owner  may be greater
when the junior user produces junk, that scenario  actually re-
duces the likelihood of consumer confusion as such.253  This is
because customers are less likely to believe that truly shoddy or
unsavory  goods  come  from  a mark  owner  with  an excellent
250.  This step still went too far for Judge Frank.  He argued that in non-
competing goods cases a mark owner "should always be required to prove that
defendant's product is so substandard that, if that product be associated by
consumers with plaintiff, impairment of plaintiffs good-will is a likely result."

reputation.  Furthermore, there is considerable merit to the no-
tion that, in fact, "product[s]  of equal quality promote  confu-
sion that they come from the same source."254
When the reputation  behind the senior and junior goods
differs  sharply, there  is a legitimate  question  as  to whether
consumers  will actually think that the mark owner sponsored
the inferior goods.  Suppose that someone sees a topless dance
bar called the Kodak Lounge.  For obvious reasons, this could
confuse  people  into  thinking that  Kodak was  somehow  con-
nected to the bar.  On the other hand, the difference between
the sterling (and rather dull) reputation of Kodak goods and a
sleazy  dance hall leads to the following persuasive argument:
no reasonable person could think that a company like Kodak is
in any way connected to an activity as unsavory as nude danc-
ing.  Just as unrelated products are less likely to be confused
than closely related  goods,  it  is equally  true that items with
unequal quality reputations are less likely to be confused than
goods from  owners  with  similar reputations  for quality.  At
some point, the fine reputation of a senior user should make it
hard for all but the most gullible to conclude that, for example,
Kodak might sponsor nude dancing.
As Part V demonstrates, however, courts have consistently
rejected the argument that consumer confusion is not possible
because  the reputations of the junior and senior users are too
different.255  In part, this is because  Brown's notion that the
baseline  of confusion  analysis  should be  the ignorant  public
rather than the reasonable consumer has been accepted.  More
important, courts have found confusion in these situations not
because confusion is really likely, but because the injury to the
mark's quality symbolism is quite serious among those who do
believe that there is an association between the junior and sen-
ior marks.
Contrast this with a case where the quality of the junior
and senior goods is nearly identical.  Let us say that someone
buys an excellent Tiffany oriental rug.256  Unbeknownst to the
customer, the rug was made by a company unaffiliated with
Tiffany.  Since the rug is pretty good, the individual consumer
walks away satisfied and suffers no short-term injury.  Never-

256.  Assume for purposes of this hypothetical that Tiffany does not sell ori-
ental rugs and thus that there is no direct competition.1002 MINNESOTA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 85:949
theless, long-term  consumer confusion  may well be increased.
Put simply, the similarity between the real and false Tiffany
goods makes it  more difficult for customers to tell which one is
which.  On the other hand, if the false rug is shoddy (i.e., it falls
apart when handled), it would be easier for customers to sepa-
rate a counterfeit from the genuine article.257  Moreover, a par-
ticular  mark arguably  suffers  a more  serious harm when the
junior and senior brands  develop similar reputations  for qual-
ity.  Under those circumstances,  "the consumer not only buys
the counterfeit  product once, but uses  it  and then repeatedly
buys  the  counterfeit  product" because  of its  high  quality.258
This  may be more  difficult to  observe  than the  reputational
harm Hand was concerned about in Johnson, but it is nonethe-
less a significant potential injury.
Thus,  a  survey  of Hand's  refined  infringement  analysis
demonstrates that the protection of the mark's quality function
is best viewed along a continuum embracing two factors: poten-
tial source confusion and reputational injury.  At one end of the
spectrum  is the  case that troubled  Learned  Hand.  This  in-
volves shoddy or unsavory junior goods, and leads to less over-
all  confusion  but a more  direct  injury to the  mark's  quality
symbolism.  On the other end, the reputation of the goods is in-
distinguishable.  This  creates  more  confusion  and hurts the
mark's quality  role by undermining its  consistency,  but does
not  inflict  an  affirmative  injury  to  the  mark's  reputation.
Somewhere in the middle lies a zone  of "no trademark protec-
tion."  This is characterized  by an insufficient combination  of
(1)  some  difference in the junior and senior users' reputation,
and (2) some similarity between the marks and their products.
By broadening  infringement  beyond  the old  common-law
approach,  the  quality  factor  of  Hand's  transitional  formula
helped move the confusion test into the modern era.  Once in-
fringement law overcame its obsolescence, however, the quality
of the junior  user's goods  became  virtually irrelevant  in  in-
fringement  analysis.259  Other contextual factors  proved to be
more  helpful  for  courts  engaged  in  quality-function  protec-
257.  Of course, the consumer may not discover the fraud until he or she has
already purchased the low-quality rug. After that, however, the difference be-
tween the false Tiffany and genuine items will be more obvious.

tion.260  Yet the transitional step to the modern  confusion test
(quality examination) would soon graft itself onto Schechter's
transitional remedy (dilution) to produce a new form of dilution
totally  unrelated  to  Schechter's  proposal  (tarnishment).261
These connections are explained further in Part V, but first let
us see how courts grappled with the meaning of infringement
and dilution in the immediate aftermath of Johnson.
C.  SCHISM IN THE SECOND CIRCUIT
Before  a reformed  consumer  confusion  test could  spring
forth from its cocoon, the Second Circuit had to weather a seri-
ous split between those who read Johnson broadly to modernize
trademark law and those who construed the case in line with
more traditional principles.  As one commentator observed,
Judges Learned  Hand and Jerome Frank  espoused the view that
trademark protection should be sparingly, if at all, applied to protect
uses on non-competitive  goods.  They feared creating a judge-made
"monopoly" in trademarks.  Judges  [Charles]  Clark and Augustus
Hand generally favored application of the broad "related goods" test of
the old... Yale case[.  Judges Swan and Chase sometimes went with
the Learned Hand-Frank faction, sometimes to the Clark-Augustus
22
Hand camp.
The schism within the Court was just part of the difficult effort
to develop the contours of a new confusion test.  For litigants,
however, an unfortunate side effect was that the outcome of in-
fringement  cases during the 1940s  and 1950s often depended
entirely on which panel was sitting.263
The broad reading of Johnson was exemplified by Triangle
Publications,I nc. v. Rohrlich.26  That decision affirmed a find-
ing of likely confusion in an infringement suit brought by the
publisher of Seventeen magazine against a girdle manufacturer
named "Miss Seventeen Foundations Co. 265  The majority opin-
ion by Augustus Hand (joined by Judge Clark) held that the

to likelihood of confusion).

223, 226 (2d Cir. 1953) (Clark, J., dissenting); 4 MCCARTHY, supra note 10, §
24:56 (footnotes omitted).  At that time, the Second Circuit frowned on hearing
cases en banc, which would have been an obvious way to heal the court's split.

numerous advertisements in the magazine for women's clothing
items could lead consumers  to conclude that the plaintiff was
affiliated  with  the  defendant's  girdles.266  In the  majority's
view,  this "would necessarily be  at the risk of the plaintiffs
reputation ... [because]  the erroneously supposed sponsorship
of the plaintiff would injure [its] reputation if goods sold by the
defendants  were inferior to the high quality which the public
attributed  to  the goods  actually  advertised  in or  commented
upon by the magazine.267
Judge  Frank's dissent argued  that Triangle marked  "the
farthest that the courts have been asked to extend the reach of
the unfair competition  trade-name  doctrine.268  Applying the
Johnson framework narrowly, he first argued that there was no
possibility that the magazine  publisher would  ever enter  the
girdle  market.269  Second,  Frank  observed  that the majority
could  not properly grant relief just because  the junior  user's
goods might have a shoddy reputation.270  Instead, the plaintiff
had to prove "that defendant's goods are of a quality inferior to
those advertised in plaintiffs magazine."271  Since plaintiff had
offered no such  proof, Frank  concluded  that an infringement
action could not be sustained.272
On the other side we find Hyde Park Clothes, Inc. v.  Hyde
Park Fashions2,73  in which  a  majority  comprised  of Judges
Swan  and  Frank  found  no  likelihood  of  confusion  between
"Hyde Park" men's suits and "Hyde Park" women's clothing.274
The court gave short shift to the plaintiffs contentions on ap-
peal.  In a brief discussion, the majority held: (1)  that the par-
ties made different kinds of clothes and hence were not in di-
rect  competition;  (2)  that  there  was  no  evidence  that  the
defendant's clothes were inferior to the plaintiffs; and (3) that
there  was  no  evidence  that  the plaintiff would  expand  into
women's clothing.275

This time Judge Clark was the dissenter, and he lamented
that "[plaintiff-appellant has had the misfortune-so it  seems
to me-to  come  before  a  panel  of this  court  allergic  to the
[goods]  doctrine historically associated with us... of protecting
trade names against competition which will create confusion as
to the source of goods sold under such names.276  He pointed
out that the parties were both in "the garment industry," which
were more closely related than the razor blades and pens at is-
sue in the Waterman case.277  While  Clark did implicitly con-
cede that the Johnson elements were not met by ignoring the
issue, he concluded that it "cannot really be in doubt" that con-
sumer confusion was likely in this non-competing goods case.278
He reached this result, in part, by relying on several other con-
textual  factors  (such as the distinctiveness  of the marks  and
their  length  of time in  use) that foreshadowed  the Polaroid
test.279
The  long, divisive  struggle to work  out a new  consumer
confusion test ended by the early 1960s in favor of those who
supported broad protection.  In Polaroid,J udge Friendly used
dicta to propose  his famous eight-factor  formula  for infringe-
ment  analysis.280  A  less  noteworthy  facet  of this  landmark
opinion was its effort to synthesize the competing views within
the  Second Circuit.281  Friendly's  approach  included  the two
Johnson factors,  bridging  the  gap  and  reputational  injury,
along with additional elements that had been on display in the
opinions of those who did not agree with Johnson.282  By reor-
ganizing infringement in this fashion, Friendly brought down
the  curtain  on  a  long-running  show  that  had  started with
Schechter's  observation of trademark law's obsolescence.  The
confusion test was on the verge of being reborn.
D.  DILUTION RETREATS

Schechter's  original  proposal  and  in  subsequent  decades,  it
should come as no surprise that dilution law began its long hi-

bernation just as the modern confusion test emerged in the late
1950s and early 1960s.283  One of the leading cases on dilution's
retreat  was  Esquire, Inc. v.  Esquire Slipper Mfg.  Co.,284  in
which the First Circuit read the Massachusetts dilution statute
to require a likelihood of confusion despite the law's express re-
jection of such a requirement.285  The court reached this rather
astounding result by reasoning that the dilution statute simply
expanded  infringement  protection  into  non-competing  goods
cases by getting rid of the old common law rule that only direct
competitors  were  liable  for  infringement.286  Massachusetts
courts took a similarly narrow view of their state dilution rem-
edy.287  The same strangulation  of dilution took place in  New
York.288  Commentators  like  Pattishall  grumbled  that  New
York and federal courts "stubbornly and illogically" read confu-
sion requirements into that state's dilution law.289
These restrictive  readings of dilution statutes were proba-
bly driven  by concerns  about  overshooting.290  Once infringe-
ment escaped from its obsolescence, courts no longer needed di-
283.  See Klieger, supra note 9, at 815-16.  The Seventh Circuit's favorable
treatment of the Illinois anti-dilution statute appears to be  an exception to
this trend. See Polaroid Corp. v. Polaraid, Inc., 319 F.2d 830 (7th Cir. 1963).
This case involved Polaroid's infringement and dilution suit against a refrig-
erator maker.  See id. at 832.  A panel majority (over a strong dissent) held
that the plaintiff was entitled to relief under infringement and dilution (blur-
ring) theory. See id. at 836-37; id. at 837 (Schnackenberg, J., dissenting).
Upon closer examination, however, the case actually supports an obsoles-
cence reading of dilution. The district court in this Polaroidc ase ruled against
the plaintiff because there was no evidence  of actual confusion and because
the parties were not in direct competition.  See id. at 835.  To remedy this
cramped view of trademark protection,  the panel majority used dilution to
buttress their infringement arguments much like courts did in the years fol-
lowing the publication of Schechter's article.  See generally White v. Samsung
Elecs America, Inc.,  989 F.2d 1512  (9th Cir. 1993).  Interestingly, Polaroid
used dilution in this way even though the Illinois statute had never been in-
terpreted by a state court. See Polaraid,3 19 F.2d at 836.

lution to extend trademark protection.  As a result, the applica-
tion of dilution statutes with their extraordinarily broad lan-
guage was now viewed with great skepticism.  Courts therefore
tried to make  sense of dilution in this post-obsolescence  envi-
ronment  by fitting  them  into  the familiar  framework  of in-
fringement.  This inevitably meant reading consumer confusion
requirements into dilution laws even though those statutes ex-
pressly disavowed a confusion limitation.  Violating this most
basic canon of statutory construction (i.e., reading the statute's
text) has been viewed by dilution supporters  as an act of bad
faith.
If dilution is read as an obsolescence remedy, however, the
rough treatment given to the concept during this period looks
much better.  To the extent that dilution was about fixing in-
fringement's obsolescence,  those laws no longer had a purpose
by the eve of the Polaroid decision.  While dilution laws pro-
vided courts with ample room to expand trademark protection
in marginal non-competing  cases,  their continued  application
would lead to overshooting by pushing protection too far ahead
of the legitimate needs of commercial life.
Unlike  other  kinds  of obsolete  laws,  however,  dilution
could not be harmonized with the surrounding legal and prag-
matic  landscape  through  ordinary  interpretive  techniques.
Reading the statute literally, an approach used to deal with ob-
solete banking statutes, would not solve dilution's overshooting
difficulties  because  the literal  text  of dilution  laws  was  the
problem.291  There were also no administrative agencies  avail-
able to have interpretive discretion delegated to them.  In the
end, the only principled way to read dilution was the counterin-
tuitive approach of borrowing the confusion requirement from
infringement doctrine and then applying it to dilution, notwith-
standing the contrary text of dilution laws.292
From the 1920s until the 1960s, the fates of dilution and
infringement were inextricably intertwined.  Instead of estab-
lishing a new model of protection as Schechter intended, courts
used dilution as  an infringement  obsolescence  remedy whose
vitality was entirely  dependent on the status of infringement
law.  As a result, dilution and infringement moved inversely to
291.  See Langevoort, supra note 197, at 715.
292.  This approach could be construed as a kind of "dynamic statutory in-
terpretation."  See ESKRIDGE, supra note 201, at 112.  That theory, however,
contemplates giving statutes broad readings to alleviate obsolescence, not nar-
row readings to avoid overshooting.1008 MINNESOTA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 85:949
each other  throughout this period.  The  next  Part examines
how dilution took on a different, but related, role during an era
when infringement  was basically up to the task of protecting
marks.
V. TARNISHMENT UPON THE RUINS OF CHANGE
This  Part  shows  how  a  new  form  of  dilution-
tarnishment-evolved  from the transitional infringement  test
Learned  Hand set forth in Johnson.  After modem consumer
confusion  analysis  developed,  the  quality  disparity  between
junior  and senior goods became  relatively unimportant  in in-
fringement cases.  Instead, courts gradually used Hand's qual-
ity factor to identify the tarnishment of a mark's reputation as
a harm distinct from confusion.  This makes tarnishment a di-
rect descendant of the approach that helped infringement over-
come its obsolescence.  Accordingly, tarnishment is closely re-
lated  to  dilution's  overall  role  as  the  transitional  law  of
trademark, even though it looks nothing like Schechter's origi-
nal proposal.  Following an examination of the development of
dilution law since the 1960s, this section concludes by articulat-
ing some principles to guide courts in dilution cases.
A.  CONSOLIDATION IN INFRINGEMENT
The Second Circuit turned Judge Friendly's brilliant dicta
in Polaroid into  a holding in  Triumph Hosiery Mills, Inc. v.
Triumph International Corp.293  Triumph presented the ques-
tion of whether either condition specified by Hand in Johnson,
bridging the gap or reputational injury, were still necessary for
an infringement violation  after Polaroid. The court answered
this question in the negative:
The Polaroid summary recognizes that the reach of the trade-mark
beyond its owner's present use depends upon factors which are vari-
able and relative, none of which standing alone constitutes the sole
criterion.  In this, the Polaroid summary is not in conflict with the
Johnson opinion.  For in Johnson, Judge Hand strongly intimated
that the two limiting conditions of the [non-competing] goods doctrine
are  in themselves  not  indispensable  absolutes  but rather relative
variables.294
This  statement  was  a  classic  judicial  sleight-of-hand.
Hand's second opinion in Johnson, in fact, stated quite clearly
that in non-competing goods cases infringement  doctrine "rec-
293.  308 F.2d 196 (2d Cir. 1962).
294.  Id.  at 198.20011 ONE AND INSEPARABLE 1009
ognizes two, but only two, interests on which the [mark]  owner
can stand."295  Nevertheless,  Triumph acted  appropriately  in
casting aside Johnson's more limited framework since Hand's
language on this point did not constitute a holding.
Once  a senior user no longer needed to show reputational
harm in order to get relief, the quality factor in infringement
analysis  simply withered  away.  The  underlying rationale  of
Hand's quality test was forgotten to such an extent that today
courts applying the Polaroid framework find it hard to see ex-
actly how the quality element cuts.296  For instance, the Second
Circuit has recently  explained that "[we have taken two ap-
proaches about the quality of the junior user's product:  (1)  an
inferior quality product injures the senior user's reputation be-
cause people may think they come from the same source; or (2)
a product of equal quality promotes confusion that they come
from the same source."297  In other words, the quality prong is
meaningless; it can be used with equal force to support or reject
a finding of likely consumer confusion.  This simply restates the
paradox of using quality as a part of infringement analysis.298
While  a quality disparity between the junior  and senior user
leads to less potential  confusion,  that same situation  still in-
jures  the  mark's  quality-representing  function  because  the
mark's reputation is affirmatively harmed among those who do
think the goods come from the same source.
Since Polaroide stablished more reliable factors to evaluate
when the mark's quality-representing  function needed protec-
tion, courts quietly put Hand's more problematic analysis out to
pasture.  Yet his effort to lift infringement from its obsolescence
lives  on through dilution.  Tarnishment  is the Hand  quality
test applied with a vengeance.

B.  TARNiSHMENT OUT OF CONFUSION
Although  courts  no longer needed  a sharp  disparity be-
tween junior and senior quality to grant trademark protection,
questions remained as to how courts would now handle trade-
mark claims  involving vastly inferior junior products.  One of
the  first  cases  to  present  the  problem  after  Polaroid was
Chemical Corp. of America v. Anheuser-Busch, Inc.299  This in-
fringement suit pitted Budweiser beer, which at that time used
the  marketing  slogan  "Where  there's  life...  there's  Bud,"
against a manufacturer of a floor wax/insecticide sold under the
catch-phrase "Where there's life..,  there's bugs."300  The Fifth
Circuit granted relief to the plaintiff "both by reason of confus-
ing the source of the defendant's product, and by reason of the
peculiarly unwholesome  association of ideas  when  the word
'bugs' was substituted in the slogan for the word 'Bud,' refer-
ring to a food product."301 Put another way, the court construed
likely consumer confusion (i.e., harm to the mark's quality con-
sistency) and reputational injury (i.e.,  affirmative injury to the
mark's quality reputation) as separate harms that could  each
warrant protection under certain circumstances.302 By identify-
ing these two distinct strands of the quality function, the court
set the stage for the subsequent divorce of tarnishment from in-
fringement.
The  Chemical decision  was  the  centerpiece  in  the  next
critical juncture for dilution law, and the forum was once again
the Harvard Law Review.  This time, however, the catalyst for
change was an anonymous student Note instead of a Schechter
article.303  In a piece entitled Dilution: Trademark Infringement
or Will-O'-The-Wisp, the author set out to "inquire into the in-
terest protected by the dilution doctrine, examine the scope of
protection hitherto afforded it,  and attempt to evaluate the de-
299.  306 F.2d 433 (5th Cir. 1962).
300.  Id.  at 434.  Since the defendant's product was both an insecticide and
a floor cleaner, presumably the defendant did not tell consumers that their
kitchen floors would be made so clean that they could eat off them.

302.  See also Tiffany & Co. v. Boston Club, Inc., 231 F. Supp. 836, 843 (D.
Mass.  1964) (holding that consumer confusion  and reputational injury were
caused by a restaurant's use of "Tiffany," since the restaurant served cheap
meals and placed newspaper advertisements on the same page as ads for "Any
Man's Woman," "Not Tonight, Henry," "The Horror Chamber of Dr. Faustus,"
"Illicit Love," "The Stripper," and "Bozo the Clown").
303.  See Note, supra note 10.2001] ONE AND INSEPARABLE 1011
sirability of expanding protection."3°4  As this effort was under-
taken during an era when dilution was disfavored, the author
had to struggle against many hostile court decisions.305  Never-
theless, the  Note took the  position that  dilution remained  a
useful remedy.
The Fifth Circuit's holding on the injury caused by a junior
user's unwholesome products led the Note to conclude that di-
lution had a legitimate role to play in preventing tarnishment.
As the author described  the problem  in Chemical, "[T]he  An-
heuser-Busch  Company might well  object to  use of its trade
name on inferior products, or on products like toilet seats or rat
poison whose very nature creates associations capable of reduc-
ing consumer  acceptance  of its beer."306  Basically, this state-
ment just repeats Hand's original reasoning for looking at jun-
ior-use  quality.  What the  Note  failed  to  mention  was that
Chemical did  provide  protection  to  Busch  on  infringement
grounds.  The case had nothing to do with dilution.
Nevertheless,  the Note turned Chemical's analysis  of the
second strand of the quality function-affirmative reputational
injury-into a second strand of dilution theory.  According  to
the Note, "[D]ilution threatens two separable but related com-
ponents of advertising value.  Junior uses may blur a mark's
product identification, or they may tarnish the affirmative asso-
ciations a mark has come to convey."307  This was the first and
most influential formulation of dilution's tarnishment prong.308
Yet, as  a careful  examination  makes plain, tarnishment was
actually  descended from Hand's quality test in Johnson.  The
Note took a concept designed to fix infringement's obsolescence
and merged it  with a remedy whose main purpose was curing
infringement  obsolescence.  As  a result, tarnishment does fit
within the dilution framework despite commentary to the con-
304.  Id. at 521.

law).

308.  Of course, the idea of tarnishment was hinted at in the Yale opinion,
but that statement was not given any explanation. See supra text accompany-
ing note 232.
At about the same time that the Harvard Note was published, a district
court in  Massachusetts  independently  replicated  the Note's  analysis  and
placed tarnishment under the rubric of dilution.  See Tiffany & Co. v. Boston
Club, Inc., 231 F. Supp. 836, 843 (D. Mass. 1964).1012 MINNESOTA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 85:949
trary.309  The connection between tarnishment and the rest of
dilution, however, becomes apparent only when dilution is read
through an obsolescence prism.
Although the Harvard Note defined tarnishment as a form
of dilution, many courts continued to use infringement to ana-
lyze  cases  presenting  significant  quality  disparities  between
the junior  and senior goods.310  These decisions  used tarnish-
ment language to support their conclusions and are today usu-
ally cited as tarnishment cases.31'  Courts in these situations
needed tarnishment to extend protection  because  of the para-
dox created by using a quality focus to ascertain potential con-
sumer confusion.  When junior users complained that no con-
sumer  could  possibly  think  that  their  sleazy  product  was
associated  with the  senior  user's  excellent  reputation,  courts
refuted this through tarnishment.  This use of tarnishment to
supplement infringement mirrors the behavior of the courts in
the 1930s and 1940s that used dilution to buttress their hold-
ings in marginal infringement cases.312
Let us look at some of these proto-tarnishment  cases.  In
Coca-Cola Co.  v.  Gemini  Rising, Inc.,313  the  district  court
granted relief to Coca-Cola against a defendant that sold post-
ers resembling the Coca-Cola logo and bearing the words "En-
joy Cocaine."314  The defendant used the familiar argument that
there was not "any reasonable likelihood,  considering the na-
ture of the poster, that anyone could or would be confused as to
[its]  origin."315  The court cited some evidence of confusion, but
309.  See Part II.D.1.
310.  The fluid state of trademark law at this time is demonstrated by Cue
Publishing Co. v.  Colgate-Palmolive Co.,  256  N.Y.S.2d  239  (N.Y. Sup.  Ct.
1965).  Plaintiff "Cue" magazine brought infingement and dilution claims in
state court against the manufacturer of "Cue" toothpaste.  See id. at 240.  The
court rejected the plaintiffs suit.  See id. at 247.  In analyzing the case, the
court treated infringement, tarnishment, and dilution as separate heads of
trademark protection, with dilution referring only to Schechter's proposal.  See
id. at 243.  The point is that tarnishment could easily have developed as a
third component of trademark protection alongside infringement and dilution
rather than as part of dilution itself.  The Harvard Note, however, proved
more influential than the Cue decision.

the heart of its analysis was that the association of "such a nox-
ious substance  as cocaine with plaintiffs wholesome beverage
as symbolized by its 'Coca-Cola'  trademark and format would
clearly  have  a tendency  to  impugn  that product  and injure
plaintiffs business reputation."316 This was particularly true in
Coca-Cola's  case  because  "[t]he  soft drink industry is  highly
competitive.  Many substitute products  are  available, so that
even the slightest negative connotation concerning a particular
beverage may well affect a consumer's decision."317
A more  colorful  example of an infringement  case  that is
now  commonly  cited  as  a  tarnishment  precedent  is  Dallas
Cowboys Cheerleaders, Inc. v.  Pussycat Cinema, Ltd.318  The
cheerleaders, who are known for their lack of attire, sued the
producers of what the court described as "a gross and revolting
sex film"  involving  the  fictional  'Texas  Cowgirl"  cheerlead-
ers.319  Once again, the junior user argued that no reasonable
person  could  possibly  confuse  a pornographic  film with  the
cheerleaders.320  Relying on Gemini and Anheuser-Busch, the
court sided with the plaintiffs and, through tarnishment rheto-
ric, found likely  consumer confusion.321  The panel  explained
that the cheerleaders  had a right to control their reputation,
and "it is hard to believe that anyone who had seen defendants'
sexually  depraved  film  could  ever  thereafter  disassociate  it
from plaintiffs cheerleaders."322  This  association had "a ten-
dency  to  impugn  [plaintiffs  services]  and  injure  plaintiffs
323
business reputation."
Eventually, courts abandoned the pretense that cases like
Gemini and Dallas fit the confusion rationale, and tarnishment
became a separate component of dilution.  Here are some of the
bizarre  fact-patterns  that  have  supported  tarnishment  find-
ings: (1)  the display of the Pillsbury "Poppin' Fresh" character
in various  explicit  sexual  positions;324  (2) the  "Garbage  Pail

C.  BLURRING AND OTHER OVERSHOOTING
While  courts  fashioned  a new  understanding  of dilution
from  the  remnants  of infringement's  transition,  Schechter's
idea of dilution, now called blurring, remained dormant.329  As
we saw earlier, following the reform of the consumer confusion
test, courts pushed Schechter's theory into the shadows as part
of an unconscious yet concerted effort to avoid overshooting the
appropriate level of trademark protection.  Over time, however,
the circumstances  that originally  gave  rise to  dilution  faded
from judicial memory.  What remained were the broad dilution
laws and Schechter's original explanation for them.  This com-
bination enhanced the risk of overshooting.
The revival of blurring is usually traced to the New York
Court of Appeals' decision in Allied Maintenance Corp. v. Allied
Mechanical Trades, Inc., 330  in which the court removed the con-
sumer confusion requirement that was previously read into the
state anti-dilution  statute.331  Plaintiff was a service company
that cleaned  and maintained large  office buildings, while the
defendant was in the air-conditioning  and heating business.332
Although Allied rejected the plaintiffs dilution claim, the opin-

329.  During this period of dormancy dilution statutes were enacted in addi-
tional states to extend additional protection to mark owners.  See Howard J.
Shire, Dilution Versus Deception-Are State Antidilution Law an Appropriate
Alternative to the Law of Infringement?, 77 TRADEMARK REP. 273, 285 (1987)
("[Tihe dilution statutes had very little impact on trademark law for approxi-
mately the first 30 years of their existence.").  Nevertheless, these laws were
quickly eviscerated by the courts in those states.
330.  369 N.E.2d 1162 (1977).

ion argued that imposing a confusion requirement  in dilution
actions  simply  ignored  the  language  of the  statute.333  The
Court of Appeals may have done a more honest job of statutory
construction than its predecessors, but Allied was not particu-
larly sensitive to the broader problems of trademark law.  Res-
urrecting  blurring  at  a time  when  there  was no  gap  in  in-
fringement  protection  deepened  the  overshooting  trap.
Following the decision in Allied, however, courts began to take
dilution claims more seriously.
Periodically, courts make the mistake of applying Schech-
ter's  concept  literally,  and  in  so  doing  come  very  close  to
granting mark owners a  property right in gross.334  One exam-
ple  is Dawn v.  Sterling Drug, Inc.,335  in  which  the plaintiff
owned the mark "Tower of Babble" and over a period of several
years spent a total of $600 on advertising to market a children's
word game with that name.336  Defendant produced Bayer As-
pirin and used the phrase "tower of babble" in advertising cap-
tions.337 The district court found no evidence of likely consumer
confusion, no evidence that plaintiffs business had been dam-
aged, and that the plaintiff had sold only 4000 games in eight
years  of business.338  Nevertheless,  "out of an abundance  of
fairness" the court enjoined defendant's use of the mark on di-
lution  grounds.339  Whether,  under  the  circumstances,  the
plaintiff really deserved relief for a clever alteration of the bib-
lical "Tower of Babel" is highly questionable.  The decision  is
classic  overshooting:  a literal  application  of dilution  that re-
moves phrases from the commercial market for no good reason.
A slightly different overshooting example comes  from the
humorless  decision  of Deere & Co. v.  MTD Products, Inc.,340
where the plaintiff produced agricultural machinery and used a
proud buck as its mark.341  Defendant, a direct competitor, pro-
duced a commercial in which a buck runs away in fear from de-
333.  See id. at 1165.
334.  See, e.g., Wedgwood Homes, Inc. v. Lund, 659 P.2d 377, 382-83 (Or.

apartments and retirement communities).

fendant's lawn mower and a barking dog.342  The  Second Cir-
cuit ruled that, by ridiculing the Deere buck, the defendant was
liable  under New York  dilution law  because  the  commercial
created "the possibility that consumers will come to attribute
unfavorable characteristics to a mark and ultimately associate
the mark with inferior goods and services. 343  This reasoning
comes  dangerously  close to prohibiting  comparative  advertis-
ing. It is one thing to bar junior uses that just wound the repu-
tation of the mark owner.  Quite  a different  situation is pre-
sented  when  a junior  user,  in this  case  a direct  competitor,
employs parody as a way of convincing consumers to choose its
products over a rival's goods.3"  Again, Deere took the language
of dilution literally, and thereby extended trademark protection
too far.  A more coherent framework of analysis is required to
preserve dilution's legitimate function and avoid overshooting.
D.  TOWARD A NEW UNDERSTANDING OF DILUTION
The  foregoing  discussion  of  trademark  doctrine  sets  a
foundation to establish principles for the appropriate use of di-
lution.  Of course, this cannot purport to be an exhaustive list
of guidelines,  but over the past  seventy years  clear patterns
have emerged from the interplay of infringement and dilution.
1.  Transition
The raison d'etre of dilution is remedying systemic obsoles-
cence in trademark protection.  Using dilution as a transitional
force is justified, however,  only when marks take on a signifi-
cant new function due to sweeping economic and technological
innovations  analogous  to  those  seen  during  the  Industrial
Revolution.  The sheer magnitude of the structural transforma-
tion that must precede a revision in the mark's role should clar-
ify  when  dilution  can be  used  in a transitional  fashion  and
when dilution should not be used in this way.  Before the Inter-
342.  See id.
343.  Id. at 45. Deere declined to characterize its holding as either blurring
or tarnishment.  See id. at 44.  Subsequently, Deere has been read as a broad
tarnishment case. See Hormel Foods Corp. v. Jim Henson Prods., Inc., 73 F.3d
497, 507 (2d Cir. 1996).
344.  Pushing the Deere logic a little further, presumably competition be-
tween two businesses that results in the bankruptcy of one would be an ac-
tionable tort.  After all, the bankrupt firm has suffered damages that can be
traced to a specific cause-in-fact (i.e., the competitor).  The absurdity of this
result applies just as well to decisions that turn comparative advertising into a
trademark violation.2001] ONE AND INSEPARABLE 1017
net appeared  on the scene, there had not been a plausible ra-
tionale in recent decades for using dilution as an obsolescence
cure.  The question of whether the Information Age gives courts
a reason to engage in the widespread use of transitional dilu-
tion is addressed in Part VI.
But if dilution extends  protection in situations where in-
fringement has fallen short, what stops courts from simply tak-
ing the more direct approach and adapting the consumer confu-
sion  test  on  the  spot?  This  question  presents  a  classic
jurisprudential  problem.  Many have  argued  that exposing  a
legal fiction like dilution inevitably renders that fiction ineffec-
tive, that "[w]e must not let in daylight upon magic."345  Even if
dilution is revealed as  an infringement  supplement, however,
that does not diminish its value.346  Without such  a remedy,
courts would be forced to articulate a coherent rationale for ma-
jor adjustments to infringement doctrine in the first instance.
This is not necessary  or desirable.  As Cass  Sunstein has ar-
gued, judges  confronting  significant technological  change  are
better off relying on incomplete theories (i.e., minimal explana-
tion) that solve concrete problems while giving future courts as
much flexibility as possible.347  Because of its breadth, dilution
by blurring remains an effective tool for courts seeking to pro-
tect marks during periods of legal uncertainty without estab-
lishing infringement precedents  that could create future prob-
lems.  But this is the only situation in which the use of blurring
348
doctrine is appropriate.
345.  WALTER BAGEHOT, THE ENGLISH  CONSTITUTION 53  (Oxford Univer-
sity Press 1963) (1867); see also HENRY SUMNER MAINE, ANCIENT LAW 24-30
(Oxford University Press 1931) (1861) (describing legal fictions).
346.  Of course, there is a separate question of whether more dilution stat-
utes ought to be enacted once their dependent role in trademark protection is
clear.  Right now, the discussion is focused on how an obsolescence reading of
dilution influences its application by courts.

Foreword:L eaving Things Undecided, 110 HARV. L. REV. 4 (1996).
348.  Other cases that have relied on blurring, but are not clear examples of
overshooting are more properly understood as likelihood of confusion cases.
See Nabisco, Inc. v. PF Brands, Inc., 191 F.3d 208, 219 (2d Cir. 1999); Ringling
Bros.-Barnum & Bailey Combined Shows, Inc. v. Celozzi-Ettelson Chevrolet,
Inc., 855 F.2d 480, 484 (7th Cir. 1988); Hyatt Corp. v. Hyatt Legal Servs., 736
F.2d  1153,  1156-58  (7th Cir. 1984);  Instrumentalist  Co. v.  Marine  Corps
League, 509 F. Supp. 323, 330-33 (N.D. Ill. 1981).1018 MINNESOTA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 85:949
2.  Tarnishment
Tarnishment is the second category of dilution.  As the heir
to  the quality  focus  that aided  infringement  in its period of
transition, tarnishment looks  at the disparity between junior
and  senior  reputations  to  determine  whether  the  quality-
identifying  function  of the  mark  is  substantially  impaired.
Courts need tarnishment because  there will  be situations  in
which the quality gap between the mark users is so wide that it
becomes problematic to find that consumers could be "confused"
as that term is ordinarily understood.  Although there are not
enough tarnishment cases  to draw  any clear lines, at a mini-
mum it can be said that the quality or reputational disparity
between the senior and junior uses must be obvious before re-
lief can be granted.  Few cases will  meet this stringent  stan-
349
dard.
3.  The FTDA Standard of Proof
To illustrate how these general principles can aid courts in
dilution  cases,  let us  reexamine  the vexing question  of what
standard of proof the FTDA requires.  Broadly speaking, there
are two competing interpretations of the plaintiffs burden in a
dilution case.350  Some circuits hold that proof offered on a vari-
ety of contextual factors (which vary from circuit to circuit) is
sufficient.351  Other circuits, however, have held that a plaintiff
must prove  "actual dilution" of a mark through rigorous  eco-
nomic  or survey  evidence  that can  only be  supplemented  by
contextual  evidence.352  The more liberal reading of the FTDA
relies  heavily on the notion that an actual dilution standard
would make it virtually impossible for a plaintiff to prevail.353
Meanwhile,  the latter interpretation  is based on  textual lan-
guage in the statute stating that plaintiffs  must show that an
349.  One idea embedded in the Gemini case probably deserves more atten-
tion.  Gemini suggested that tarnishment was more likely if there were many
different substitutes for the senior user's product.  See supra text accompany-
ing note 317.  Presumably, this is because even the slightest injury to such a
company's mark (e.g., Coca-Cola)  could cause significant shifts in consumer
behavior.  This should be contrasted with companies that have a more exclu-
sive and secure market niche, and whose marks must be harmed  quite seri-
ously before customer preferences are altered.  Whether this contextual factor
proves helpful in tarnishment litigation, however, remains to be seen.
350.  See supra Part II.D.2.
351.  See supra Part II.D.2.
352.  See supra Part II.D.2.
353.  See supra Part II.D.2.2001] ONE AND INSEPARABLE 1019
unauthorized use "causes dilution."354  Moreover, the actual di-
lution standard reflects the traditional hostility of infringement
proponents toward the breadth of dilution theory.
These competing views resonate with important themes of
this Article.  It is true that an actual dilution standard would
impose an overwhelming barrier to dilution plaintiffs.  It is also
true, however, that dilution should be difficult to prove in order
to prevent the "overshooting" of the proper level of trademark
protection.  But, as we  have  seen, there  are times when  in-
fringement  law  becomes  obsolete  and  dilution must be more
readily available as a way of extending transitional protection.
Under  these  circumstances,  plaintiffs  should  face  the  lower
burden of proof created by allowing  claims  to be  established
through evidence on purely contextual factors.  Balancing these
competing  interests  requires  a  subtle  interpretation  of the
FTDA.  A rule mandating a single standard of proof in all dilu-
tion cases would be unwise.
The  best interpretive  approach would hold that plaintiffs
are required to prove  actual dilution unless  special equitable
circumstances  are present, in which  case evidence  on certain
contextual factors  could  be sufficient.  Those  special circum-
stances should be defined in accord with the obsolescence  con-
cerns  that motivated Schechter's  original  proposal  and  have
driven dilution law in the states.355  Since the text and legisla-
tive history of the FTDA offer so little guidance to courts, the
state law background against which the FTDA was enacted is
critical in shaping how dilution should be construed.  And the
evolution of state dilution law suggests that, most of the time, a
high burden should be placed on the dilution cause  of action.
In the presence of infringement  obsolescence,  however, courts
must permit the application of a lower standard of proof so that
dilution  can  fulfill  its  purpose  of preventing  a  substantial
impairment of mark functions.
To some extent, this nuanced interpretation of the FTDA
has already gained support.  Notably, the Fourth and Fifth Cir-
cuit decisions construing the FTDA as requiring proof of actual
354.  See supra Part II.D.2.
355.  Since dilution serves primarily as an infringement supplement, it fol-
lows that a dilution analysis should incorporate all of the elements of the like-
lihood of confusion test. See supra text accompanying notes 51-52.  Not all of
these factors may be relevant in a transitional context, but that will depend on
the circumstances of each transition.1020 MINNESOTA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 85:949
dilution arose in a non-Internet context.356  Since there is cur-
rently no infringement obsolescence  in real space, the imposi-
tion of an actual dilution standard there is appropriate.  Impos-
ing such a high burden  of proof in Internet trademark  cases,
however, may be  counterproductive  if, as the next section  ar-
gues, dilution can have a useful role in addressing infringement
obsolescence in cyberspace.  Accordingly, no circuit has read the
FTDA as requiring an actual dilution construction in an Inter-
net-related case.
Elaborating principles from a fixed past is one thing.  The
real test comes  when these principles  are called upon to ana-
lyze recent controversies in trademark law.  So, without further
adieu, let us jump into cyberspace.
VI.  TRADEMARK.COM:
LOCATION, LOCATION, LOCATION
The  Internet  has  done  more  than  create  boom-and-bust
stocks.  This  Part explains how e-commerce  has given trade-
marks an important role as identifiers of retail location.357  As
marks underwent their latest transformation, dilution returned
from exile to serve its transitional protective function.  In the
wake of dilution's comeback, however,  there are  already clear
signs that the consumer confusion  test is adapting to the de-
mands of the Information Age.
A.  A THIRD DIMENSION OF TRADEMARKS
Although marks are usually studied for their source-  and
quality-representing properties,  they also serve an unheralded
role  as  symbols  of retail  location.  To  see how  the location-
identifying  function  works,  we  must  return  to  the  pre-
industrial world of Spark the Blacksmith.  This will reveal the
principles underlying the current role of marks in cyberspace.

1.  The Storefront Sign
As discussed earlier, a local manufacturer  such as  Spark
might mark his goods to maintain their identity on the shelves
of a local store.358  But suppose that Spark actually owned his
own store and sold his products directly to consumers instead of
relying on a merchant middleman.  In that case, Spark would
not really need to mark his goods, since they would not be co-
mingled with competing products in his store.
Nevertheless, Spark would still need a mark to identify the
location of his store.  A storefront sign is the classic example of
a mark acting as a location symbol.  In the days before  mass
advertising and phone books, a sign was the best way to inform
customers  where  they  could  find  a  particular  retail  outlet.
Through a prominent horseshoe-shaped  sign emblazoned  with
"Spark the Blacksmith," his mark told shoppers exactly where
they could find genuine Spark products.  Just as a mark's qual-
ity function makes it  unnecessary for customers  to  scrutinize
products  before  making  a  purchasing  decision,  the  location
function helps shoppers  by eliminating the need for extensive
window  shopping  to determine  where  a particular product is
sold.
While  the location function has  always  been an  integral
part of marks, it  has not had much influence on the way law-
yers look at trademark protection.  To some extent, this is be-
cause the location function frequently overlaps with the source,
product, and quality functions.  For instance, in the case of a
small manufacturer like Spark, the source and retail location of
his goods would be essentially identical.  Even if Spark's store
was not literally at the same site as his forge, consumers came
into contact with Spark products at only one place.  As a result,
the distinction  between  the source  and retail location repre-
sented by a mark was insignificant.  Location is also generally
not a factor in how marks work in the modern age of mass re-
tailers.359  As long as people can find the location of the local
omnibus  department store, they can usually find any product
they want.  In other words, for many shoppers the "location" of
a product is just a shelf in Wal-Mart.  One could say that marks
still identify the location of a product on that shelf.  At that
358.  See supra text accompanying notes 111-13.
359.  E-commerce reverses this trend to some degree, since websites make it
much easier for consumers to buy goods directly from manufacturers.1022 MINNESOTA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 85:949
point, however,  there is  little meaningful distinction  between
the mark's product and location-identifying features.
These  two examples illustrate a more fundamental point,
which is that modern consumers rarely rely on marks to figure
out where particular stores and products are located.  In its lo-
cation-identifying  role,  marks  convey  information  over a nar-
row area (i.e.,  the range of a sign), and hence their role in as-
sisting  consumers  is quite limited.360  Assume for a moment
that you want to buy clothes from Banana Republic,  but that
you do not know where Banana Republic items are sold.  The
Banana Republic mark itself does not indicate where its store
might be (unless you can see a Banana Republic sign from your
house), but there are many ways to figure out where to go.  You
could ask friends for suggestions;  look in the Yellow Pages; go
through newspaper  ads; or browse the Internet.  But you are
probably not going to hop in a car and drive around aimlessly
until you stumble across a Banana Republic sign.
Stated more formally, the relative importance of a mark's
location function will depend on three factors:  (1) the range of
the mark's location symbolism;  (2) the availability  and effec-
tiveness of alternative  search options; and (3)  consumer expec-
tations about the location a mark represents.  As for the first
factor, a bigger and more prominent storefront sign makes  a
mark a more powerful location beacon.  With regard to the sec-
ond factor, if people have many easy ways to find retail location
information, as is true most of the time, then giving special at-
tention to  the location  feature of marks will  be unnecessary.
Finally, people usually do not make assumptions about where a
store is located based solely  on that company's  mark-unless
they actually see some version of a storefront sign.  Marks like
McDonald's or Ben and Jerry's do not, in and of themselves, tell
consumers much about where their retail outlets are located.361
In the ordinary case, therefore, the limited reach of the typical
sign or billboard, the easy availability of location  information,
and the lack of consumer  expectations  about where particular
360.  Of course, people using other means to find where a store is located
(i.e., the Yellow Pages or ads) do rely on marks to match up the relevant in-
formation with a particular company.  But marks in an ordinary advertise-
ment are identifying a source or a product, not quality or location.  The fact
that quality or location information (or anything else) can be put into the ad
does not mean that the marks themselves are conveying that information.
361.  People might correctly assume that, for instance, a McDonald's  will
not be located next to the local landfill or chemical plant, but this does not
help identify the specific location of a franchise.20011 ONE AND INSEPARABLE 1023
marks can be found render the mark's location function unim-
portant.
Other more  exotic circumstances,  however,  point out the
need to pay at least some attention to the relationship between
marks and retail location.  First, consider the example of res-
taurants at a highway rest stop.  Customers who use these fa-
cilities  are  often  far  away  from home  and hence  unfamiliar
with the area they are passing through.  If hungry drivers want
to find a Wendy's, they have almost no choice except to drive
around  aimlessly  until  they  see  a  Wendy's  sign.  Normal
sources of location information will not be helpful.  There are
no friends around to give advice, and advertisements or direc-
tory listings  describing  a store's  location are  of limited value
since the consumer will not know the local streets or addresses.
Accordingly, when alternative  sources  of retail location infor-
mation are inadequate,  the mark's location function takes on
greater importance and may warrant special protection.362
Next, think about the problems presented by a mark that
does create expectations about retail location.  If a local store is
called "Joe's at 45 Main St.," it is only natural that people will
think that Joe's is actually located at 45 Main Street.  This ex-
pectation  may well lead  consumers to ignore other sources of
information about the location of Joe's.  After all, if there is a
shortcut available from the information conveyed by the mark,
then why should people take the time to look more carefully at
where Joe's can be found?  In that situation, the mark's location
function again takes on greater importance, but this time due
to consumer expectations (whether correct or not) about the in-
formation conveyed by the mark.3 63
As  these examples  demonstrate,  uncovering  the  location
function in action requires considerable effort.  In real space,
this effort is probably not worthwhile.  In cyberspace, however,
the location function becomes quite important.
362.  In this scenario, doctrines designed to protect the source and quality
functions may extend sufficient protection, but that presumption is problem-
atic in the Internet context.
363.  Just as in the prior example, trademark doctrine founded on protect-
ing source and quality information might cover the problem.  In addition, as a
practical matter it is unlikely that anyone would include specific location in-
formation in their mark unless their store was already at that location.  The
possibility that someone else could profit by interfering with that mark's loca-
tion function, therefore, is remote outside of cyberspace.  See infra Part VI.B.1024 MINNESOTA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 85:949
2.  The Website
Domain names (i.e., Internet addresses) are the storefront
signs of the Internet, but the peculiar facts of life on line cur-
rently  give  the  mark's  location  function  heightened  impor-
tance.364  Even though  the Internet  is still a recent  develop-
ment, consumers  and businesses  are  rapidly  turning to  this
new technology to buy goods, engage in financial transactions,
and seek out commercial  information.  To take  advantage of
these  exciting  opportunities,  people  need  to  identify  a com-
pany's  retail location  in cyberspace-its  website.  One of the
consequences  of the highly decentralized structure of the Web,
however,  is that there is still no effective  directory  or Yellow
Pages of websites for the average user.365  As a result, finding
information on particular products or companies can be a chal-
lenge.
A once-common Internet search technique is sometimes re-
ferred to  as "trademark.com."  Most company and brand web
pages are  located at a unique domain name  comprised  of the
company  or  brand  mark  plus  ".com."366   Thus,  if someone
wanted to find Microsoft's website, an obvious first step would
be to try "microsoft.com."  This assumption made sense because
".com"  is  short  for  commercial,  and  companies  customarily
sought  a ".com"  designation  for their domain name.  Accord-
ingly, courts adopted these Internet norms and repeatedly held
that "trademark" and  "trademark.com" were  legally  indistin-
guishable.367  Nevertheless, the assumption that company web-
sites are located at "trademark.com" is often incorrect.  There is
nothing that prevents  a firm from using some  variant of its
mark (e.g.,  msft instead of Microsoft) in its domain  name, or
other top-level domains (i.e., suffixes) like ".org," or ".net."
364.  For a more technical explanation of how the Internet (or Web) works,
see, e.g., Brookfield  Communications,  Inc. v. West Coast Entm't Corp.,  174
F.3d 1036, 1044-45 (9th Cir. 1999).
365.  Such a directory will probably be created someday.  See infra Part
VI.C.  For now, the explosive growth of the Web seems to be outstripping the
ability to catalogue websites.
366.  The suffix ".com" is only one of many that can currently be used in a
domain name.  Others currently include ".edu" (educational), ".org" (organiza-
tion), ".gov" (government), ".net" (network provider), and ".mil" (military). See
Brookfield Communications,I nc., 174 F.3d at 1044.
367.  E.g.,  Sporty's Farm L.L.C. v. Sportsman's  Mkt. Inc., 202  F.3d 489,

ship Servs., Ltd. v. Epix Inc., 184 F.3d 1107, 1110 (9th Cir. 1999); Brookfield
Communications, Inc., 174 F.3d at 1055 (collecting authorities).20011 ONE AND INSEPARABLE 1025
If "trademark.com" fails to locate the relevant information,
then Internet users can turn to a search engine or a hierarchi-
cal index.  A search engine is software that searches the Inter-
net for  particular  websites  based  on the  parameters  of the
search.368  An intrepid consumer  that puts Microsoft  or some
related term into the search engine, however, may well obtain a
large list of websites that is "likely to deter web browsers from
searching for [a]  particular website."369  This is because search
engines work by looking for sites that frequently use key words
in a particular search request.  To find Microsoft, a search en-
gine will retrieve  a list of sites that repeatedly use words  re-
lated to Microsoft  in their text and in background  code,  also
called metatags.
Metatags, which cannot be seen by web page users, are put
into sites in order to make the site more  accessible to search
engines.370  Due to the enormous number of Internet sites and
the relatively crude (or unfamiliar) state of search technology,
search engines are still a relatively blunt instrument.  In some
cases, it will be easy to determine which item on a search en-
gine list is actually Microsoft's web page.  But the search proc-
ess often requires  a user to wade through many different web-
sites before the correct location becomes clear.371
Under these circumstances,  the importance  of the mark's
location function in assisting consumers  on the Internet is ob-
vious.  First, a domain name address identifies a company's re-
tail location throughout all of cyberspace.  Unlike an ordinary
storefront sign, which is effective  only within a limited line of
sight, domain names have an unlimited reach within the realm
of cyberspace.372  As a result, a mark's ability to convey location
information on the Internet is much more potent than in "brick
and mortar" space.373  Second, consumers currently expect that

tions, Inc., 174 F.3d at 1045; Nathenson, supra note 25, at 60-65.

372.  This is an illustration of the importance of "architecture" in shaping
the regulation of cyberspace.  See LAWRENCE LESSIG, CODE AND OTHER LAWS
OF CYBERSPACE 30-42 (1999).
373.  "Brick and mortar" refers to traditional stores that occupy physical
space.  In a certain sense, there is analogy between the greater scope the
Internet has given to the mark's location role and the wider range mass mar-1026 MINNESOTA LAW REVIEW [Vol.  85:949
a  particular company's website  will be at "trademark.com." 374
In  line  with the  earlier  analysis, this  strong  consumer  pre-
sumption  that  the  mark  actually  identifies  retail  location
makes  that  function  more  important.375  Third,  alternative
Internet search options are still somewhat limited, a factor that
is inversely related to the strength of the location function.  As
mentioned earlier, there is still no directory of web pages akin
to the Yellow Pages, and search engine technology still cannot
effectively isolate specific websites for the average user.
Search  engines  as  currently  constituted  also  depend  on
marks  as keywords to help locate websites.376  Thus, the effec-
tiveness of Internet search technology  itself can be influenced
by actions that substantially impair the mark's location finc-
tion.  This adds a new wrinkle to the simple model presented
earlier.  The prior discussion assumed that the effectiveness of
alternative  search options and the strength of consumer expec-
tations  were  independent  factors  in  determining  the  impor-
tance of the location-identifying  function of the mark.  On the
Internet, however, consumers frequently use marks when using
search engines  precisely because of their expectation that the
mark has  some relationship  to a domain name  address.  Put
another  way, location-function  clarity is  itself critical  for the
primary  search  option-search  engines-to  function  well.377
keting gave to the mark's quality function during the early part of this cen-
tury. See supra text accompanying note 127.
374.  See, e.g., PanavisionI nt'l, 141 F.3d at 1325.  Some have argued that
this expectation is misguided and should hence be treated as "user careless-
ness."  Jon H. Oram, Note, The Costs of Confusion in Cyberspace, 107 YALE
L.J. 869, 873 (1997).
375.  This would not change much if people  understood that company do-
main names might well show up at "trademark.org" or "trademark.net" in-
stead of "trademark.com."  Naturally, this would weaken consumers' assump-
tions about  finding things  at "trademark.com,"  but people  would  still be
inclined to think that a company's mark was an integral part of its domain
name.
376.  This is different from the situation with phone numbers.  A phone di-
rectory does rely on marks to match up the relevant number with a particular
company.  Phone directories or operators, however, are quite precise and can
almost always match a search to a specific number.  Search engines are not
yet this accurate.  In response to a search request, the best they can do is gen-
erate a large list of probable websites, which leaves the consumer in the posi-
tion of figuring out which one is the page he or she needs.  For more on the re-
lationship between phone numbers and domain names, see infra Part VI.C.
377.  One objection is that marks cannot be important both for search en-
gines and for a "trademark.com" search. According to this view, users who fail
to find the website they are looking for at "trademark.com" will not use the
mark as a term in a search engine inquiry.  Thus, at least for those Internet20011 ONE AND INSEPARABLE 1027
Accordingly, the factors that bear on the relative importance of
the location function and the need to provide extra protection to
marks acting in a location capacity blend with each other in an
Internet context.378
These  contextual  elements,  combined  with the Internet's
explosive growth, have transformed the trademark within cy-
berspace.  Indeed, it  would not be much of an exaggeration to
say that the location function is currently the most important
aspect of marks on the Web.  This is, of course, a complete re-
versal of the role  marks  play in brick-and-mortar  commerce.
The  next section  examines  the implications  of this paradigm
shift for trademark law and shows how dilution and infringe-
ment have responded in their familiar fashion.
B.  APPLYING LOCATION: CYBERSQUATTING AND METATAGS
Cybersquatting and metatag abuse are two impairments of
the mark's location  symbolism that have  drawn considerable
attention.  Obsolete consumer confusion law initially led courts
and commentators to  use dilution  as a way of protecting the
mark's newly enhanced  location function.  Within just a few
years, however, the scope of consumer confusion has expanded
to such  an extent that  dilution may no longer be  needed to
safeguard the special role of marks on the Web.
users who conduct "trademark.com" searches before turning to search engines,
the location function is of limited importance for effective search engines.
There is some truth to this observation, but as more domain name suffixes
are  developed  for  commercial  use  (e.g.,  ".aero,"  ".biz,"  ".coop,"  ".info,"
".museum," ".name," and ".pro") over the next few years, the "trademark.com"
method of searching will become very unreliable.  See Ariana Eunjung Cha,
New Web Domains Provoke .deja vu: Suffix Expansion Starts Address Grab,
WASH. POST, Nov. 18, 2000, at El. Under those circumstances, search engine
inquiries will become even more important because there will be no other ef-
fective method for finding websites except by plugging in some variant of the
company's mark into a search engine.
378.  The most critical variable is almost certainly consumer expectations.
If people did not instinctively link marks and domain names, then the impor-
tance of the marlks location function would shrink considerably.  After all, in
brick-and-mortar space people do not normally make that association.  On the
other hand, expectations do not develop out of thin air. People commonly refer
to the new Internet economy as the "dot.coms" because most companies are, in
fact, located at a "trademark.com" address.  Figuring out which came first-
the consumer expectation or the facts upon which the expectation is based-is
a headache best left to someone else.1028 MINNESOTA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 85:949
1.  Cybersquatting
Cybersquatting  is  the  clearest  example  of a  substantial
impairment of the location function.  This involves the registra-
tion of another's mark as a domain name by third-parties who
then seek to sell the name  back to the senior user.  Until re-
cently, domain names could be obtained only from Network So-
lutions,  Inc.  (NSI),  a private company that dispensed  names
under  an  exclusive  contract  with  the  federal  government.379
NSI granted domain names for a nominal fee on a first-come,
first-serve basis, and generally did not inquire into whether a
given request would conflict with existing marks.380  As a result
of this regulatory  failure,  so-called  "cybersquatters"  acquired
valuable trademark rights at the expense of the mark owner.
More  important,  by  taking  the  location  that  consumers
think the senior user should occupy, cybersquatters obviously
make  it  difficult  for  consumers  and  search  engines  to  use
marks as a reliable symbol of retail location.  First, cybersquat-
ters  render  the  "trademark.com"  approach  to  searching  the
Web unworkable by undermining consumer expectations about
the location information conveyed by marks.  When those same
consumers turn to a search engine for help, cybersquatting cre-
ates mischief by making it more difficult to distinguish the real
"trademark.com" from the cybersquatter.  To the extent that a
search  engine looks for pages identified by a particular mark,
web pages with similar domain names just crowd the field and
cause additional delays in finding the correct web page.381
Notwithstanding the problems  created by cybersquatting,
infringement  did not initially offer mark owners  a remedy.382
379.  See Avery Dennison Corp. v. Sumpton,  189 F.3d 868, 872 (9th Cir.
1999).  In 1999, a new competitive scheme of domain name allocation was im-
plemented. Id. at 872 n.1.
380.  See Brookfield Communications, Inc. v. West Coast Entm't Corp., 174
F.3d 1036, 1044 (9th Cir. 1999) (stating that NSI did not check whether its
registrants have any right to use a particular domain name).
381.  One could say that the resulting delays in finding the correct web page
are not significant enough to warrant special protection.  In this early stage of
the Internet's development, however, the costs of such delays may be high.
382.  Many have argued that cybersquatting is not a problem at all.  If a
junior user registers a  "trademark.com" before  the mark owner does,  then
perhaps that junior user should reap the rewards.  A mark owner could, as
many have, just buy the domain name from the cybersquatter and make eve-
ryone better off. Establishing a first-in-time rule for domain names could en-
courage the development of cyberspace by minimizing litigation and forcing
mark owners to claim their space on the Internet sooner rather than later.
While this argument is intriguing, there are two obstacles.  First, the law20011 ONE AND INSEPARABLE 1029
The  problem  was  that  infringement  doctrine  assumed  that
there could be no potential consumer confusion unless the jun-
ior user actually sold something.383  Such a requirement made
sense because, before the Internet, there was no reason to be-
lieve  that a junior user would  take  another  company's  mark
unless it  sold something and could therefore profit from using
the mark.  Limiting infringement protection to cases where the
junior user sells goods, however, is now just as obsolete as the
common-law  rule  that once  restricted infringement  relief to
situations where a junior user directly competed with a mark
owner.  Once the primary value of the mark inheres to its loca-
tion function, however, someone does not need to sell things to
profit from another's mark.  A cybersquatter can ransom a do-
main name  since consumers  expect a particular company's to
be at that address and cannot easily find the web page by other
means.
In the face of infringement's  obsolescence on this question,
courts  once  again  turned  to  dilution  as  a way  of protecting
marks  during their transformative  phase.384  The  passage  of
the  FTDA  in  1995, just  as  e-commerce  was  getting off the
ground, may have been more than a coincidence.  In a state-
ment that many courts have cited, Senator  Leahy commented
during the FTDA debate that "i]t  is my hope  that this anti-
dilution statute can help stem the use of deceptive Internet ad-
dresses taken by those who are choosing marks that are associ-
ated with the products  and reputations  of others."385  Because
of dilution's breadth, courts have found it  pretty easy to  con-
has unequivocally rejected this view, as this Part explains, second, when the
bargaining for a domain name involves only two parties-the senior user and
the cybersquatter-the resulting "bilateral monopoly" generates high transac-
tion costs.  See RICHARD A. POSNER, ECONOMIC ANALYSIS OF LAW 61-62 (4th
ed. 1992).  This may make it difficult for effective contractual solutions to de-
velop.
383.  See 15 U.S.C. §§ 1114(1)(a), 1125(a)(1) (1994); Duffey, supra note 15,
at 147.  Of course, if a junior user acquired a senior user's "trademark.com"
and started selling goods there, courts could easily use traditional source and
quality confusion to enjoin the junior use.  See Brookfield Communications,
Inc., 174 F.3d at 1054-61.
384.  See, e.g.,  Panavision Int'l L.P. v. Toeppen,  141 F.3d 1316 (9th Cir.
1998);  Jews for Jesus v. Brodsky, 993 F. Supp. 282  (D.N.J. 1998); Teletech
Customer Care Management, Inc. v. Tele-Tech Co., 977 F. Supp. 1407 (C.D.
Cal. 1997); Intermatic, Inc. v. Toeppen,  947 F. Supp. 1227 (N.D. Il.  1996);

ment of Sen. Leahy).  Admittedly, Leahy was the only Senator who expressed
any interest in how dilution would regulate cyberspace.1030 MINNESOTA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 85:949
struct a theory of how cybersquatting dilutes a mark's selling
power.386  As  the Ninth Circuit has said, "[P]otential custom-
ers..,  will be discouraged if they cannot find [a] web page by
typing  in  [trademark.com],  but  are  instead  forced  to  wade
though  hundreds  of websites.  This  dilutes  the value  of [a]
trademark."387  Nevertheless,  we  should not  be misled  as  to
what was going on.  Courts were using dilution to protect the
mark's  location  function  because  infringement  was  obsolete.
Moreover, it should be noted that this development would have
been impossible had the FTDA been read to incorporate an "ac-
tual dilution" standard of proof.
Although there  are indications that the common law was
moving  to  expand  infringement  to  cover  cybersquatting,  the
passage  of the Anti-cybersquatting  Consumer  Protection  Act
(ACPA) in 1999 resolved infringement's temporary obsolescence
and effectively eliminated dilution's role in this context.388  The
statute was designed to remedy a specific problem, but it  also
works a significant change in confusion doctrine by eliminating
the requirement that a junior user actually sell products before
being held liable for trademark infringement.  The ACPA pro-
vides, in pertinent part,
A person shall be liable in a civil action by the owner of a mark,... if,
without regard to the goods or services of the parties, that person-
(i) has a bad faith intent to profit from that mark,... ; and
(iir)eg isters, traffics in, or uses a domain name that-in the case of a
mark that is distinctive  at the time  of registration  of the domain
name, is identical or confusingly similar to that mark; in the case of a
386.  There are some difficulties in using dilution for cybersquatting.  First,
the FTDA requires that the junior use be "commercial" to receive protection.
If cybersquatters did not sell any goods, then how could their actions be com-
mercial?  Courts answered this question by ruling that cybersquatters were
engaged in commercial activity by seeking to sell the name itself back to the
senior user.  See, e.g., Panavision,1 41 F.3d at 1325.  But see Golinveaux, su-
pra note 26, at 641 (stating that courts have misapplied the "commercial use"
requirement to get at cybersquatters).  Second, the FTDA only protects famous
marks.  What if someone cybersquatted on a non-famous mark?  In practice,
the answer is that all marks attacked by cybersquatters were found to be "fa-
mous," whether they were really famous or not. See supra note 97.
387.  Panavision, 141 F.3d at 1327.  Courts have generally treated cyber-
squatting as a separate category of dilution distinct from blurring and tar-
nishment. See id. at 1326.
388.  See Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act of 1999, Pub L. No.
106-113,  113 Stat. 1501; Sporty's Farm L.L.C. v. Sportsman's  Market, Inc.,
202 F.3d 489 (2d Cir. 2000).  Some British courts have extended infringement
protection in cybersquatting cases.  See British Telecomms. P.L.C. v. One in a
Million, Ltd. (Ch. 1997); Golinveaux, supra note 26, at 670.2001] ONE AND INSEPARABLE 1031
famous mark that is famous at the time of registration of the domain
name  is  identical  or  confusingly  similar  to  or  dilutive  of that
mark ...3.8 9
All  valid marks  will now  receive  protection  from  cyber-
squatters  through a broadened confusion test.  Although the
new statute retains some  dilution language, it  is hard to  see
how  dilution  will  add  much to  the  protection  given  by  the
ACPA's confusion  section.390  In just a few years, mainstream
trademark law has adapted to this part of the Internet's chal-
lenge.
2.  Metatags
A second  aspect  of the new  mark's  location function  in-
volves the abuse of metatags.  Recall that metatags are invisi-
ble codes that are put into web pages to attract search engines.
Given the reliance of Internet users on search engines, unscru-
pulous web  site  managers  have  an  opportunity.  By  putting
numerous  references  in  their  metatags  to  common  search
terms, even if the words have nothing to do with the substance
of the web site, designers increase the odds that their page will
be picked up by search engines.391  One example would be to
put words such as sex or pornography into metatags.  While an
Internet  user  is  looking  over  the  list  of pornography  pages
pulled up by the search, he or she will also see the pages of un-
related  companies with  the misleading metatags.  Along  the
way, the user  may decide  to pause  and buy  something from
them.
Trademark  law becomes  involved when  someone tries to
use another's marks to "stuff' their metatags.  To return to our
389.  Pub L. No. 106-113, § 3002(d)(1)(A)(i)-(ii),  113 Stat. 1501, 1501A.545-
46 (1999) (emphasis added).  In addition to the ACPA, an elaborate interna-
tional arbitration system has now been set up to resolve domain name dis-
putes using similar principles.
390.  See supra text accompanying notes 168-70 (noting the claim by critics
that dilution is superfluous).  Of course, the ACPA uses a "confusingly similar"
standard rather than "likelihood of confusion." See Sporty's Farm,2 02 F.3d at
497 n.11.  Under a "confusingly similar" test, courts usually compare only the
marks themselves and ignore the contextual Polaroidf actors. See Wella Corp.
v. Wella Graphics, Inc., 37 F.3d 46, 48 (2d Cir. 1994).  This does not mean,
however, that contextual factors are irrelevant under the ACPA.  See Sporty's
Farm, 202 F.3d at 498 n.12, 499 (setting forth some contextual elements that
are useful in evaluating the bad faith element in the statute).  Instead, the
ACPA  simply recognizes  that the Polaroid framework may not work well
against the threat posed to the location-function by cybersquatting.
391.  See Nathenson, supra note 25, at 60-65.1032 MINNESOTA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 85:949
Microsoft example, any web  site manager can take advantage
of Microsoft's strength by putting hundreds of references to Mi-
crosoft in the page's metatags.  This substantially impairs Mi-
crosoft's ability to function as a location identifier.  People who
enter  Microsoft  in  their  search  engine  under  this  scenario
might receive thousands of different kinds of web  pages, and
the false web  pages  will probably  contain more references  to
Microsoft than the Microsoft web page itself. At that point, the
Microsoft  mark would  have virtually no  value  as  a location-
identifier.  Accordingly,  unless  something is  done  to  protect
senior users from metatag abuse, their marks will be unable to
discharge their location function on the Internet and consumers
will suffer.  This problem explains why companies are currently
so eager to have "trademark.com" as their domain name.
In the metatag context, the once-controversial  doctrine of
"initial interest confusion" comes to the rescue.  Initial interest
confusion holds that the use of a mark "to capture initial con-
sumer  attention,  even  though  no  actual  sale  is  finally  com-
pleted  as  a result of the confusion,  may still be  an infringe-
ment."392  This  would  seem to  address  the  circumstances  of
metatag abuse quite well.  All the metatag fiend wants to do is
draw attention to his web site just long enough to get someone
interested in buying something.  Clearly, if someone enters  a
search for Microsoft and instead gets a website for comic books,
he or she will not think that the comic book web page is related
to  Microsoft.  Nevertheless,  the momentary  confusion  gener-
ated before the user realizes that a comic book site has popped
up could be actionable under infringement.
Critics of initial interest confusion have generally assailed
the concept  as too  broad.393  But  several  commentators  have

way & Sons, 523 F.2d 1331 (2d Cir. 1975).  Initial interest confusion has been
described  as "a brand of confusion particularly applicable to the Internet."

concluded that dilution is the best answer to metatag abuse.394
Ira S. Nathenson states the case against using initial interest
confusion for metatags:
Initial interest confusion...  is  a weak  hook on which to  sustain
trademark infringement. First, if this confusion ever truly exists, it is
fleeting.  Second, by allowing liability to attach even if confusion as to
the source of the goods is dispelled by the time any sales are con-
summated, it cannot be said that reasonable  consumer expectations
are  being  protected.  If consumer  confusion is  the loadstone  for
trademark infringement, then why impose liability when no realistic
possibility of confusion exists?395
This sounds just like the language of the conservatives  in
the Second Circuit who once argued that expanding the confu-
sion test to non-compete cases would give mark owners an un-
desirable monopoly.396  Attacks on initial interest confusion are
based on the fallacy that preventing consumer confusion is an
end in itself rather than a means of protecting vital trademark
functions.  Nevertheless, it  is interesting that Nathenson, like
Schechter before him, considered dilution an acceptable  source
of protection for the transformed trademark while being unable
to extend the same bouquet to an expansion of the confusion
test.
The only significant case to address metatag abuse gave a
strong endorsement of initial interest confusion.397  In Brook-
field Communications, Inc. v. West Coast Entertainment Corp.,
the plaintiff, a marketer of entertainment information, brought
an infringement action against defendant, a video rental outfit,
that used plaintiff's mark in its metatags.398  Applying initial

F.3d 1036, 1062-65  (9th Cir. 1999).  One might wonder why this court was
able to move directly to adapt the confusion test rather than relying on dilu-
tion to manage the transition.  The answer lies in the fact that the parties in
Brookfield were virtually direct competitors.  See id. at 1056 ("Not only are
they not non-competitors, the competitive proximity of their products is actu-
ally quite high.").  This made it easier for the court to view the case in tradi-
tional "confusion" terms.  Metatag cases involving non-competitors may, how-
ever, still need dilution to support an extension of protection.

interest confusion, the court found for the plaintiff.399  In the
course of its analysis, the court used an analogy that confirmed
the critical role of the mark's location function in cyberspace:
Using another's trademark in one's metatags is much like posting a
sign with another's trademark in front of one's store.  Suppose West
Coast's competitor (let's call it "Blockbuster") puts up a billboard on a
highway reading "West Coast Video: 2 miles ahead at Exit 7" - where
West Coast is really located at Exit 8 but Blockbuster is located at
Exit 7.  Customers looking for West Coast's store will pull off at Exit 7
and drive around looking for it. Unable to locate West Coast, but see-
ing the Blockbuster store right by the highway entrance, they may
simply rent there.  Even consumers who prefer West Coast may find
it not worth the trouble to continue searching for West Coast since
there is a Blockbuster right there.4°
To confirm its finding of initial interest confusion and ex-
tend trademark protection, the court employed the logic of loca-
tion.  This is  a good start for the adaptation  of infringement
doctrine, but what is the future of the location function on the
Web?
C.  BACK INTO THE FOLD
Even though the Internet has witnessed the familiar ebb
and flow of dilution and infringement, there is one critical dif-
ference that bears on the continuing vitality of the mark's loca-
tion  function  in  cyberspace.  Unlike  the  transformation  of
marks  into quality symbols  by the Industrial Revolution,  the
shift in marks brought on by the Internet may be only tempo-
rary.  The main reason that people rely on marks to find web
sites is that alternative  search options are inadequate.  As e-
commerce  becomes  more common and the architecture  of the
Internet becomes  more  user-friendly,  however, finding a web
site could  eventually  become  as  easy as finding  a brick-and-
mortar store. At that point, the mark's role as a location identi-
fier would diminish considerably.
Domain names  may end up looking like phone numbers.
Phone numbers usually do not convey location information, nor
do people expect them to. Any company's phone number can be
easily  accessed  through  the Yellow  Pages  or  operator  assis-
tance.  But this was not the  only way phone numbers  could
have developed.  If directory assistance did not exist, companies
that conducted a lot of business over the phone would probably
have  been forced to  use  numbers  composed  of their mark  to
399.  See id. at 1066.
400.  Brookfield Communications, Inc., 174 F.3d at 1064 (emphasis added).2001] ONE AND INSEPARABLE 1035
convey location information.  This in turn would have led con-
sumers to rely on phone numbers for that information.  And in
some  situations  involving  novelty  numbers,  courts  have  ex-
tended trademark protection.4 1  Nevertheless,  this constitutes
the exception rather than the rule.
While there may be other location function problems in the
years to come, the story of marks on the Internet fits the pat-
tern established by decades of trademark cases.  As marks un-
dergo a radical shift in purpose brought on by new technology,
dilution  takes  the  lead  in  trademark  protection  due  to  its
greater  flexibility.  Eventually,  infringement  catches  up  by
broadening  the definition  of consumer  confusion.  Both doc-
trines are now awaiting further developments.
CONCLUSION
Dilution and infringement are one and inseparable.  Born
out of frustration with the slow evolution of the common law,
dilution spurred the growth of trademark protection during an
era of economic transition.  As infringement gradually emerged
from the shadow  of obsolescence,  dilution went  into a corre-
sponding decline, with only tarnishment surviving as an echo of
the past.  With the rebirth of the trademark in recent years as
an important symbol of retail location,  dilution reemerged to
prevent  the substantial  impairment  of this particular trade-
mark function while the likelihood of confusion test once again
adapted.
This analysis of dilution's role within trademark law, how-
ever, cannot answer the ultimate question of whether dilution
statutes  are  a good  idea.  After  all,  given  enough  time,  in-
fringement  has proved capable  of meeting the challenges  cre-
ated by trademark change.  Indeed, the legal system as a whole
has  been  remarkably  nimble  in the  face  of the  most recent
shock to trademark protection created  by the Internet.  Dilu-
tion, on the other hand, can be easily misused by courts eager
to give mark owners  the benefit of the doubt.  Moreover, as the
case  law  demonstrates,  even  after  seventy years  dilution re-
mains a tricky concept to apply.
In the end, the desirability of dilution depends on our pa-
tience with the common law process.  A world without dilution
would still be a happy one, but the felt necessities of trademark
401.  See, e.g.,  Dial-A-Mattress Franchise Corp. v. Page, 880 F.2d 675 (2d
Cir. 1989) (granting protection to 1-800-MATRESS).1036  MINNESOTA  LAW REVIEW  [Vol. 85:949
protection will sometimes go unmet.  For those who just cannot
endure these brief periods of uncertainty, dilution offers a po-
tential  solution.  Understanding  the  limits  of that  solution,
however, is the only rational basis for dilution interpretation.
