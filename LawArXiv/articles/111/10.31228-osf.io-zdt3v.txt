CONSTITUTIONAL  FALSE  POSITIVES  AND  THE
POPULIST  MOMENT

We are engaged in just such a contest as every generation must
pass through.  In times of quiet, abuses spring up....  The people
suffer until suffering ceases to be a virtue; they are patient until pa-
tience is exhausted, and then they arouse themselves, take the reins
of  government  and  put  the  government  back  upon  its  old
foundation.
William Jennings Bryan  (1896)1
The liberty mentioned in . . . [the Fourteenth] amendment means
not only the right of the citizen to be free from the mere physical
restraint of his person . . . [but]  to pursue any livelihood or avoca-
tion, and for that purpose to enter into all contracts which may be
proper, necessary  and essential ....  [W]e do not intend to hold
that in no such case can  the state exercise its police power.  When
and how far such power may be legitimately exercised with regard
to these subjects must be left for determination  to each  case as it
arises.

brink of war over this dispute in the German state of Hesse.4 As Prus-
sia and France ordered a general mobilization, the  Times stated that
this was "'a bloody drama that is now unfolding ...  and that nobody
will  triumph  in  except  Germany's  enemies.'  5  Fortunately,  cooler
"
heads prevailed  and the crisis was defused.6  Like the Cuban  Missile
Crisis, the Punktation of Olmutz had all the hallmarks of a war but did
not lead to one.
This story describes a false positive, which is something that meets
the  criteria for a  particular  outcome  yet does  not yield  that result.
Perhaps  the best example  of this is a medical  test that indicates the
presence of an illness when none exists, but the concept is not limited
to biology.  Researchers  in  the social  sciences  must also incorporate
false positives into their work to get an accurate view of a phenome-
non.  For instance, a scholar cannot create a sound theory of how wars
happen by looking only at wars that happen.  That would  present a
misleading picture because the study would be using incomplete data
skewed toward a particular  segment of the underlying  pattern.
Constitutional theory is probably  the only major discipline  that
ignores  false  positives.  While  there  is  no  lack  of interest  on  how
higher law is made or interpreted, almost all of those analyses focus
on when  authority is established while skipping over the near misses
and false starts.7  It is understandable that lawyers are more interested
in concrete achievements like constitutional text or judicial opinions,
since they are the reference  points that bind courts.  Taking that ap-
proach  for developing an interpretive  model, however, is  flawed for
the same reason that ignoring the Punktation of Olmutz hurts a war
model-it  omits  key  evidence  and  lets  false  premises  go  unchal-
lenged.  In  constitutional  theory, this distortion is  particularly  acute

that any attack on Hesse by Prussia would be deemed an act of war, France was pre-

because  the set of canonical  events  (or data points)  that academics
and judges usually rely upon is small.8
This Article starts filling that gap by exploring the most powerful
constitutional  false  positive  in  our history-the  rise  and fall  of the
Populist Party in the 1890s.9  Rising from the heartland like a prairie
fire, this coalition of agrarian interests and disaffected industrial work-
ers went from a group of rabble-rousers  to the brink of power in only

terpretive theory on footnote four of United States v. Carolene Prods. Co.,  304 U.S.

ing Slavery: Dred Scott  and Contemporary Constitutional Theory,  14 CONST. COMMENT.
271, 271 (1997)  ("Contemporary constitutional theory rests on three premises.  Brown
v. Board of Education was  correct,  Lochner v. New  York was  wrong, and  Dred Scott v.
Sandford was also wrong.").
9  While  this Article looks at the economic  doctrine implicated by the Populist
false positive, two other essays will examine its influence on the application of the Bill
of Rights to the states and on racial justice.  A theme of all three pieces is that the
reaction against  Populism by  the  legal  establishment  sharply  redefined  the Four-
teenth Amendment  and moved the law away from the goals of Reconstruction.  See
infra text accompanying notes 52-55.
On incorporation, the Supreme Court's decisions were influenced by antagonism
towards Populism.  The  first case  raising a  comprehensive  incorporation  claim  in-
volved the Haymarket Rioters, who were so loathed by conservatives that their appeal
was called  The Anarchists' Case. SeeExparteSpies (The Anarchists'  Case), 123 U.S. 131
(1887);  Kevin  Christopher Newsom,  Setting Incorporation Straight: A Reinterpretation of
the Slaughter-House Cases, 109 YALE L.J.  643, 711-12  (2000).  Likewise, the first part
of the Bill of Rights applied to the states was the Takings Clause-in a case decided
right after William Jennings Bryan's defeat-and this set up an obstacle to any future
redistributive programs.  See Chi., Burlington & Quincy R.R. Co. v. Chicago, 166 U.S.
226, 241  (1897);  infra notes 343-53 and accompanying text.  Before the mid-1890s,
almost every Justice who  stated  a view on pure incorporation  said the Fourteenth
Amendment did extend  the Bill of Rights to the states.  See O'Neil v. Vermont, 144
U.S. 323, 361-64 (1892)  (Field, J., dissenting); id. at 370-71  (Harlan,J., dissenting).
Yet the Justices did not take up this question until 1900, when they rejected the idea
for everything other  than the Takings  Clause.  See Maxwell  v.  Dow, 176  U.S. 581,
601-02  (1900).  The intervening event that caused this about-face was  the Populist
false positive.
On race relations, the Populist Party was the most egalitarian force in the South
between the Civil War and the Civil Rights Movement. According to the famous thesis
of C. Vann Woodward,  it was the response  to the Populists-not the withdrawal of
federal troops in 1877-that led to the disenfranchisement of African Americans and
to the segregation validated in  Plessy v. Ferguson, 163  U.S. 537 (1896).  See C. VANN
WOODWARD,  THE STRANGE CAREER OF JIM CROW 77-90 (3d ed. 2002).  With the foun-
dation laid in this essay, Woodward's argument can be considered in a constitutional
context.  This reversal in federalism  priorities from Reconstruction  (more national
protection for property and less for race) was  part of a  broader adjustment in the
balance between local and federal authority triggered by the Pullman Railroad Strike
of 1894.  See infra notes 169-80 and accompanying  text.

ten years.10  In the course of that decade, the Populists presented one
of the most radical reform programs ever supported by a major party
in a presidential  campaign.1  That agenda was accompanied by a lu-
cid critique  of the legal  order and a claim  that the Supreme  Court
needed a drastic overhaul.12  Love them or hate them, the Populists at
their peak had the vision and the will to remake constitutional lawjust
as the Framers and the Reconstruction Republicans did.'3  The differ-
ence is that the Populists lost the 1896 election and never recovered.14
That defeat did not just prevent Populist ideas from coming to
pass.  A constitutional false positive actually moves the law away from
what the doomed reformers supported.  There is a deep truth under-
lying this assertion,  which  is  that almost  every movement  for broad
legal change triggers strong opposition.15 Since scholars tend to focus
on  the  times  when  the  resistance  is  overcome  and  reformers  win,
those tactics are usually dismissed as stubborn "mistakes" with no last-

1892, which called for fiat money, a progressive income tax, public ownership of rail-
roads and utilities, a secret ballot, the direct election of Senators, and limiting the
President to one term).

suggested their "reversal by the court as it may hereafter be constituted").

Populist ideology, which was, among other things, backward-looking,  nativist, anti-
Semitic, and conspiratorial.  See HOFSTADTER,  supra note 10, at 60-93.
14  Of course, many ideas that the Populists championed were adopted in later
decades, so it is an oversimplification to say that the movement lost. The point is that
the Populist Party never gained power, and hence its unique constitutional  philoso-
phy was never implemented.  For more on the crucial 1896 campaign, see ROBERT F.

defensive  actions  establish  the  baseline  for a  new set  of governing
principles.
This was the scenario that played out in the 1890s, as the Populist
false positive hurled  the law onto a new path that still leaves experts
scratching their heads.  It was in  1897, right after Populism's defeat,
that judges first identified the "liberty of contract" in the Due Process
Clause and  thus began the  Lochner era of greater scrutiny over eco-
nomic and social legislation. 17  That landmark was foreshadowed by a
trio of groundbreaking cases in 1895  that marked the parameters for
federal power until the 1930s.18  The first one concluded, in what one
observer describes as a "stunning defeat,"  that Congress's reach  over
interstate  commerce did not cover manufacturing and therefore  the
Sherman Act could not be applied to the sugar trust.19  Another held
that federal judges  could  enjoin  strikes  to  protect  interstate  com-

(voiding a federal income tax as inconsistent with the Direct Tax Clause); In re Debs,
158 U.S. 564, 599 (1895)  (holding that federal courts could enjoin strikes); United
States v. E.C. Knight Co.,  156 U.S. 1, 16 (1895)  (reading the Sherman  Antitrust Act
narrowly to avoid constitutional difficulties under the Commerce Clause).  This does
not mean  that the  specific  rules  in  these  cases  were  controlling  until  the  1930s
(though the holding in Debs was).  Rather, the decisions symbolize the turn triggered
by the Populist false positive.  Before 1895, the Court never invalidated a federal tax
on constitutional  grounds.  See Bruce Ackerman,  Taxation and the Constitution, 99
COLUM. L. REv.  1, 25  (1999).  After 1895, it did so more than once.  See, e.g.,  United
States v. Butler, 297  U.S. 1, 63-64  (1936)  (voiding a regulatory  tax on agriculture
because farming  was  "a purely local  activity").  Similarly,  before  1895  the Justices
largely ignored the affirmative  reach of the Commerce Clause.  See United States v.
Lopez, 514 U.S. 549, 553 (1995)  (stating that until the late nineteenth  century "the
Court's Commerce Clause decisions dealt rarely with the extent of Congress' power").
After 1895, however, that provision became the focal point for most assertions of fed-
eral power.  See infra notes 104-22 and accompanying  text.

merce, but only after the Justices strained to find the broadest possible
basis for decision.20  Finally, the Court voided the federal income tax
and overturned nearly a century of precedent in a move that William
Howard Taft called one of its biggest mistakes.21 On these issues and
others  that  shifted  during  the  1890s,  scholars  confront  the  legal
equivalent of Planet X-a hidden force that still exerts an observable
pull.  Once the concept of a false positive is introduced, however, the
mystery is solved.  Hostility to Populist values drove these rulings, and
that ire was so intense that it actually altered the Constitution's mean-
ing in ways that still affect us.22
Part I of this Article  looks at the role of resistance  in constitu-
tional law and explains how false positives can reshape doctrine.  Part
II explores  the  roots and agenda of the Populists in an  age of class
division  and rapid  industrialization.  Part III recounts  the mounting
tension  between  these upstarts  and the  political  establishment  that
culminated in President Grover Cleveland's decision  to use troops to
break the Pullman Railroad Strike, an act that transformed the mean-

intervened against  the  Populist  tide.  Part V follows  the  1896  cam-

rated the era of laissez-faire  constitutionalism.
I.  THE VIRTUES OF STANDING ATHWART HISTORY
This Part develops a framework for understanding constitutional
false positives by assessing how opposition contributes to the creation
of law.  There are  some general  lessons that can be drawn from the
efforts  of constitutional  conservatives.23  For present  purposes,  the
main point is that while unsuccessful resistance  can deepen the scope
of change  by forcing  reformers  to intensify their efforts, when  that
resistance prevails it can also enlarge  the scope of a reformist defeat
into what effectively becomes  a new legal regime.
A.  The Power of Negation
The utility of opposition is presupposed by the adversarial shape
of our legal institutions.  At its core, resistance is just another way of
describing  debate.  Aggressive  questioning  of  reform  proposals  is
healthy because it exposes flaws that might exist and stops bad ideas in
their  tracks.  Moreover,  these  criticisms  frequently  improve  what
emerges from the deliberative process.  After all, that is how the Bill of
Rights came into being.  The Framers did not think that these protec-
tions were necessary, but the conservatives of the time-the Antifeder-
alists-strongly disagreed and extracted the first ten amendments as a
concession in exchange for support on the original Constitution's rati-
fication.24  Thus,  it is  vital  for  people  to  give  voice  to  their objec-
tions-not just because  they have a right to speak, but because  they
serve a useful filtering role even if they are in the minority.
Along  with refining  the content  of constitutional  reform,  resis-
tance  can sometimes  alter the mode through  which  those  concepts
are expressed.  In this respect, the Fourteenth Amendment also owes
its existence to conservatives.  The 39th Congress first tried to protect
basic rights and extend  citizenship to African Americans  (and many
Native Americans)  through the Civil Rights Act of 1866.25  President
23  The text is talking about conservatives with a small "c"  (i.e., anybody who is
against radical change).  The title of this Part, however, refers to William F. Buckley's
slogan for The National Review, which is clearly a big "C" publication.
24  See THE FEDERALIST No. 84, at 575-81  (Alexander Hamilton)  Uacob E. Cooke
ed., 1961)  (attacking a bill of rights); GORDON S. WooD, THE CREATION OF THE AMERI-
CAN REPUBLIC 1776-1787, at 536-43 (1969)  (outlining the Antifederalist response and
James Madison's decision to accept that view).
25  See Act of Apr. 9, 1866, ch. 31, § 1, 14 Stat. 27, 27; MICHAEL KENT CURTIS, No
STATE  SHALL ABRIDGE: THE FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT  AND THE BILL OF RIGHTS 71-83NOTRE  DAME  LAW  REVIEW [VOL.  81:3
Andrew Johnson, however, vetoed the bill as unconstitutional and in-
voked traditional principles of white supremacy and federalism to sup-
port his conclusion.26  To overcome  this opposition and  secure the
Act from challenge,  Reconstruction Republicans passed  Section 1 of
the Fourteenth Amendment.27  IfJohnson had signed the Civil Rights
Act, the Amendment we know would not exist.  Instead, its substance
would have migrated to the Thirteenth Amendment or the other tex-
tual provisions  on which  the Act relied.  As a result, the enemies  of
constitutional  transformation  sometimes  alter  its  form  but  not  its
28
effect.
On the other hand, resistance helps burnish the legitimacy of any
change that does occur.  Rules of recognition and procedural integ-
rity do confer authority on the actions of deliberative bodies, but the
more a topic is discussed the more likely it is that people will accept
the outcome.  A statutory provision inserted in the middle of the night
and passed without debate gets the same formal approval in a legisla-
ture as a free-standing bill that is contested for months before passage,
but these acts do not command the same respect.  The airing of griev-
ances that forces  proponents to defend their rationale  leads neutral
parties to conclude that whatever decision is made represents the con-
sidered view of a majority and not the work of a few insiders who are
manipulating  the  system.  Accordingly,  conservatives  spoiling  for a
fight face a sobering prospect-their opposition may end up strength-
ening the mandate for measures they are trying to defeat.29  In other
words, standing on principle  can sometimes backfire.

Rights Act on Native Americans).

27  See, e.g., ERIC FONER,  A SHORT HISTORY OF RECONSTRUCTION  114 (1990).  Con-
gress  did override  the President's veto, but only after the Senate expelled a Demo-
cratic member to get the necessary margin.  See 2 BRUCE ACIERMAN,  WE THE PEOPLE
173  (1998).  This left the Act open  to a challenge on procedural grounds (i.e.,  the
override was illegitimate)  and on substantive grounds, as Johnson's contention that
the Act was unconstitutional gave this position credibility when litigation ensued.
28  The  situation during Reconstruction  was more complex than  the text indi-
cates, because Johnson's failed resistance also ended up enhancing other parts of the
reform agenda beyond what would have occurred otherwise.  See RICHARD A. PRIMUS,
THE  AMERICAN  LANGUAGE  OF  RiGHTS  160-68  (1999)  (showing  how  the  Fifteenth
Amendment evolved in response to conservative opposition to Reconstruction);  infra

29  See 2 ACKERMAN,  supra note 27, at 164 (describing the paradox of resistance).2006]
CONSTITUTIONAL  FALSE  POSITIVES
That risk is compounded by the idea, which is central to an analy-
sis of constitutional false positives, that fierce resistance also polarizes
the  debate  and  leads  reformers  to increase  their  demands  beyond
what  they would  have  settled for initially.  This  behavior  should be
familiar to anyone with experience  in civil litigation, but another ex-
ample from Reconstruction makes the point even better.  In 1861, the
Republican  Party  held  that slavery  should be  abolished  only in the
territories,  as  Lincoln  explained  in  his  First  Inaugural.30  In  1865,
these same Republicans ratified an amendment abolishing slavery eve-
rywhere.31  What explains this dramatic turn?  The best answer is that
citizens  and officials in  the North  were radicalized  by the  Confeder-
acy's  intransigence.  Certainly this was a rational  response  to the  in-
creasing costs of the Civil War, as voters could have reasoned that only
more sweeping objectives could justify those costs.  Yet there was also
an emotional component to this reaction.  Simply put, people get an-
gry when confronted  with steadfast (or what looks like unreasonable)
opposition.  In that exercised state, they begin rejecting modest mea-
sures in favor of more radical solutions out of a sense of outrage  or
from  a desire for revenge.32  Thus, resisting change  entails  risks not
only because it might increase the legitimacy of reform, but because it
often increases the scope of reform.
To capture how opposition can boomerang against its practition-
ers, the best analogy comes from  the renowned war scholar Carl von
Clausewitz  and his  principle  of mutual transformation.33  The Prus-
sian's dictum that "war is nothing but the continuation of policy with
other means" can be turned on its head to show that politics and war

where it exists."),  in LEND ME YOUR EARS: GREAT SPEECHES IN HISTORY  742, 742 (Wil-
liam Safire  ed., 1992)  [hereinafter GREAT SPEECHES].
31  See U.S. CONST.  amend. XIII.
32  One  of the things  that made  Lincoln  unique was his  benign  emotional  re-
sponse that Divine Providence was behind  the opposition for its own  reasons.  See

(2002)  (quoting Lincoln's view  that "'[t]he Almighty  has his  own  purposes'"  and
wondering if "'He gives to both North and South, this terrible war, as the woe due to

CALL OF LEADERS 86 (1994)  (calling mutual transformation  the insight that "[e]ach

also share  a lot in common.34  In both instances, there is a tension
between  the rational  objectives  pursued and the passions  stirred up
for  (and  needed  to  motivate)  the  people  fighting  for  these  goals.
Clausewitz said it was "an obvious fallacy to imagine war between  civi-
lized  peoples  as resulting merely  from a rational  act on the part of
their governments and to conceive of war as gradually ridding itself of
passion.'35  These  emotions  tend  to drive  parties  in  conflict toward
extremes.  The intense  feelings unleashed  by war and constitutional
law escalate because  they are part of a competition  between different
sides  that react to what the  other does.36  Clausewitz  called  this  the
mutual transformation of forces, wherein an act by one side "compels
its opponent to follow suit; a reciprocal action is started which must
lead, in theory, to extremes."37  This instinct to respond with greater
strength  rests to some extent on uncertainty about the outcome,  be-
cause "so long as I have not overthrown my opponent I am bound to
fear he may overthrow me.  Thus I am not in control:  he dictates  to
me as much as I dictate to him."38  Conflicts also escalate because each
camp tries to use just enough force to achieve its goals, and therefore
a cycle of marginal retaliation is likely as they probe each other's re-
solve and challenge  each other for supremacy.39  Naturally, there is a
limit to this principle because eventually one side is overwhelmed  or
capitulates  when  the  costs of continuing  become  too great.  As  the
slavery example shows, however, the final product of this interaction

248-58  (1999)  (using war theory to explain the Clinton  impeachment saga).  These
similarities should not be overstated since one activity involves violence and the other
does not.  Nevertheless, war and constitutional politics are both conducted in an at-
mosphere of high uncertainty.  See id. at 249-50.  Moreover, luck plays a critical role
in shaping their respective outcomes, though in the law that fact is not given enough
recognition.  See CLAUSEWITZ,  supra note 33, at 85  ("No other human activity is so

often looks quite different from the parties'  initial expectations.40  In
sum,  unsuccessful  resistance carries the risk of turning a modest set-
back into a catastrophic  defeat.
B.  False Positives Defined
All of the scenarios discussed  thus far assume that conservatives
do not succeed in their effort to defeat change, but that is not always
true.  Most  of the time victorious  resistance just preserves  the status
quo.41  Yet if the threat posed by reformers is strong and they still fail
(i.e.,  the requirements for a false positive are met), then the process
of mutual transformation  moves in the other direction.  Rather  than
exaggerating the impact of reform, the opposition creates authorities
that state  an aggressive  set of principles  rejecting the  change move-
ment.42  Those actions then remain in place and become the new ref-
erence  points  that  courts  use  to  implement  this  constitutional
"negative implication" as doctrine.
While  anger is behind many reformers'  efforts  to sharpen their
demands in the face of resistance, fear is the driving force for conserv-
atives seeking to stop change.  To borrow another concept from Clau-
sewitz,  in war and constitutional  politics  people frequently overstate
the  consequences  of defeat and fill  "the stage  with  scenery  crudely
daubed with fearsome apparitions."43  Even the most sober lawyers dis-
play signs of panic when their principles come under attack by a new
popular movement.44  Indeed, there is a regular pattern in our higher
law  under which  officials  conclude  that extraordinary  acts  of resis-
tance must be taken to save the Constitution from destruction, even if
40  See supra notes 30-32 and accompanying text.
41  After all, in most situations reform proposals either have little support or seek
to implement fairly minor changes.  In these circumstances, the intensity of feeling
that is  necessary for an escalation  is simply not present.
42  A prior work of mine describes the most powerful act of judicial resistance as a
"preemptive opinion."  See Magliocca,  supra note 34, at 491-510.  Though that cate-
gory is explored in the Pollock decisions,  see infra note 250 and accompanying  text,
one difference between  that case and the  other members  of this select group, e.g.,
Dred Scott v. Sandford, 60 U.S. (19  How.) 393 (1857); Worcester v. Georgia, 31  U.S.
(6 Pet.) 515 (1832),  is that the latter were swept aside in their time because reformers
won.
43  CLAUSEWITZ,  supra note 33, at 118;  see id. at 117  (discussing the concept of
friction in war and noting that most soldiers "tend to exaggerate the bad news").
44  See, e.g.G,.  EDWARD WHITE, THE MARSHALL  COURT AND  CULTURAL CHANGE 960
(1988)  (quotingJohn Marshall's reaction to the rise ofJacksonian Democracy and his
statement that "I yield slowly and reluctantly to the conviction that our Constitution
cannot last").NOTRE  DAME  LAW  REVIEW [VOL.  81:3
that means striking against the insuruents before they assume power.45
In effect, a constitutional false  positive stands at the opposite end ot
the cycle of mutual transformation described in the last Part.46
Continuing with this inverse parallel, just as conservatives can ac-
celerate  the  pace of change  with  resistance,  reformers who fail  risk
triggering a backlash  that can push  the  new legal  equilibrium to  a
position much less friendly to their cause than where it stood before
their movement began.  Ironically, the most successful defenses of the
status quo (measured by the stakes involved)  can still end up chang-
ing the law dramatically.  Since  the main goal of resistance is  to dis-
credit  reform,  conservatives  are  often  presented  with  a  choice
between applying precedent  (even if that means letting their foes ob-
tain some concrete political victories) and recasting the law to ensure
that the  reformers  lose.  There  is  no  consistent  answer  to  that  di-
lemma,  but in  many cases  fear  of defeat outweighs  respect  for the
rules.47  The leading example is  Dred Scott v. Sandford,48  in which the
Supreme Court held that the Republican goal of barring slavery in the
territories was unconstitutional  even though  the precedents  did not
come close  to supporting such a conclusion.49
That kind of judicial performance  indicates how a false positive
can reshape  the  law.  Consider for a  moment  how doctrine  would
have  developed following  Dred Scott if Democrats  had won their de-
bate with  Republicans  in  1860.  In  that case,  Chief Justice  Taney's
opinion would have altered doctrine merely by withstanding attack, as
its distortions forged under political  pressure would have  become a
new fixed point forjudicial reasoning.  In addition, the opinion would
be seen as the new model for courts-a heroic decision that was criti-
cized but then vindicated by the  people, much  as  Brown v.  Board of

CONSTITUTIONAL  FALSE  POSITIVES
Education5° is viewed today.  Indeed, judges in that scenario would not
be stretching matters much in concluding that the electorate had en-
dorsed an emphatic move away from what the defeated reformers be-
lieved.51  And  once  courts  get  shoved  in  that  direction,  they  are
unlikely to change course for years.  The law that then emerges will be
quite  different  from  how  the  background  principles  would  have
evolved if no Republican challenge  (and no Dred Scott) had occurred
at all.
This hypothetical, which closely tracks how the 1890s actually un-
folded, also shows why the exclusion of false positives wreaks havoc on
legal theory.52  The problem is that any acts of resistance must utilize
existing constitutional  text, as there is  rarely enough  time to pass an
Article  Five  amendment  to stop  reform.53  If the  reformers  are de-
feated, judges in subsequent years will apply the principles laid down
by these acts of resistance as though they were normal extensions  of
the constitutional provision's original understanding.  Thus, if the in-
tervening false positive is ignored, scholars will either get a false view
of what the clauses  meant or a negative  view of the Justices  reading
them.  In the example discussed here, the decisions from the Populist
era lead some scholars to attribute values  to the Fourteenth Amend-
ment that are not there, while others wonder why the Court did such
a  poor job  in  preserving  the text's  meaning.54  The  answer  is  that
these judges were faithfully construing the backlash of the  1890s as if
it was a constitutional amendment.55
50  347 U.S. 483 (1954).
51  This happened in an affirmative fashion several times, most notably during the
New Deal when the Court concluded (under duress) that the people were endorsing
a new set of principles based on enhanced  federal and state power over economic
matters.  SeeJAci. soN, supra note 15,  at vi.  (stating that the Justices "confessed legal
error and saved themselves from political humiliation").
52  Though the text refers only to the 1890s, this period is not the only false posi-
tive in our constitutional history.  In 1840, the Whig Party won control of the political
branches and threatened  to roll back the work of Jacksonian  Democracy.  See Mag-
liocca, supra note 34, at 565-70.  The Whigs failed in that effort so quickly, though,
that this period did not see a sustained backlash.  See id. at 570.
53  In  1861,  the  Democrats did try to pass an amendment  that would  have ex-
pressly protected slavery, but this was not ratified by the states.  See EDWARD MCPHER-
SON,  THE POLITICAL HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA  DURING  THE GREAT
REBELLION 59-60  (Washington, D.C., Philip & Solomons 1864).
54  Certainly not all of the distortions  that occurred in this period involved the
Fourteenth Amendment.  Nevertheless,  this is the part of the Populist false positive
that is most relevant for modern constitutional theory.  See supra note 9;  see also infra
Part VI.
55  One point that should be clarified is that this Article draws no normative con-
clusions about the legitimacy of change caused by a false positive.  Without a doubt,NOTRE  DAME  LAW  REVIEW [VOL.  81:3
Accordinylv,  a constitutional false positive is  part of the natural
give-and-take that occurs when sharply divergent phhlosopnles conicte
in a political arena. Just as fierce resistance magnifies  the scope of a
reformist victory, so too does it intensify the power of a conservative
triumph.  The Populist moment witnessed the greatest popular mobil-
ization in our history that ever failed, and a close look at those years
shows how a false positive can warp the fabric of the law.
II.  THE BANNER OF REFORM Is HOISTED
This Part probes  the  background  of the Populist Party and ex-
plains the philosophy that its leaders brought into the mainstream.  At
its heart,  Populism was  an  agrarian  movement  that followed  in the
footsteps of Jeffersonian  and Jacksonian  Democracy by insisting that
the wealthy were abusing  their power  and threatening  democracy.56
Unlike their forebears, however, the Populists responded to this crisis
by  holding that the  government needed  more authority  to counter
the influence  of business.57  In  particular, they gave a new reading  to
the Commerce Clause that made it a strong tool for federal action and
began a shift in how lawyers assessed the reach of Congress.
A.  Discontent at the Grass Roots
Farmers  in  the late  nineteenth  century  sensed  that their status
was  in decline  due  to  forces  that they could  not control.  In  1893,
Frederick Jackson Turner advanced his argument that the frontier was
central  to the American  experience  and  that its disappearance  had
there is  a strong argument that distortions  of constitutional meaning done in the
name of opposing "dangerous" reforms are illegitimate.  Even if this view is correct,
though, the acts of resistance  remain and should be assessed.

ARE WE AT?  59  (Stockton,  Cal., T.W. Hummel Co.  1894)  ("There  is but one party

significant consequences.58  Though this particular view is contested,
Turner's  metaphor  did capture  the reality  that rural life was  in the
midst of a painful  transition  brought  on by  the  Industrial  Revolu-
tion.59  Innovations  in technology  raised  the productivity  of agricul-
ture  and  linked  regional  markets  into  one  global  market.60  That
surge  in available  goods led  to  a  sustained  deflation  in  prices  that
made it increasingly  difficult for farmers  to obtain credit.61  Indeed,
the only way to survive was by mortgaging part of a current crop to buy
seed and equipment for the next year.  This "crop-lien" plan, though,
just served to deepen  the debt cycle  in a deflationary  time.62
Mounting  debts  were  not the  only  problem  facing  farmers,  as
they also found their livelihood increasingly controlled by corporate
interests.  The independent yeoman  of old now depended on banks
for loans, grain elevators for storing produce, and railroads for bring-
ing goods to market.  None of these industries were regulated, and so
all of them could charge discriminatory rates because  they held a sig-
nificant  bargaining  advantage  over  individual  farmers.63  Further-
more,  rural  voters  thought  that  trusts  had  a  stranglehold  on
government and were using that influence to turn farmers into serfs.64
Thomas  E. Watson, the firebrand who became the Populist leader in
the South, expressed these fears in vivid language:
These  Corporations  are  the Feudal  Barons  of this  Century.
Their Directors live in lordly Palaces and Castles ....  They keep

the highest bidder.  Their Attorneys go on the Bench or into Sen-

The  omnipresent corporate  power that Watson described  was  espe-
cially galling because  farmers  adhered  to the Jeffersonian  view  that
they were the backbone  of the republic and that freedom could not
long endure in a commercial world.66
Driven by these economic  and social concerns, agrarian interests
made  efforts  to  organize  through  the  Granger  Movement  and  the
Greenback Party, but these attempts came to naught until the forma-
tion of the Farmers'  Alliance  in the  1880s.67  Initially, this umbrella
organization, which was the antecedent of the Populist Party, avoided
politics and stressed the need for rural folk to join together as a way of
enhancing their leverage with creditors.68  That appeal for collective
action struck a chord, as more than three million people flocked  to
the reform  banner.69  One sympathetic  newspaper  said that "'[t]he
people are aroused at last.  Never in our history has there been such a
union of action among farmers  as now.' ",70 In spite of this impressive
result, Alliance  leaders  quickly realized  that self-help  would  not be
enough  to address  the problem.  They needed  to enter the political
arena and bring the full power of government  to bear.71

CONSTITUTIONAL  FALSE  POSITIVES
To see why agrarian  activists made  the expansion  of federal  au-
thority a central pillar of their ideology, let us begin by examining the
issue that is most closely associated with the movement:  currency re-
form and the free coinage of silver.72  Most farmers rejected the argu-
ment that deflation in commodity prices was the result of technology.
Instead, they blamed a restrictive monetary policy based on the gold
standard.73  That was the basis for Bryan's famous vow that "you shall
not crucify mankind upon a cross of gold,"74 which  Senator William
Allen of Nebraska explained as "'the operation of a shrinking volume
of money...  [by which]  the East has placed its hands on the throat of
the West.'"75  When the Farmers' Alliance held its first national con-
gress in 1889, the platform called for the issuance of legal tender "in
sufficient volume to do the business of the country on a cash system"
and "the free and unlimited coinage of silver."76  So while both planks
sought  to  reverse  the  fall  in  agricultural  prices,  they were  also ac-
knowledging  that  only  federal  action  could  address  the  farmers'
77
plight.
This new enthusiasm for public intervention and collective action
was on full display in the Alliance's position that the best way to deal
with the railroads and other industries was for the government to own
them.78  The most popular novel of the time, Looking Backward, was set
in the year 2000 and described a utopia based on nationalizing  the

mean that aggressive inflation was the best solution.

means of production.79  Though this gave the federal establishment a
greater  role  than was  ever contemplated  before  or since,  reformers
contended "'[w] here a business is so clearly of a public nature that
the individual can only get fair treatment by having the government to
act for all, then individualism  ceases to be wise  and nationalism  be-
comes . . . necessary." 80  The scope of this concept was  never fully
explored, but the Populists would call for a takeover of railroads, the
telegraph, the telephone  network, and banks.81
Driven  by  the  unprecedented  hardships  facing  farmers,  these
proposals reflected a broader judgment that in the industrial age gov-
ernment should secure positive rights and redistribute income.82  Ig-
natius Donnelly, a leading drafter of the Populist platform, dismissed
the idea that freedom consisted only of a lack of restraints imposed by
the state.83  He wondered "' [w] hat is freedom worth to a man who is
dying of hunger?...  Can you keep a room warm, next winter, with the
thermometer at 30'  below zero, by reciting the Declaration  of Inde-
pendence?"' 84  Spurred on by this belief in affirmative liberty, the Alli-
ance made a progressive income tax a central goal and demanded the
phase-out  of corporate subsidies in favor of the poor to prevent the
"governmental injustice  [that] breed [s]  the two great classes-tramps
and millionaires."85  With all of these reforms, the Populists vowed "to
restore  the  government  of the  Republic  to  the  hands of 'the  plain
people,'  with whose class it originated."86

CONSTITUTIONAL  FALSE  POSITIVES
While this was a powerful agenda, in retrospect the major weak-
ness of the agrarian movement was its failure to present a compelling
message  to labor.87 Just as the Gilded Age brought dislocation  to ru-
ral households, industrialization also triggered turmoil in cities where
people struggled to earn a living wage.  Faced with the power of trusts,
workers followed the logic of the times and embraced collective action
through unions.  In an era where labor  law did not exist and firms
refused to recognize the right of workers to organize, violent conflict
between  labor and  capital  was  not  uncommon.88  For instance,  in
1886 alone there were nearly 1400 strikes across the nation involving
500,000 employees.89  That same year brought the Haymarket Riot, in
which anarchists set off a bomb in the center of Chicago in the midst
of clashes between  strikers and the police.90  Thus, addressing work-
ing conditions had the potential to draw new support to a reform coa-
lition.  While the Alliance tried to formulate appealing urban policies,
they had little interest in or cultural affinity with factory workers, par-
ticularly since farmers  saw city folk as the problem rather than as part
of the solution.91
87  Another problem was that the Alliance offered nothing to the growing popula-
tion of recent immigrants.  In a sense, the Populist movement was the last hurrah of
the white, Anglo-Saxon, and Protestant population that formed the backbone of the
movements led by Jefferson, Jackson, and Lincoln.  By the 1890s, though, that group
was no longer a majority and could  not win without allies.  Nevertheless, the Party
rejected opening "our ports to the pauper and criminal classes of the world...  and
demand[ed] the further restriction of undesirable immigration."  1892 Populist Plat-
form,  supra note 81, at 444; seeJoRY,  supran ote 81, at 17.  Even Tom Watson, for all of
his reforming zeal in these years, said "'[t]he scum of creation has been dumped on
us.  Some of our principal cities are more foreign than American....  The vice and
crime which  they have  planted in  our midst are  sickening and terrifying.'"  HoF-

Notwithstanding  these  difficulties,  the  Alliance  and  other like-
minded  groups  formed  the  People's  Party  in  1891.92  A  modern
reader may think it odd that reformers would form a new party rather
than capture  control of one of the existing parties, but the example
fresh in their minds was  the movement led  by the new Republican
Party in the 1850s.  Indeed, Populist activists often invoked the strug-
gle against slavery, as one did by paraphrasing Dred Scott's infamous
declaration on the status of African Americans:  "The oppressed of to-
day are white laborers and mechanics who, evidently, though without
a  Supreme  Court  decision,  have  no rights  which  millionaires  and
moneyed corporations are bound to respect. '93  In 1892, the Populists
nominated James B. Weaver as their standard bearer in the presiden-
tial election.94  Weaver's innovative  constitutional views are the focus
of the next Part.
B.  Populism and the Commerce Clause
The history of the agrarian revolt is well known, but the creativity
of Populist lawyers gets little recognition.  Given the Party's ambitious
agenda, its leaders needed new ideas to sustain  these actions  in the
courts.  On some issues, such as replacing the gold standard or imple-
menting an income  tax,  precedent supported  (or so it seemed)  the
power of Congress to act.95  For other proposals, especially the goal of
nationalizing  industries,  the Party  tried to  develop  a new source  of
constitutional power from existing textual provisions.  The solution of
people like Weaver and Marion Butler, the Populist leader in North
Carolina, was to turn the Commerce Clause into a strong tool for fed-
92  See HUNT, supra note 62, at 38; see also KOENIG, supra note 60, at 83 (calling this
a "political miracle").  In the 1890 election, pro-Alliance  candidates were elected to
state and congressional offices, but this narrative skips over that to concentrate on the
campaigns following the creation of the Populist Party.

eral action.96  Yet the fog of time obscures how innovative this was and
diminishes what became  the most lasting legal  contribution  of that
era.
Weaver framed his 1892 campaign with a book entitled A Call to
Action and  several  articles  that  laid  out the  Populist  platform  and
presented  an  analysis  of how prevailing  case  law  impinged  on  the
goals  of reformers.97  Starting as Lincoln  did with the Declaration of
Independence, Weaver asked if it could "be denied that all men have
a natural  right to a portion  of the  soil" as  part of their inalienable
rights.98  His  conclusion was that this was "as sacred as their right to
life itself" and that "[t]hese  propositions are so manifestly true as to
lie beyond the  domain  of controversy."99  The problem in Weaver's
view was  that these rights  could  not be  exercised  without access  to
credit  and  transportation  since  "they  are  the  instrumentalities
through which  the  natural  rights  of man  are  rendered  available  in
organized society." 00  He was  therefore  troubled by a set of recent
holdings that the Dormant Commerce Clause barred the states from
regulating some goods and services that crossed over their border.l01
Weaver's  deeper  concern,  which  was  shared by other  rural lawyers,
was  that the Justices  were  laying the  predicate  for a  reversal of the
Granger Cases of the  1870s,  in  which  the  Court rejected  a constitu-
tional attack on state laws limiting storage  prices and shipping  rates
and affirmed that states were generally free to regulate business. 02

Weaver  responded that the present state  of affairs  was inconsis-
tent with first principles because the Framers recognized that the nat-
ural right to the soil was "practically inseparable" from the control of
credit and transportation.103  He said that this was why "they incorpo-
rated the  [Commerce Clause]  among other far-reaching  and sweep-
ing provisions"  in the  Constitution.104  And "[w]hatever  may be  the
meaning of this provision, it is certain that the framers  . . . regarded
the power to be exercised as too important to be confided to the dis-
cretion of individuals or left to the control of the States."105  Likewise,
Marion Butler said that the Commerce  Clause should be read more
expansively  due to "the greatest social, industrial and political evolu-
tion the world has  ever seen."10 6  In Weaver's  eyes,  Congress was ig-
noring its obligations by delegating its commerce power to the trusts
and  allowing  them  to "crush  out the inalienable  rights  of the  peo-
ple."1 07  Thus, he said that "the great  object of the Industrial  move-
ment now challenging public attention, is to  restore to  Congress its
Constitutional  and  exclusive  control  over  the  great  limbs  of com-
merce, money, transportation and telegraphy."'08
This reasoning was groundbreaking  at the time because  nobody
else  saw  the Commerce  Clause as  such  a far-reaching and sweeping
provision.  Virtually all  lawyers  learn  that the  clause  was  first inter-
preted by Chief Justice Marshall  in  Gibbons v. Ogden.109  It is also well
known  that the Court paid little attention  to  the reach  of the com-
merce power until the annus mirabilis of 1895.110  In fact, none of the

Though the Commerce Clause began to assume its modern form
with  the  creation  of the  Interstate  Commerce  Commission  in  1887
and the passage of the Sherman Antitrust Act in 1890, the discussion

by imposing punitive  taxes  on them under what he saw as the more

A  great unanswered  question  in  constitutional  law  is  why  the
Commerce Clause became the principal source of federal authority in
the modern  era.  One explanation  is that the sweeping  language in
Gibbons was  rediscovered  in  the  1890s after  being  ignored  for  de-
cades.121  Even if that view is correct, however, that would not explain
why the epiphany occurred when it did.  The real answer to the riddle
is that the Populist Party made the Commerce Clause a centerpiece of
its constitutional philosophy and thereby catapulted that concept into
the legal mainstream.  Weaver's emphasis on the commerce power is
telling in this respect, and more evidence can be found in the debate
on the  Sherman Act.  It turns out that the Farmers'  Alliance was a
leading force  behind  the Act,  and the  Senate  spent time trying  to
shape its commerce  theory to exempt the Alliance from antitrust lia-
bility.122  In other words, there was a nexus between  the expansion of
the Commerce Clause and the agrarian reformers who were carrying a
new reading of that text into the courts.  This would force the Court
to articulate a new commerce theory, though its position would be far
different from James B. Weaver's.
Backed  by  this  new and  exciting  Populist  message,  Weaver  re-
ceived more  than a million votes  and carried five states  in the  1892
election.123  The down-ticket results were even more encouraging, as
Populist governors won in three states and scores of other party mem-
bers or allies were swept into office.124  While the actual winners of the
presidential  and  congressional elections were  Grover  Cleveland and
the Democrats, there was a feeling at the time that the Populists were
poised  to  enter  the  pantheon  of  successful  constitutional  move-
ments.125  As one contemporary pamphleteer stated, "[A]  party which

III.  PRESIDENTIAL RESISTANCE  AND  THE PULLMAN STRIKE
This  Part  traces  the  opposition  to  Populism  from  the  White
House  and  shows  the  process  of mutual  transformation  in  action.
Prior to the  1892  election,  conservatives  did not seem  all that con-
cerned about the prospect of an agrarian takeover.  That all changed,
however,  with  the onset  of the Panic  of  1893, which  was  the worst
economic disaster this country faced until the Great Depression.127 As
unemployment  skyrocketed  to  about thirty  percent,  the  nation  en-
tered "the  annge terrible of American  history between  Reconstruction
and the [First] World War."128  In this charged atmosphere, President
Cleveland chose a strategy of massive resistance to reform, and this led
the parties  to increase  their demands  and reconsider first principles
with respect to federalism.
A.  Grover Cleveland and the Transformation of Federalism
This part of the story begins by examining  the pivotal role that
Grover Cleveland played  in shaping  the dynamic  that culminated  in
the Populist false  positive.I29  On  the  heels of his  1892  victory,  the
Panic gave  the President a rare opportunity to expand his coalition.
By embracing  some  Populist proposals and offering relief to  dispos-
sessed  farmers and workers, he could  have neutered  the new  third-
party while putting Republicans  in the difficult position of opposing
these emergency measures.  Indeed, Franklin D. Roosevelt would use
a  similar strategy  to  build  the New  Deal majority.  Cleveland  was  a
skilled politician capable of pulling this off-he was, after all, the only
Democrat  to capture  the  Presidency  between  1860  and  1912.  The
problem  was  that he  represented  the faction  of the  party that sup-
ported  the gold  standard and  opposed  government  intervention  in

the economy.130  Thus, Cleveland faced a moment of truth that con-
servatives  in  every  era confront:  should  he limit the damage  to his
principles  by joining the popular uprising  or stand fast and risk an
even greater defeat?131
The President was in a fighting mood.  Rather than compromis-
ing with  the Populists,  he decided  that the Panic  could only be ad-
dressed  through  more  conservative  policies.  Cleveland  blamed  the
meltdown on an 1890 statute that ordered the Treasury  to buy a lim-
ited amount of silver and issue notes against those purchases  to pla-
cate  the demand  for unlimited silver coinage.132  Claiming that this
policy undermined  confidence in the banking system,  the President
summoned  a special session of Congress and rammed through a re-
peal of the law.133  Thereafter, Cleveland maintained a strict gold stan-
dard, and when the Treasury's reserves dropped he even called upon
J.P. Morgan to form a syndicate that would sell bonds to wealthy inves-
tors in order to raise more gold. 34
These actions marked the first escalation in the standoff between
the Populists and the establishment.  While Marion Butler lambasted
the President as a "tool of corporate interest, a traitor, and a drunk-
ard," other reformers took a more sanguine view.' 35  Tom Watson de-
clared  that the return  to a pure gold standard was  "'a  God-send  to
us"' because  it would bring conservative  attitudes "'[i]nto  the  clear
light, where  all  honest citizens  can see."''i6 He predicted  that this
would lead to greater polarization that could only redound to the ben-
efit of the Populist Party, as  "'Democrats  who hold Republican  doc-

transformation  in the law.138  By taking stern action  to snuff out the
constitutional movement, Cleveland risked provoking an even greater
reaction  from  reformers  that  would  intensify  their  support  and
demands.
The Populists and their allies responded by seeing the President's
bet and raising it with a campaign  of protests and civil disobedience.
In the spring of 1894, a Populist activist from Ohio, Jacob Coxey, led a
march of unemployed workers to demand action on a vast public jobs
program.139  As  his  supporters  converged  on Washington,  The New
York  Times declared  that this was  a "'Battle  between  Law and Anar-
chy"' and officials rushed weapons and troops into the city.140  When
the  "petition in  boots" reached  the Capitol,  Coxey's Army was wel-
comed by the police with beatings and arrests.141  Protests broke out
in other cities, and "'in no civilized country in this century, not actu-
ally in the throes of war or open insurrection, has society been so dis-
organized  as  it  was  in  the  United  States  during  the  first  half of
1894.'"142
1.  The Pullman  Strike
Without a  doubt, the  most  important  clash  between  reformers
and the President came that summer during the Pullman Strike.  This
violence was the backdrop for the Debs case and helped reshape atti-
tudes  toward federalism.143  In my view,  the reaction  to the strike is
one of the  most underrated  legal  events  of the nineteenth  century.
Like the link between the rise of Populism and the Commerce Clause,
however, this development comes into focus only when the false posi-
tive model is introduced.

man Strike);  infra Part IV.B.NOTRE  DAME  LAW  REVIEW [VOL.  81:3
The strike grew out of a dispute between Pullman, the main pro-
ducer  of railroad  cars, and  the American  Railway  Union led by Eu-
gene V. Debs.  Most of the firm's work occurred  in a company town
near Chicago where  workers  paid rent to  Pullman and bought sup-
plies  from  its  stores.144  Following  the  Panic,  the  company  slashed
wages by more  than  twenty-five  percent but refused  to reduce  rents
and prices for employees who had nowhere else to live.145  When the
workers  complained,  their ringleaders  were  fired.146  This  led to  a
strike that caught the attention of Debs, who called Pullman's interest
in its workers "'the same as the interest of a slave holder in his human
chattels.'  When Pullman  rejected a suggestion  that the strike be
"147 
resolved  through arbitration,  the umbrella union responded by call-
ing for a boycott of Pullman.148  That transformed a local dispute into
a  national  crisis  by bringing railroad  traffic  across  the  country to  a
halt.149  Harper's Weekly stated that the nation was "fighting for its own
existence just as truly as in suppressing the great rebellion.' 5 °
This latest escalation of the constitutional  confrontation created
a legal minefield for the President.  The railroad barons were clamor-
ing for an end to this "attempt at blackmail" and wanted troops sent
into Chicago  "'because  that was the center and headquarters  of the
strike and that, ifs mashed there, it would collapse everywhere  else.' "151
One  problem  with  that plan,  though, was  that the Governor  of Illi-
nois, John Peter Altgeld, was sympathetic to the strikers and opposed
federal intervention.152  Altgeld was a bogeyman for conservatives due
to his recent decision to grant clemency to the Haymarket Rioters.153
Now he raised a large obstacle for Cleveland by claiming that the fed-

eral government had no power to enter a sovereign state and interfere
with  its  domestic  affairs.' 54   Thus,  a  Democratic  President  was
presented with  the argument that federalism, the Party's touchstone
for nearly a century, protected Debs and his cohorts.  Cleveland now
faced  a second hard choice that challenges all conservatives  who are
in the throes  of resistance.  When  their principles faithfully  applied
would give  their foes a victory, what should they do?155
The President's Attorney General, Richard Olney, answered that
question  by ignoring federalism  and  asserting  that  the  Commerce
Clause  gave  President Cleveland  the  power  to  act.  Of course,  this
claim was most ironic  since  the Populists  were  relying  on  the  com-
merce power to back their vision of a more egalitarian  industrial sys-
tem.156  Olney argued  that the  strike  was disrupting  mail deliveries,
even  though the unions had pledged to exempt mail from the work
stoppage. 157  Railroad owners, though, prevented the mail trains from
moving and gave  the Attorney General  the excuse he needed  to ob-
tain an injunction ordering the union to cease its activities.'15   When
Debs refused to comply, the President ordered  in the troops and is-
sued a decree  stating that "[t]hose  who disregard  this warning and
persist in taking part with a riotous mob in forcibly resisting and ob-
structing the execution of the laws of the United States ...c an not be
regarded  otherwise than as public enemies."'159
As workers and soldiers fought bloody clashes in the city, Gover-
nor Altgeld telegrammed  the President demanding an end to the in-
vasion.160  The Governor explained his position this way:
154  See infra notes 161-63 and accompanying text.
155  See supra notes 46-49 and accompanying text.  I do not deny that there was a

exercise of the police power and the preservation of law and order.
To absolutely ignore a local government in matters of this kind,...
not only insults the people of this state...,  but is in violation of a
basic principle of our institutions.161
Consistent with this principled defense of federalism, Altgeld denied
that the federal government had the authority to send troops into Illi-
nois unless  he requested  assistance.162  In making this  claim, he ar-
gued  that  "'[t]he  question  of  federal  supremacy  is  in  no  way
involved;  . . . under our constitution federal supremacy and local self
government  must go hand in hand and to ignore the latter is to do
163
violence  to the constitution.'
The President answered Altgeld's protest with a telegram outlin-
ing his constitutional prerogatives.  He began by observing that there
was a request for assistance by "'the  post office  department that ob-
structions  of the  mails should be  removed,"'  and hence "'[f]ederal
troops were sent to Chicago in strict accordance with the constitutions
and laws of the United States.'- 164  In a terse summary of his analysis,
Cleveland said that his decision was based "'upon abundant proof that
conspiracies  existed against commerce  between  the states."' 165  This
position was backed by voices in the press who called the Governor a
"sympathizer with  riot, with violence, with lawlessness and with anar-
chy."166  While  critics  said  that "from the White  House  down it has
been determined to put forth every effort even to Gattling guns,..,  to
destroy this strike and the laboring people," in the end the strike did
crumble  under military pressure and a judicial injunction.167

2.  A New Paradigm
Though the legality of Cleveland's actions would be tested in the
High Court, it is  worth pausing  here to consider  how the strike  af-
fected the debate on federalism in the coming years.  The first point
that leaps from  the page  is that both sides  in this struggle were  fo-
cused on the Commerce Clause.  It was in 1894 that the modern un-
derstanding  of the  Clause  as  the  wellspring  of federal  power  was
established.  While  the Populists  had  introduced  the  idea  that  the
commerce power served this function, the President's resistance led to
the development  of an  equally revolutionary  alternative  of what the
Clause meant.168  This emerging dialogue demonstrates  the dynamic
quality of constitutional discourse as each camp sought to overthrow
the other though mutually escalating actions.  At the core of the disa-
greement  in  the  1890s  was  the  scope  of the federal  government's
proper role in regulating the national economy.
As  the  Cleveland-Altgeld  correspondence  indicates,  the  more
subtle feature of the Pullman Strike was its impact on the age-old de-
bate  over states'  rights.  Contemporary  observers were  struck by the
fact, long since forgotten,  that the fight between  Altgeld and Cleve-
land was the most serious challenge to federal authority since the Civil
War.169  For the Populists and William Jennings  Bryan, state govern-
ments were  now the  only remaining bulwark  "'against  a threatened
military  government  of the  railroads  and  their  associate  monopo-
lies."170  Indeed, Bryan's 1896 platform made a full-throated defense
of federalism  on the strike issue:
We denounce  arbitrary interference  by Federal authorities  in
local affairs  as a violation of the Constitution of the United States
and a crime against free institutions, and we especially object to gov-
ernment by injunction as a new and highly dangerous form of op-
pression  by which Federal judges, in contempt of the laws  of the

enacted to regulate interstate corporations, a Democratic President and his lieuten-
ants introduced truly 'revolutionary'  doctrines  .... "  JOSEPHSON,  supra note 166, at

VIEW OF THE CAMPAIGN ISSUES OF 1896, at 4 (1896)  (discussing the "railroad strike riots

who will . . .register a prayer for a revival of the spirit of 1860").

States and rights of citizens, become at once legislators, judges, and
executioners  .... 171
Besides denouncing Cleveland's actions for violating state sovereignty,
Bryan claimed  that the President contravened the Guarantee  Clause,
which secures "to every State in this Union a Republican Form of Gov-
ernment, and shall protect each of them against Invasion; and on Ap-
plication of the Legislature, or of the Executive (when the Legislature
cannot be convened)  against domestic Violence."' 72  In Bryan's view,
that provision embodied the idea that local officials are "better quali-
fied  than  the  President  to  judge  of  the  necessity  for  federal
'173
assistance."
Conservatives  replied that this was  an invitation  to anarchy and
that robust federal  action was  necessary  to  protect  property rights.
One  Republican pamphlet  commented  that the Populists wanted to
take "us back to 1861,  when governors were abetting rebellion ....
This country  is not ripe for such another struggle, nor ready  to ap-
prove the doctrine that the Federal  Government cannot fight for its
own life in spite of all the mayors, governors, or sheriffs."1' 74 And sup-
porters  of Cleveland  pointed out that "[t] he great Chicago  railroad
strike of 1894 was anything but a 'local affair.'  It involved the railroad
employees of fifteen states and was, incidentally, the cause of violence
and rioting which almost amounted to open insurrection."175  The At-
torney General went so far as  to say that federalism  was "'a far more
serious matter than the money question, or any of the other questions
now  before  the  people,  grave  as they  all  are."' 176  If the  Populists
would "'do nothing to protect the property ... of the United States

unless and  until the officers of another government request or con-
sent, then we really have  no Federal Government."' 177
The rapt attention given  to this episode altered  the way people
thought about federalism by changing its focus from the protection of
civil liberties  to the protection of property rights.178  In other words,
the leading narrative on states'  rights is that national  action is espe-
cially important to protect racial and cultural minorities from discrim-
ination by states.  This was the lesson from the struggle against slavery
and segregation.  The Framers  of the Constitution,  though, had an-
other  model  in  mind.  They  saw  the  national  government  as  the
greater danger to personal freedom and the states as a more danger-
ous threat to property interests.  As a consequence,  they applied the
Bill of Rights to only the federal government and inserted clauses into
the body of the text that expressly limited how states could regulate
179
property.
The conservative  backlash against the Pullman Strike  reinforced
the older understanding of federalism and diminished the substance
of Reconstruction by presenting a clear example, in conservative eyes,
of a state acting as an enemy of property.180  Moreover, the Populists
and William Jennings  Bryan  promised  that if they  got  into  power
states  would  have  broad  latitude  to  act against  corporate  interests.
Just as the President needed a new Commerce Clause theory to rebut
the Populist view that it granted power to nationalize industry, he also
needed to reassess the relationship  between state and federal author-
ity in response  to the Pullman  Strike.  In  that context, conservative
leaders were far more concerned about the present danger from the
states with respect to property than with distant tales about violations
of individual rights.
177  Id.
178  One demonstration  of just how much attention the crisis received is that the
press used more visual images to cover the Pullman Strike than they did for any prior
event.  See PAPKE,  supra note 90, at 36 (noting that the famed artist Frederic Reming-
ton penned illustrations for a Chicago newspaper).
179  U.S. CONST. art. I, § 10, cl. 5 ("No State shall..,  make any Thing but gold and
silver Coin a Tender in Payment of Debts.  .. ."); id. art. I, § 10, cl. 8 (stating that no
state could pass any "Law impairing the Obligation of Contracts"); see Barron v. Balti-
more, 32 U.S. (7 Pet.) 243 (1833)  (holding that the Bill of Rights did not apply to the
states).
180  That is a central idea of this project, though its relevance will be clearer in the
article discussing incorporation.  See supra note 9.  The Pullman Strike was a leading
event that drove the Court away from applying the Bill of Rights to the states and
toward an interpretation  of the Fourteenth Amendment that stressed the protection
of property fights.  See infra Part VI.A.854  NOTRE  DAME  LAW  REVIEW  [VOL.  81:3
B.  The PoliticalF  alloutf rom Cleveland's Resistance
These  events  were  a dazzling  backdrop  for  the  1894  midterm
elections,  as Cleveland's opposition  to the Populists split the Demo-
crats and created the chance for a new political alignment.181  As Tom
Watson  had  predicted,  the  President's  escalation  sparked  an  even
stronger reaction  from  reformers  that was  straining the  established
party system.' 82  An officer  involved  in  the  Pullman  crackdown  re-
flected the  polarization  of the  age  by declaring  that "'[m]en  must
take sides ... either for anarchy, secret enclaves, unwritten law, mob
violence, and universal chaos under the red or white flag of socialism
on the one hand; or on the side of established government.' ,1,83 The
Populists responded by taunting Cleveland for "bunco [ing]  the coun-
try in  a huge confidence  game,"  and embraced  the  tumult with  the
radical  mantra  that  "to  make  an  omelet,  you  must  break  some
eggs. 184  As  one scholar said, "Populists had reason to forecast that
the Democratic party, caught in the middle as the country polarized,
would be pulled apart-just as  the Whigs had been split by another
polarization  forty years before-and  the country would  be  left with
two parties, Populists and Republicans."'8 5
A vivid example of the fear in Democratic ranks about the Presi-
dent's course of action can be found in a letter from the Party's lead-
ership in  Georgia imploring Cleveland to cease his resistance  or face
disaster.  These experienced politicians told the President that "'[t] he
conditions  of this  State  are  fearful  and  threatening"'  and  fretted
about  "'the  long-continued  delay  in  helpful  legislation  by  Con-
gress." 186  As a result of his refusal  to compromise,  Georgia Demo-
crats were "'rapidly losing strength in this State.  Every election  held
in the State for the past three (3)  months has gone against the Demo-
181  See SKOWRONEK,  supra note 15, at 49 (explaining that Cleveland's actions were
devastating to the party).  This decision was not so surprising because it was  Cleve-
land's conservatism  that enabled him to get elected as a Democrat in a Republican
time.  Moreover, his career was built on a reputation for public moral rectitude and

with  a warning  that "'[e]x-Congressman  Watson,  the leader  of the
Populists, has taken advantage of the conditions, and is speaking over
the State to assemblies never less than 2,000, and sometimes as many

this appeal, responding that he "'hardly  [knew]  how to reply to your
letter'  since "'I am quite plainly on record concerning the financial
question.' "189
Both  sides  emerged  from  the  midterm  election  with  renewed
hope  that they would ultimately be  vindicated.  The  Populists were
pleased because they increased their overall vote share from  1892.190
On the other hand, the main beneficiaries of the disarray in the Dem-
ocratic  Party were  the Republicans,  who have been  absent from the
story so far but now swept into  control  of the House of Representa-
tives.191  Thus, Cleveland's resistance did not dowse the flames of Pop-
ulism.  Instead,  he polarized  the  country and caused  each  camp  to
ratchet up its demands.  One conservative  author suggested a way out
of the deadlock by asking  "[w] hat shall minister to a mind diseased
like  the  Populist's?  Only constitutional remedies."192  The  Court was
about to put its fist on the scale.

nucleus  of this  constitutional  false  positive.  The  progressive  gadfly
Matthew Josephson  once said  that "by a series of fateful decisions  in
1895, with which it intervened boldly in the controversies of the age,
the Supreme Court...  assumed the commanding role in our Govern-
ment.  It was a kind of legal 'revolution'  or coup d'6tat."193 While this

A.  E.C.  Knight  and the Diminution of the Sherman Act
While  the  constitutional  debate  was  raging  in  the  political
branches, the Supreme Court started its assault on reformers in a stat-
utory case.  In  United States v. E. C. Knight Co.,'97  the Attorney General
filed suit against the sugar trust, which controlled ninety-eight percent
of national production.198  He relied on the Sherman Act and argued
that the trust should be divested of some of its assets. This trust was
declared by Sherman himself as one of the two most outrageous mo-
nopolies of the time (the other was Pullman) because sugar was a ne-
cessity of life.199  The issue before the Court was whether the trust fell
within the statutory language regulating combinations that restrained
"commerce among the several states."200  And in a pattern that would
be familiar in the great cases of this era, the Court ruled against the
Populist stance over the dissent of John Marshall Harlan.20 1
194  See In re Debs, 158 U.S. 564 (1895)  (upholding the injunction against the Pull-
man Strike);  United States v. E.C. Knight Co., 156 U.S. 1 (1895)  (holding that the
Sherman Antitrust Act did not apply to manufacturing).
195  The Pollock decision was rendered  in two parts.  See Pollock II, 158  U.S.  601
(1895); Pollock I,1 57 U.S. 429 (1895).

CONSTITUTIONAL  FALSE  POSITIVES
E.C. Knight held that the Sherman Act did not apply to the trust
because  sugar production  was  "manufacturing"  and not commerce.
Chief Justice Fuller said that " [c]ommerce  succeeds  to manufacture,
and is not a part of it."202  While "the power  to control the manufac-
ture of a given thing involves in a certain sense the control of its dispo-
sition  .. .[and]  may result in bringing the operation  of commerce
into  play, it does  not control it, and affects  it only  incidentally and
indirectly."203  This  distinction  came  from  a  Dormant  Commerce
Clause  opinion,  Kidd v.  Pearson2,04 which  held that state  regulation
was  not subject  to  preemption  merely  because  the  regulated  items
were intended for export.205  The Court also expressed concern  that
the line between federal authority and the states' police power would
be obliterated  if a broad definition of commerce was accepted.206
Beyond these formalities, the Court indicated  that its views were
colored  by the  policy implications  of the  Government's  position.207
After giving only a  perfunctory  nod to  Gibbons, the  opinion quoted
Kidd's view  that if commerce  included  manufacturing  then  "'Con-
gress would be invested...  with the power to regulate, not only manu-
factures,  but  also  agriculture,  horticulture,  stock  raising,  domestic
fisheries, mining-in short, every branch of human industry.'"208  In
the Court's view, "' [a] ny movement toward the establishment of rules
of production in this vast country, with its many different climates and
opportunities, could only be at the sacrifice of the peculiar advantages
of a large part of the localities in  it.'"209  That outcome  "'would  be

206  See E.C. Knight, 156 U.S. at 13 ("It is vital that the independence  of the com-
mercial power and of the police power, and the delimitation between them, however
sometimes perplexing, should always be recognized.  .. ").
207  In this respect, E.C. Knight followed in a tradition established by the second
Legal Tender Case, whereby  the  scope of Congress's  enumerated  power is judged
through an explicit or implicit balancing test that weighs the federal interest against
the autonomy rights of the several states.  See Knox v. Lee, 79 U.S.  (12 Wall.) 457, 553

power as a wartime exigency).

once for its definition of commerce.  See id. at 12.  The other reference came when

state or international commerce."  See id. at 15-16.

about the widest possible departure from the declared object of the
[Commerce Clause].,',210
Viewed in context, this was a response to the Populist reading of
the Commerce  Clause.  Indeed,  the discussion just quoted is  a text-
book argument against nationalizing industry, though this reading of
the opinion requires a full understanding of the contemporary politi-
cal background.  Since  the  Court drew  no  distinction  between  the
meaning  of commerce in  the Sherman Act and in the Constitution,
E.C. Knight suggested that there would be constitutional roadblocks to
public ownership  at the federal level.211  Yet the opinion was a shot
across the bow; an overture for the intense resistance that was coming.
After all, the  Court did not challenge  the Populists'  central goal of
nationalizing railroads, the telegraph, or the telephone system, which
were all still commerce under the new definition.212  Likewise, reform-
ers were blas6 about the fate  of the Sherman Act given their prefer-
ence  for direct  state  control  rather  than  regulation.213  Thus,  E.C.
Knight  generated  little  comment  in  the  press  or  in  the  political
214
arena.
Though the Court's criticism of Populism was oblique, the trajec-
tory of the  majority's  thinking was  not lost on Justice  Harlan.  His
analysis of the Commerce  Clause focused on the language in  Gibbons
that supported the power of Congress to act whenever commerce was
affected.215  Refuting the Court's argument on the difference between
manufacturing  and commerce,  he said "it is equally true  that when
manufacture ends, that which has been manufactured becomes a sub-
ject of commerce; that buying and selling succeed manufacture, come
into existence after the process of manufacture  is completed, precede
transportation,  and are as  much commercial intercourse"  as moving

purchased goods.216  Moreover,  Harlan  said  he was "unable  to per-
ceive that [the Act]  would imperil the autonomy of the States, espe-
cially as  that result cannot be attained through the action of any one
State."217  Antitrust regulation was problematic for a state not only be-
cause a corporation could simply relocate, but because an attempt by
a  state  to  regulate  a  trust's  operation  beyond  that  state's  borders
might well run afoul of the Dormant Commerce Clause.218
While Justice Harlan's dissent made reasonable points against the
Court's doctrinal analysis, he also engaged the broader constitutional
debate  by adopting  the  Populist  view of the  commerce  power.  In
words that tracked the reasoning of James B. Weaver, Harlan said E.C .
Knight undermined one "primary object of the Union, which was  to
place  commerce  among the States under the control  of the  common
government of all the people, and thereby relieve or protect it against
burdens or restrictions imposed, by whatever authority, for the benefit
of particular localities or special interests."219  More important, he re-
sponded to the majority's lecture against nationalizing industry by em-
bracing the reformers'  call for action against the danger posed by the
growth of corporate  power.220  Harlan  argued  that these  "overshad-
owing combinations" were "governed entirely by the law of greed and
selfishness-so  powerful  that  no single  State  is  able  to  overthrow
them .. .and so all-pervading that they threaten the integrity of our
institutions."221  Harlan's  comments  were ignored  at the time, but a
few months later critics would be condemning him for espousing radi-
cal ideas from the bench.222
In sum, the first encounter  between  the Justices  and reformers
articulated significant limitations on federal power.  As one might ex-
pect from an initial act of resistance, though, E.C. Knight took a mod-
est step in a conservative direction, as the lack of any hostile reaction
to the decision shows.  Nonetheless, the process of mutual transforma-

Populism was on an escalating path.
B.  Debs  and the Sword of Commerce
The  Court was  not done with  the  Commerce  Clause, for  soon
after  the  ruling  in  E.C. Knight the  leaders  of the  Pullman  Strike
brought their fight with President Cleveland to the Justices.  For refus-
ing  to  obey the  injunction  against the  strike, Debs  and  his  cohorts
were  found  guilty  of contempt  and  sent  to jail.223  The  prisoners
sought a writ of habeas corpus and assembled a crack legal team led
by former Senator Lyman Trumbull, one of the Framers of the Four-
teenth Amendment, and the up-and-coming Clarence Darrow.224  Yet
the Court unanimously upheld the President's  actions and threw its
prestige behind his resistance  to Populism.225
While the din of politics was muffled in E.C. Knight, the advocates
for Debs used sharp language to inform the Justices that if they joined
the opposition that would only inflame public opinion.  Trumbull told
the Court that "' [r] efusing to work for a railroad is no crime ....A nd
though such action may incidentally delay the mails or interfere with
interstate commerce, it being a lawful act and not done for the pur-
pose, it is no offense.'-"226  Meanwhile,  his co-counsel warned that at-
tempting  to  crush  the  constitutional  insurgents  would  only  fuel
"'dynamic social forces until they gather an accumulated and resistless
energy by such compression, precipitatea  n explosion which shall wreck the
social order.'  The Justices were approaching  the same point of no

relatively broad view of the commerce power.  See supra notes 216-21 and accompany-

return that President Cleveland  had faced two years  earlier-should
they join the reformers  and help  modulate  their demands,  or fight
back and risk institutional damage from an enraged opposition bent
on changing the courts?228
What made  that choice  remarkable  was not  the result  but the
breadth  of the ruling  against the  strikers.  The circuit court upheld
the injunction under the  Sherman Act because Debs and  his union
colleagues were obstructing interstate commerce.2 29  Instead of adopt-
ing this modest approach, the Justices rested their conclusion on con-
stitutional  grounds.230  The  Court  framed  the  question  as  whether
"the relations of the general government to interstate commerce and
the  transportation  of the  mails  such  as  authorized  a direct interfer-
ence to prevent a forcible  obstruction thereof" without the need for
any statutory authorization.23'  In essence, the Court responded to the
strikers and  their lawyers  by pulling out its  trump card-judicial re-
view-and writing limitations on strikes directly into the Constitution
for the first time.
This escalation  was  based on the  innovative  idea that  the Dor-
mant Commerce Clause gave the President the power to remove pri-
vate as well as state-sponsored  impediments  to interstate  commerce.
After  noting that Article I,  Section 8 expressly granted Congress au-
thority over commerce, the Court asked, "If a state with its recognized
powers  of sovereignty  is  impotent  to  obstruct  interstate  commerce,
can it be that any mere voluntary association of individuals within the
limits  of that  State  has  a  power  that  the  State  itself does  not pos-
sess?"232  Not only was the answer a resounding "no," but the Justices
offered a fervent defense  of the President, stating that "[t]he strong
for the Seventh Circuit (May 28, 1895),  in Alan  F. Westin,  The First Justice Harlan: A
Self-Portraitf rom His Private Papers, 46 Ky. LJ. 321,  359-60 (1958))).
228  See supra notes 131-32 and accompanying text. The risk of institutional harm,
as opposed to damage inflicted on the substantive principles represented by the estab-
lished  order, became  a very real  prospect in  the  1896 campaign.  See infra notes
322-31 and accompanying  text.
229  See Debs, 158 U.S. at 600.  The Court's course was even more problematic given
that the issue presented was whether there was jurisdiction to hear the habeas peti-
tion.  See Fiss, supra note 19, at 61 ("According to the standard rule, the Court was not
to determine whether the injunction  that Debs had disobeyed was appropriately  is-
sued;  . . . the  only  issue  open  for  review  was  whether  the  circuit  court  had
jurisdiction.").
230  See Debs, 158  U.S. at 600  ("[W]e prefer to rest our judgment on the broader
ground which has been discussed in this opinion, believing it of importance that the

obstructions ....I f the emergency arises, the army of the Nation, and
all its militia, are at the service of the nation, to compel obedience  to

its laws."
This cavalier dismissal of a state action requirement in Debs must
have  come  as  a  cruel joke  to  African  Americans  who  were  being
lynched at the time.234  After all,  a decade  earlier in the  Civil Rights
Cases235 the Court had held that even an express statutory authoriza-
tion under the Fourteenth Amendment did not give federal prosecu-
tors  the  power  to  attack  private  racial  discrimination  in  public
transportation,  hotels,  and  other  institutions.236  The  Commerce
Clause does not contain language suggesting a state action limit, but a
ruling that the negative implication of that text reached state and pri-
vate action was far from obvious and at odds with the deference  given
to  the states  in  cases  such  as  E.C. Knight.237  The  thread that  con-
nected  this new law together was hostility to  the goals  of Populism.
Congress did not possess  the general  power to  regulate  business  as
reformers wanted, but the refusal  of Congress to act did not prevent
the federal government from stopping strikes assisted by sympathetic
local governments.
The reactive quality of the Debs opinion was even more apparent
in its discussion of why an injunction was an appropriate remedy.  Pe-
titioners argued that they could only be punished by the criminal law
and were being deprived of their right to ajury trial through equitable
contempt proceedings.  Indeed, their brief stated that "[n]o more tyr-
annous and arbitrary government can be devised than the administra-
tion of criminal  law by  a single judge  by means  of injunction  and
233  Id. at 582.
234  Ironically, Southern Populists  were trying to stop the growing abuses of Jim
Crow.  See  The Georgia Populists Platform, reprinted in PEOPLE'S PARTY PAPER, Sept. 11,
1896, at 8 ("We condemn lynching and demand of our public servants the rigid en-
forcement of our laws against this barbarous practice.").  Just as their economic de-
mands  ended  up  backfiring,  though,  the  Populist  defeat  would  make  racial
discrimination worse in the South.  See supra note 9.

ited.  Individual  invasion  of individual  rights  is  not  the  subject-matter  of  the
amendment.").
237  The inconsistency between Debs and the  Civil Rights Cases again explains why
Justice Harlan joined the former holding, since he dissented in the latter.  See id. at
58-59 (Harlan, J., dissenting)  (explaining that railroads,  hotels, and public amuse-
ments should be considered state agents because they perform public duties and act
under public authority).2oo6]
CONSTITUTIONAL  FALSE  POSITIVES
proceedings  in  contempt."238  Furthermore,  traditional principles  of
equity provided that an injunction could not issue unless the ordinary
processes of law were not available.239  In this instance, however, state
and federal tribunals were available; even if it was difficult to make out
a criminal case because-and this was a central point of Trumbull and
Darrow's argument-it was unclear that the strike leaders had violated
any law at all.
The  answer  was  an  extraordinary  rebuke  to  popular  govern-
ment-Debs said local juries could not be relied upon to punish peo-
ple  who  blocked  interstate  commerce,  and  hence,  the  ordinary
processes of law were not open.  In the Court's view, "[i]f all the in-
habitants of a state, or even a great body of them, should combine to
obstruct interstate commerce or the transportation of the mails, pros-
ecutions for such offenses had in such a community would be doomed
in advance  to failure."240  Unless federal officials had another means
of enforcing their will, "the whole interests of the nation in these re-
spects would be at the absolute mercy of a portion of the inhabitants
of that single state."241  This new and irrefutable presumption of jury
nullification  is  one  illustration  of how  the  Pullman  Strike  pushed
elites  to rewrite  the  law out of fear that localism  posed a  threat to
property rights. 242
As the opinion reached its climax, the Court used blunt rhetoric
to tell  the country  that Populism  should be resisted.  Debs said that
"[i]f ever there was a special exigency, one which demanded that the

242  See supra Part III.A.2.  In the same landmark year of 1895, the Court held that
juries had no right to evaluate the validity of a law.  See Sparf & Hansen v. United
States, 156 U.S. 51,  102-03 (1895).  When I was a student, I wrote aboutjury nullifica-
tion and was puzzled about why a custom of jury lawmaking that dated back to the
Founding came to an end at that time.  See Gerard N. Magliocca,  The Philosopher's
Stone: Dualist Democracy and the Jury, 69 U. CoLo. L. REv.  175, 209 (1998).  Now I am
persuaded that this was another byproduct of the Populist false positive, as the Court
was influenced by the threat of widespread civil disobedience  to preclude resistance
from juries.864  NOTRE  DAME  LAW  REVIEW  [VOL.  81:3
with clearest emphasis all its allegations. '243  In addition, "it is a lesson
which cannot be learned  too soon or too thoroughly that under this
government..,  no wrong, real or fancied, carries with it legal warrant
to invite as a means of redress the cooperation of a mob, with its ac-
companying acts of violence."244  This view was reinforced in the  Chi-
cago Tribune, which hailed the case as "a notice to all Anarchists and
other disturbers  of the public  peace that the hands  of the General
Government are not fettered."245
Unlike  E.C. Knight, which  garnered  no adverse  reaction outside
of  the  Court,  reformers  vehemently  objected  to  Debs.  Governor
Altgeld denounced the Court for transforming the republic into gov-
ernment  by judicial  decree,  and  said  that  "'[t]he  corrupt  money
power  has  its  withering  finger on  every  pulse in  the  land.' ,,246  He
then lifted a quote from an antebellum critic  of slavery and changed
"Slave  Power" to "Money Power" before  stating that "'[i] t sits in the
White  House  and legislates  in  the  capitol.  Courts  of justice  are its
ministers  and  legislatures  are  its  lackeys.' '247  Debs  asked why  the
Court "'stab[bed]  the Magna Charta of American  liberty to death in
the interest of corporations,  that labor might be disrobed of its ina-
lienable  rights  and  those who  advocated  its  claim  to justice impris-
oned as  if they were felons." 248  The answer, as should be  clear by
now, is  that in  politics every  action provokes  a reaction, and Debs's
challenge  was  the  cause of the  Court's creation of new law  to stop
him.  A writer captured this by saying that "Debs, Altgeld & Co. have
thus  unconsciously  rendered  the  country  a  great  service  by  their
course last year, for it is an immense gain to have so important a prin-
ciple of constitutional  construction definitely settled.''249
C.  The Pinnacle of Resistance: Pollock  and the Income Tax
The final act of judicial opposition came in the Pollock cases chal-

new normative approach  to constitutional interpretation.250  Some of
these traits were in E.C  . Knight and Debs, but they reached their apoth-
eosis in  Pollock.  Not only was  the Court told that its support was  re-
quired  to prevent a Populist takeover, but the opinion made  it clear
that the Justices-or at least a majority of five-were willing to answer
this call in spite of a formidable array of contrary precedent.
1.  Background on the Income Tax
The  Pollock litigation stemmed from  the enactment of a federal
income  tax in  1894.  A legislative  coalition  led  by William Jennings
Bryan got behind a bill imposing a two percent flat tax on corpora-
tions  and  personal  incomes  over  $4000.251  For  the  Populists,  of
course, an income tax was central to their effort to redistribute wealth
and "the most effective weapon against Plutocratic policy. '252  Moder-
ates supported the tax to facilitate tariff reduction while ensuring that
the Treasury had the revenue  to support the gold standard.253  Lead-
ing opponents such as Senator David Hill of New York responded that
the income tax was "'pressed upon Congress by a lot of Populists, So-
cialists, cranks, and disturbers ....  It was class legislation of the worst
kind.' ,,254  When the bill passed, Cleveland was put in a difficult posi-
tion because  he supported  tariff reform  notwithstanding  his qualms

also History of the Income-Tax Law, N.Y. TIMES, Apr. 9, 1895, at 3 ("The authorship of the

[sic] of Nebraska.").

about progressive  taxation.255  In the end, he allowed the income tax
to become law but protested by refusing to sign the bill.256
Though the debate on the income tax was hotly contested,  there
was a broad consensus  that the bill was constitutional.  Only thirteen
years  earlier, in  Springer v.  United States,257  the Justices  unanimously
upheld  an income  tax  imposed during the Civil War.258  Moreover,
the  Court  had  never  invalidated  a  federal  tax  on  constitutional
grounds  despite  many invitations  to do  so.259  These  challenges  all
said that the tax in question was governed by the Direct Tax Clauses of
Article I, which state  that a head tax and other "direct Taxes shall be
apportioned among the several states..,  according to their respective
Numbers.''260  Pursuant to these provisions, a direct tax cannot be col-
lected unless it is divided among the states according to each state's
share of the population.  As a practical matter, this rule would bar an
income tax by requiring that the rates assessed vary from state to state
in order to generate the proper amount of revenue.261
One reason that the Court was reluctant to describe taxes as "di-
rect" was that the original purpose  of the Clauses was to prevent the
taxation of slaves.  In the first case interpreting  these provisions,  Hyl-
ton v.  United States,262 Justice William Paterson, a member of the Con-
stitutional Convention, explained  that they were written because  the
South had many slaves and the North had few, hence "[ t] he southern
states, if no provision had been introduced in the constitution, would

a challenge to taxes on state bank notes); Pac. Ins. Co. v. Soule, 74 U.S. (7 Wall.) 433,

261  This is because income levels vary by state.  Consider two states with the same
population but different per capita incomes.  Since the Direct Tax Clauses require
that each state contribute to such a tax based on its share of the census, each of these
two states would have to hand over the same amount of money.  To accomplish this,
the tax rate in the poorer state would have to be higher than in the richer state, or
else the poorer state would have to make up the shortfall with other taxes. This would
be unfair and politically unacceptable.  Hylton, 3 U.S.  (3 Dall.)  at 174  (opinion of

have been wholly at the mercy of the other states.  Congress in such
case, might tax slaves."263  This reading is supported by evidence that
the Framers wanted  to prevent  sectional  strife by forcing the  entire
nation, North and South, to bear the burden of a slave tax.264  Natu-
rally, the abolition of slavery erased this purpose and rendered these
Clauses a relic no different from the Fugitive Slave Clause.265
Nevertheless,  when a corporate shareholder  objected  to  the in-
come tax and sought equitable relief in the courts, the great conserva-
tive lawyers of the day urged the Justices to give the Direct Tax Clauses
a new anti-redistribution  reading.266  Joseph  H.  Choate,  a leader  of
the corporate bar, took on the case because he feared  that unless he
built "'a rampart around the rights of property,"' Populists would es-
tablish a dangerous new order.2 67  He told the Court that upholding
the tax would be "'the beginning of socialism and communism"' and
would cause  "'the  destruction  of the Constitution itself.'" 268  In re-
sponse to the argument  that the Justices should stay out of the issue
because "opposing forces of sixty millions of people have become  ar-
rayed  in hostile political ranks upon a question which all men feel is
not a question  of law, but of legislation,"269 Choate offered this emo-
tional peroration:
If it be true, as my friend said in closing, that the passions of the
people are aroused on this subject, if it be true that a mighty army
of sixty million citizens is likely to be incensed by this decision, it is
more vital to the future welfare of this country that this court again
resolutely and courageously declare, as Marshall did, that it has the
power to set aside an act of Congress violative of the Constitution,

Constitutional Convention).

templated by the founders of the government");  id. at 687  (Brown, J.,  dissenting)

purpose, that passed away with the existence of slavery").
266  Petitioner was a shareholder who sued to stop a corporation from paying the
income taxes that it owed.  See Pollock I, 157 U.S. 429, 430 (1895).  This looked like a
collusive suit, but the complaint stated that this was  not the case.  Id. at 433.  The

the threatened consequences of popular or populistic wrath may be.270
As Justice Harlan said in his dissent, Choate all but urged the Court
"to stand in the breach for the protection of the just rights of property
against the advancing hosts of socialism."271
2.  The Pollock Opinions
The Justices responded by issuing a set of opinions that declared
the income tax statute unconstitutional.  In overturning  a century of
doctrine, the Court deviated from professional  norms to such an ex-
tent that Charles Evens Hughes called Pollock a self-inflicted wound on
a  par with  Dred Scott.272  This  comparison  is  instructive,  because  in
both instances  the Court was  driven by the pressure of resistance  to
cast aside precedent and deny its ideological foes a victory.273
As an  initial matter, the  majority's holding that the income tax
law was invalid under the Direct Tax Clauses was  ultra vires because
the courts had no authority to grant the relief sought.  Petitioner was
asking that the income tax be enjoined.274  The problem with this re-
quest, as the dissenters loudly pointed out, was that a federal statute
barred  courts from  enjoining  the collection  of federal  taxes.275  In-
deed, the law was clear that the only route for an aggrieved taxpayer
was to pay the disputed tax and sue for damages. 276  Accordingly, the
proper disposition  of the case was a  dismissal without reaching  the

sis added).

276  See id. at 610 (White, J., dissenting)  ("'[T]he general government has wisely

CONSTITUTIONAL  FALSE  POSITIVES
merits,  as  the Court did not have  the power to grant the requested
relief. In essence,  the Pollock litigation was brought in the wrong way.
To this objection,  the Court responded that "the question of ju-
risdiction, for the purposes  of the case,  was explicitly waived on the
argument."277  Even  assuming that a subject-matter jurisdictional  de-
fect  could  be  waived,  which  was  highly  dubious  given  the  limited
scope of Article III courts, judges normally do not rule on major legal
issues unless they are clearly presented.  Yet there was an odd symme-
try at work here.  Debs said that courts had the equitable power to bar
strikes without statutory authorization,  while  Pollock held that an  ex-
press  statutory  denial  did  not bar equitable  relief against  taxation.
Once  again, the link tying these holdings together was an animus to-
wards the Populists.  If the Court dismissed  Pollock without reaching
the merits like it should have,  then  there would have been no occa-
sion for a broad ruling denouncing the insurgents'  constitutional vi-
sion before the crucial 1896 election.278
The  Court  began  its  substantive  analysis  in  Pollock by  quoting
Marbury v.  Madison for the  proposition  that constitutional  review  is
"'the very essence of judicial duty."' 279  To a modern ear, this sounds
like boilerplate.  In fact, this was another revolutionary step-like the
embrace  of the  Commerce  Clause-that  is  obscured  by the  lack of
recognition  given  to the Populist false positive.  Davison M. Douglas
points out that Marbuiy was never cited by the Justices in support of
judicial review prior to 1887, and most legal commentators referred to
277  Id. at 554 (majority opinion).  The majority also suggested that this was a suit
to prevent the misappropriation of corporate funds rather than a claim to restrain tax
collection.  See id.  That argument is unpersuasive.  Since the point of limiting the
judiciary's  equitable  power was  to prevent tax collection  from being hindered,  al-
lowing an exception for corporate shareholders would seriously disrupt the federal
scheme.
278  More evidence that the majority was chomping at the bit to engage in an act of
heroic resistance was supplied by their decision to hear Pollock twice.  During the first
argument, one Justice was ill and the Court reached a decision on only whether taxes
on income from real estate and municipal bonds were direct.  See Pollock II, 158 U.S.
601,  618  (1895)  ("Our previous decision was confined  to the consideration  of the
validity of the tax on the income from real estate, and on the income from municipal
bonds.");  Fiss,  supra note 19,  at 76 (noting Justice Jackson's illness).  When the ill
Justice returned, the Court granted a rehearing and ruled that all income taxes were
direct.  See Pollock II, 158 U.S. at 618 ("We  are now permitted to broaden the field of
inquiry . . . [to]  a tax upon a person's entire income  . . . .").  The Court was not
required to hear the broader argument again.  But instead of confining itself to a
narrow holding, the Court asserted that its prior conclusions "must be enlarged by the
acceptance of their logical conclusions."  Id. at 617.

the case as an authority only for original jurisdiction, writs of manda-
mus, or other technical  matters.280  In the  1890s the  case enjoyed a
revival, which Douglas attributes  to the controversy  surrounding Pol-
lock and  the  need  to  defend  that opinion from  Populist attacks.281
Choate's oral argument was a prime example of that change in allud-
ing to Marbury as a way of reminding the Justices of their duty to act
even in the face of popular resistance.282  That reference had an im-
pact, as Pollock marked the first time that the Court used Marbury as a
justification for voiding a statute.283  This illustrates the creative power
of mutual transformation  better than  any example  discussed  so far.
The Court's hunt for new authorities to fight a growing popular move-
ment led to the canonization  of what is now the most famous case in
American law.284
This novelty was followed by an even greater one, as the Justices
set aside longstanding  doctrine and invalidated  a federal  tax for the
first time.  Mustering a set of rather unimpressive  quotes from some
Framers,  some  eighteenth-century  economists,  and  some  English
cases on direct taxes, the Court held that the Direct Tax Clauses were
designed  "to prevent an attack upon accumulated  property by mere
force  of numbers."285  Indeed,  these  provisions  were  "one  of the
bulkwarks of private rights and private property."286  I use "unimpres-
sive"  to describe this claim because the majority ignored the purpose
of these clauses  (i.e., to block a slave  tax) while conceding that there
was no clear evidence to support the argument that income taxes were
direct.2 7  Besides, Justice Harlan's dissent observed that these materi-

als "have been  several  times directly brought to the attention of this
court" and were  rejected every time.288
The majority's behavior  only got worse when it tried to run the
gauntlet established  by the precedents  declaring that only head and
land taxes were direct for constitutional purposes.289  In fact, the chal-
lenge for lawyers seeking to void the income tax was even more formi-
dable because  the  Court had often said  that income  taxes were  not
direct.290  Pollock distinguished  these  cases by calling their direct tax
statements dicta.291  The Court had a tougher time dealing with  Hyl-
ton v. United States292-the  first case construing the Direct Tax Clauses
as  applying  to  only land  and people-and  resorted  to  the  strange
claim that "[t] he case [was]  badly reported" and should not be read as
authority  against extending those  provisions  to income  taxes.293  As
for the Springer v. United States294 case that upheld an income tax, the
Court said this "grew out of the war of the rebellion  . . . and aban-
word 'direct' in the Constitution by resorting to the theoretical opinions on taxation
found in the writings of some economists ..  "); supra notes 263-65 and accompany-
ing text.
288  See Pollock II, 158 U.S. at 641  (Harlan, J., dissenting).
289  The view  that land taxes were  direct was well established as far back as the
Court's first interpretation of the Direct Tax Clauses.  See Hylton v. United States, 3
U.S.  (3 Dall.)  171,  174 (1796)  (opinion of Chase, J.)  ("[T]he direct taxes  contem-
plated by the Constitution, are only two, to wit, a capitation ...  and a tax on land.");
Fiss, supra note 19, at 87.  The rationale for calling land taxes direct was similar to the
one for slaves-it alleviated sectional strife by barring small states from abusing their
power in the Senate to tax large states.
290  See, e.g.,  Springer v. United  States, 102 U.S.  586, 602  (1881)  (upholding an
income tax and stating "that direct taxes, within the meaning of the Constitution, are
only capitation  taxes, as expressed  in  that instrument, and taxes  on real estate");
Scholey v. Rew, 90 U.S. (23 Wall.) 331, 347-48 (1874)  (stating that a direct tax "does
not include the tax on income").
291  Compare Pollock 1, 157  U.S. at 576-78  (discussing these cases only to dismiss

By contrast, the present tax came "in a time of profound peace" and
this "furnishes an additional  reason for circumspection  and care  in
disposing of the  case."296  Yet nothing  in  Springer indicated  that  it
rested on an emergency rationale, and in any event is hard to see the
relevance of this distinction for the Direct Tax Clauses.297  Given this
performance, it is no wonder that the dissenters accused the Court of
threatening the rule of law.298
Contemporary observers  understood  that the source of Pollock's
unholy trinity of errors-disregarding the Court's equitable limits, dis-
torting the original understanding  of the Direct Tax Clauses, and ig-
noring  layers  of  precedent-was  the  spirit  of  resistance  against
Populism. Justice Field's concurrence was the most explicit about this
motivation, observing  that "[t]he present assault upon capital is  but
the beginning.  It will be but the stepping-stone to others, larger and
more sweeping,  till  our political contests  will  become  a war of the
poor against the rich; a war constantly growing in intensity and bitter-
ness."299  With this statement, Field was acknowledging  that the pro-
cess of escalation was well underway and that he was not going to just
stand by and watch.  Instead,  he called  the income  tax an  "arbitrary
discrimination"  and argued for the legal equivalence  of racial,  relig-
ious, and wealth discrimination.300
While Justice Brown's  dissent denounced  the influence  of "the
spectre  of socialism,"301 the real fireworks came from Justice Harlan.
The most effective way of conveying the impact of Harlan's dissent is

297  In a related case, the Court upheld the use of paper money during the Civil

not with  an  exegesis  of his  text, but with  a sampling  of the critical
commentary.  For instance,  The New  York  Times said  "[1]awyers  who
have  practiced  for  years  before  the  Supreme  Court  say  they  never
before listened to such revolutionary statements from the bench.  The
most rampant Populist could not have...  shown greater contempt for
the  views  of the  majority than Justice  Harlan  did in  [his]  long ha-
rangue."30 2  Likewise,  The Chicago Tribune noted that 'Justice  Harlan
led off with a sensational address which will make him the Presidential
candidate  of the Populist  party next year if he  cares  for the  empty
honor."30 3  Lastly,  The Nation opined that "[t] he heat with which Jus-
tice Harlan expounded the Marx gospel from the bench showed that
the brake [on Populism] was applied none too soon.  The Judge's ob-
servations on the need of the tax to keep the rich in their places was as
odd as anything that has fallen from a court."304  At this point, there
was no denying that the Court was now engaged in the broader consti-
tutional dialogue, with the majority of its members firmly in the con-
servative camp.
There was also no denying the fact, however,  that mutual trans-
formation was working against the Populists.  In  1893, there were no
legal impediments to strikes and clear precedent supporting the valid-
ity  of the  income  tax.  Now both  acts  were  under  a  constitutional
shadow created by a resistance more interested in victory than in fidel-
ity.305  On  the other hand, the  controversy surrounding Pollock gave
the Populists new momentum as they approached the 1896 presiden-
tial election.306  Only the voters could settle this dispute, as one Popu-
list pamphleteer  argued  that "it is  not  only just but expedient  that
incomes be  taxed.  I am aware  that the people have heard from the
Supreme  Court on this  subject.  The Supreme  Court will  hear from
the people in the near future."30 7

V.  THE 1896  ELECTION AND  THE COURT-PACKING DEBATE
This Part recounts the campaign between Republicans led by Wil-
liam McKinley  and  the  Democrat/Populist  coalition led  by William
Jennings Bryan.  One important facet of that campaign was the public
discussion of transforming the Supreme Court as  the ultimate consti-
tutional  remedy.  Andrew Jackson  did pack the  Court  in  1837  and
Franklin D.  Roosevelt famously failed to do so in 1937, but 1896 was
the only time when  the idea was debated  in  a presidential election
season.308  In effect, the parties were calling upon the American peo-
ple to render a final verdict on the great issue of the day: should the
Populist vision of egalitarian reform go forward or not?
A.  The Fusion of Reform Forces
As Republicans  were united behind a conservative  platform, the
political intrigue in  1896 centered  on whether the Democrats or the
Populists would be the main opposition party.  Within Populist ranks,
there  was a division  between  "fusionists" like James B. Weaver, who
thought the lesson of 1894 was that they could not win withoutjoining
forces with reform Democrats, and "middle of the roaders" like Tom
Watson,  who wanted  to  stay independent  and  avoid a world where
"'we playJonah while they play whale."'309  In the midst of this debate,
the party leadership  made a crucial  decision  to hold its nominating
convention  after the Democratic Convention.310  This left the initia-
tive with the Democrats, for if they adopted a pro-reform stance the
momentum for fusion would be tough to stop.  And when the Demo-
crats met in Chicago-the center of the Pullman Strike-a combina-
tion of shrewd management and fiery oratory convinced the delegates
to nominate William Jennings Bryan on a platform that endorsed the
308  For more on Jackson's Court-packing scheme, see Magliocca, supra note 34, at
554-57  (summarizing the debate).  See also Act of Mar. 3, 1837, ch. 34,  5 Stat. 176
(outliningJackson's court-packing plan).  Franklin D. Roosevelt's Court-packing plan
was not discussed during the 1936 campaign.
309  See BRANDS,  supra note  10, at 270  (quoting Tom Watson);  SUNDQUIST,  supra
note 63, at 152-53.  Another factor was that the Party was divided between its western
wing, which cooperated with Democrats, and its southern wing, which had to cooper-
ate with Republicans against traditional southern Democrats.  Consequently, a choice
for fusion was  damaging for Populists in the South  (and explains why people like
Watson were opposed).  See ARNETT,  supra note 186, at 190 (quoting Watson's edito-
rial against fusion).
310  Marion  Butler was  apparently behind  this decision, and it was  based on an
assumption that the Democrats  would not choose a  reform  candidate.  See HUNT,
supra note 62, at 95. If this premise had borne out, then the Populists, not the Demo-
crats, would have united reformers under their banner.2oo6]
CONSTITUTIONAL  FALSE  POSITIVES
goals of the agrarian movement.311  Most Populists accepted the logic
of fusion and endorsed Bryan's candidacy  a few weeks later.312
Conservatives were stunned by this latest escalation of the crisis,
as their resistance had unified  reformers rather than burying them.
The New York  Times ran headlines such as "Bryan the Demagogue" and
"Logical Candidate of the Party of Fantastic Ideas," and in an editorial
said he "must at any cost and by whatever means are most effective be
beaten."313  The PhiladelphiaP ress argued  that "lIt] his riotous platform
is the concrete creed of the mob.  It is rank Populism intensified and
edged with hate and venom.  It rests upon the four corner stones of
organized  Repudiation,  deliberate  Confiscation,  chartered  Commu-
nism, and enthroned Anarchy."314  Mark Hanna, who was McKinley's
campaign  guru,  said  "(tihe Chicago  convention  from  beginning  to
end was in the hands of a clique  of radicals and revolutionists  ....
Altgeld [ ] and Bryan will never be allowed to wreck a nation they are
seeking to ruin."315  Even Theodore Roosevelt, who is now regarded as
a progressive,  was  aghast at Bryan's  nomination and warned against
"'a red government  of lawlessness  and dishonesty  as  phantastic  [sic]
and vicious as  the Paris Commune itself.' "316

ocratic and Populist platforms).  Governor Altgeld probably would have been nomi-

The  nomination  of  Bryan  shattered  the  party  that  President
Cleveland represented,  and  many Democrats walked out of the Chi-
cago  Convention  and formed  a "Gold  Democrat" ticket.  Cleveland
himself opposed the takeover by the Populists and told his supporters
that "[a]  cause worth fighting for is worth fighting for to the end."317
At their convention, the Gold Democrats said "all good citizens of the
republic are bound to repudiate  [Bryan's principles]  and exert every
lawful  means  to  insure  the  defeat of the candidates  that represent
these false doctrines. '318  Moreover, their platform said "[t]he Demo-
cratic party has survived many defeats, but could not survive  a victory
won in behalf of the doctrine and the policy proclaimed in its name at
Chicago."319  The climax of the constitutional struggle was at hand, as
the power  of mutual transformation  was  shearing away old  loyalties
and reorienting  the parties along the ideological fault line drawn by
the Populists.320  As  The Nation said, "[p]robably no man in civil life

B.  Transforming the Supreme Court-The FinalF  lanking Maneuver
One  portion  of the  Democratic  platform  that  became  a  flash
point in  the campaign  concerned  its response  to  Pollock, which  was
widely interpreted  as  a promise  to  pack the Court with Populist Jus-

322  This does not mean that the Court was the central issue of the campaign,  Re-
formers  put their focus  on  the unlimited coinage  of silver.  Indeed, the point of
Bryan's "Cross of Gold" speech at the Democratic Convention was to make that ques-
tion the centerpiece  of the election, and this had such a powerful impact that free
silver is now the chief thing the Populists are remembered for.  See Bryan, supra note
66, at 772 ("You shall not press down upon the brow of labor this crown of thorns; you
shall not crucify mankind upon a cross of gold.").  Though agrarian leaders saw this as
a winning issue, other activists worried  that this was a flawed strategy because higher
prices held no appeal for urban voters.  See BRANDS, supra note 10, at 282-83  ("[I]t
was hard for city-dwelling factory workers to get excited .... Higher prices for wheat
and cotton meant little to them except higher prices for bread and clothes.").  Rich-
ard Hofstadter once said that this sort of poor choice was typical for Populists who2006] CONSTITUTIONAL  FALSE  POSITIVES
mains after the decision, or which may come from its reversal by the
court as  it may  hereafter be  constituted."323  Conservatives  leapt on
this as the "smoking gun" indicating that the Populists were bent on
destroying  the Constitution through revolutionary  means.324
In the view of many observers, this plank in the Democratic plat-
form meant nothing less than an end to judicial independence.  The
Gold  Democrats  were  especially  concerned,  contending  that Bryan
"assails  the  independence  of the judiciary by a covert threat to reor-
ganize  the courts whenever  their decisions  contravene  the decree  of
the  party caucus."325  Indeed,  the  Gold  Democrat  vice  presidential
candidate said that "the Chicago  convention would wipe virtually out
of existence that Supreme Court which interprets the law, forgetting
that our ancestors in England fought for hundreds of years to obtain a
tribunal ofjustice which was free from executive control."3 26  Republi-
cans  were  also  critical,  and  their  campaign  manual  explained  that
"[f]rom  the days of Marbury v.  Madison  to those  of the income-tax
cases, there have been many criticisms of the opinions of the Supreme
Court, but the platform at Chicago is the first party assault upon the
constitutional  tenure of the Justices."327  With this statement, we can
see that the rediscovery of Marbuiy now extended beyond the Court to
the electorate at large as conservatives asserted their alternative to the
Populist vision .328
The view that Bryan was planning to pack the Court was echoed
in the press, as exemplified by this cartoon that appeared on the cover
"had been subsisting for long years upon a monotonous diet of failure."  HOFSTADTER,

crown),  and Jacob  Coxey  (wearing  a helmet for  Coxey's Army).330
The message was clear: Bryan's plans for the Court were part of a scary
agenda  that should be rejected at the polls.331
Bryan denied that he was attacking judicial review, but he did not
hide  the fact  that he wanted  changes  in the  Court.  In  a speech  at
Madison  Square Garden,  the candidate explained  that "[o]ur oppo-
nents endeavored to make it appear that the income tax plank of our
platform assailed the Supreme Court. This criticism was entirely with-
out foundation.  The platform commended  the income tax, and sug-
gested  the  possibility  that  the  court  might  hereafter  reverse  its
decision and return to the earlier precedents."332  After all, "[a]  future
court has a right  to declare  a similar income  tax law constitutional.
Even the present members of the court have a right to change  their
opinions on this subject asjudges have in the past changed their opin-
ions."333  During another speech, Bryan made a classic legal realist ar-
gument, stating that "[t] he Supreme court changes from time to time.
Judges die or resign, and new judges take their places.  Is it not possi-
ble, my friends, that future judges may adhere to the precedents of a
hundred years, instead of adhering to a decision rendered by a major-
ity of one?"334  This defense was a fascinating blend of law and politics.
In one sense, Bryan was saying that once the pressure of mutual trans-
formation was removed the Court might return to its senses and to its
precedents.  At the same time, his comments left open the possibility
of making this change  happen  by appointing rabid Populists  to the
bench as per the  Harper's cartoon.335

What stands out about this debate is the willingness of both sides
to engage the voters on this central question.  The cycle of escalation
begun  by President Cleveland's  decision  to oppose  the Populists  in
1893 had culminated just three years later in a sharp ideological polar-
ization that forced the people to consider first principles anew, up to
and  including  the role  of the  Supreme  Court in  the  constitutional
system.  The time for political  tactics was over;  the voters were about
to return a decision.
C.  The Outcome
With voter turnout reaching an astounding  eighty percent, Mc-
Kinley carried the country and in the process realigned the electorate
in  a conservative  direction.336  The  Republican  margin was  600,000
votes out of 13.9 million cast, and Bryan lost in the Electoral College
by 271  to 176.337  Reformers failed because their rural orientation did
not  connect  with  urban  citizens,  as  the  Democrat/Populist  ticket
failed  to win  any major  city other  than  New  Orleans.338  Naturally,
conservatives  breathed  a sigh of relief, with  The Nation opining that
" [w] e have escaped from ...  an immense danger, the danger of hav-
ing our currency adulterated  and our form of government changed,
and  a band of ignoramuses and Anarchists  put at the head  of what
remained  of the  great American  republic."339  Principled resistance
had succeeded  in turning back the agrarian charge.
Not only was this defeat decisive, but the  1896 election realigned
partisan  loyalties  and ushered  in  an  era of Republican  dominance.
There was no way to know this at the time, as a single election-like a
single opinion-cannot change the law by itself. When Bryan and Mc-
Kinley squared off again in 1900, however, the Republicans won by an
336  This record participation was the result of unprecedented mobilization efforts.
See CHERNY,  supra note 251,  at 69  (observing that 1896  saw the highest turnout of
eligible voters in any national election).  Prior to 1896, presidential candidates  did
not personally  campaign because  it was considered undignified.  See BRANDS,  supra
note 10, at 279-80.  See generally JEFFREY K. TULls, THE RHETORICAL PRESIDENCY  (1987)
(describing this aspect of presidential campaigning).  Bryan demolished this taboo by
embarking on a whistle-stop  tour that included six hundred speeches, and it is said

even  greater  margin.3'4°  And  over  the  coming years,  the  evidence
would  accumulate  that "the  switching voters  were not coerced  into
voting for McKinley;  they were  converted."'341  The impact of this con-
version on the Populist Party was devastating, as they evaporated as a
force in American politics.  By daring greatly and failing, the Populists
only  solidified  the  grip  of conservatives  on  power.  The  law  pro-
nounced by the High Court would soon reflect the gravitational pull
exerted by this constitutional  false positive.
VI.  THE AGONY OF DEFEAT
This Part summarizes how doctrine was transformed by the Popu-
list failure.  In particular, the text analyzes two opinions issued imme-
diately after the election that redefined the Fourteenth Amendment
in  a  manner consistent  with  the  negative  implication  of Populism.
Then the text gives  an explanation  of how a false positive  approach
offers the best explanation  for these developments.
A.  The Fourteenth Amendment Rebom
The  most important element missing  in  the  story so  far is  the
Fourteenth Amendment.  All of the great decisions issued in 1895 fo-
cused on provisions in the original Constitution (i.e.,  the Commerce
Clause and the Direct Tax Clauses).  The argument  over federalism
after the Pullman Strike,  however, was about the appropriate role of
states  in  regulating  property  rights.  Even  if Populists  were  barred
from  the levers  of national  power and  federal  courts  could  enjoin
strikes supported by local officials, reformers still had plenty of room
to develop their egalitarian economic policies at the state level.  Recall
that in the Granger Cases the Supreme Court held that states were gen-
erally  free-notwithstanding  the  Fourteenth  Amendment-to  exer-
cise their police  power.342
Before  McKinley was even inaugurated,  however, the Justices ab-
ruptly  changed  course and  issued two unanimous  opinions  holding
that the Fourteenth  Amendment imposed substantive  limits on state
regulatory authority.343  These rulings, which came down on the same

leadership of McKinley and Hanna[ ] produced a combination of votes which gave it
the victory in 1896 and which promised Republican ascendancy for many years....").

ing that the Fourteenth Amendment incorporated  the Takings Clause); Allgeyer v.NOTRE  DAME  LAW  REVIEW [VOL.  81:3
day, were  shocking  because  the  Court had repeatedly  rejected  this
construction  of the Amendment in the past.344  For example,  in the
Slaughter-House Cases345  -the  first  ones  construing  the  Fourteenth
Amendment-the Justices held that neither the Privileges or Immuni-
ties Clause nor any other provision barred a state from creating a mo-
nopoly that excluded  citizens  from a  trade.346  A few years  later, in
Davidson v.  New  Orleans,347  the  Court  held  that  the  Fourteenth
Amendment's  Due Process Clause did not bar the states from taking
private  property without just compensation.34  While  Davidson said,
consistent with  past precedent,  that there  might be  a constitutional
problem  in an  extreme  case where a state just confiscated  property
and gave it to someone else, as a practical matter  the Court made  it
clear that the states had wide latitude.349  Indeed, the Court went out
of its way to express its exasperation  with  litigants who claimed  that
the police power was restricted by the Due Process Clause, explaining
that "there exists some strange misconception of the scope of this pro-
vision as found in the fourteenth  amendment."350

the  "liberty of contract").  Both cases were decided on March  1, a few days before
McKinley's inaugural.

(1877)  ("For protection against abuses by legislatures the people must resort to the
polls, not to the courts.").  There was one case before 1897 that voided a state railroad
regulation under a procedural due process theory.  See Chi., Milwaukee & St. Paul Ry.

protection for property rights from state action.  See id. at 96-101  (Field, J., dissent-
ing).  Those contrary views, though, did not garner a majority until after the Populist
false positive.

land, which is now in A., shall be and is hereby vested in B., would, if effectual, de-

1.  The Takings  Clause Expands
Yet in its first blockbuster prior to McKinley's inaugural, the Jus-
tices overruled  Davidson and  held  that the Fourteenth  Amendment
extended the Takings Clause to the states.  Asserting that "protection
of the rights of property has been regarded  as a vital principle of re-
publican institutions," the Court in  Chicago, Burlington &  Quincy Rail-
road Co. v. Chicago351 explained that "a judgment of a state court...
whereby private property is taken for the state or under its direction
for public use, without compensation  made or secured to the owner
is  . . . wanting in the due process of law required  by the fourteenth
amendment."3 52  The  Court  reasoned  that if the  pure  confiscation
and transfer  of property was suspect, as the  earlier cases  said, then
surely due process must be "applicable to the direct appropriation by
the State to public use and without compensation of the private prop-
erty of the citizen."353  Of course, this is exactly the chain of logic that
Davidson had rejected twenty years earlier.
One  potential  explanation  for this  turnabout is  that the  Court
was  finally  implementing  the  will  of the  Fourteenth  Amendment's
framers to incorporate the Bill of Rights.  Assuming arguendo that this
represents  the correct reading  of the constitutional  text, one would
then expect that  Chicago would be followed by other cases  extending
that principle to the other provisions of the Bill of Rights.  But this did
not happen.  Instead, three years later the Court held in  Maxwell v.
Dow354  that the  grand  and petit jury requirements of the Fifth  and
Sixth  Amendments  were  not  extended  to  the  states  by  the  Four-
teenth.3 55  Furthermore, the Court rejected any evidence  that the Re-
construction  Framers  wanted  to  incorporate  the  Bill  of Rights,  as
"[w] hat individual Senators or Representatives may have urged in de-
bate  . . . does  not  furnish  a  firm  ground  for  its  proper  construc-
tion."356 Justice Harlan, the lone dissenter in Maxwell, argued that the
majority's  view  was  inconsistent  with  Chicago and  observed  that  "it

352  Id.  at 235-36, 241; see also Adamson  v. California, 332 U.S. 46, 79-80  (1947)
(Black, J., dissenting)  (stating that Chicago "in effect, overruled" Davidson).
353  166 U.S. at 236.  Thus, the Court did not say that it was overruling Davidson. In
fact, Justice Harlan implausibly cited Davidson as support for his conclusion.  See id. at
235-36.

355  Id.  at 595-96.

would seem that the protection  of private property is of more conse-
quence that the protection  of the life and liberty of the citizen. 357
Since a general pursuit of incorporation cannot explain the ex-
tension  of the Takings  Clause to  the states, the only other plausible
explanation  is that the  Court, as  Harlan  suggested, was  now giving
property  rights  a privileged  status against  state  action.  The  impor-
tance of Chicago should not be exaggerated, as the Takings Clause was
rarely invoked afterwards.358  There was no doubt, though, that some-
thing significant had changed  in the wake of Bryan's defeat.
2.  The "Liberty of Contract"
The companion  case  to Chicago was more consequential,  as the
Court struck down a state regulatory statute with a novel theory that
the Fourteenth Amendment guaranteed a "liberty of contract."  In All-
geyer v.  Louisiana3,59 Justice  Peckham  laid  the  groundwork  for  his
opinion in Lochner v. New York360 with words quoted at length in the
beginning of this Article:  "The liberty mentioned in that amendment
means .. .[the right]  to pursue any livelihood or avocation, and for
that purpose  to enter into all contracts which may be proper, neces-
sary and  essential  . Just as  Chicago overturned  Davidson, so
"..."361 
Allgeyer overturned  Slaughter-House and its proposition  that the Four-
teenth Amendment  did  not protect a  right  to  pursue  the  butcher
trade or any other avocation.362  The Court also made it clear that this
357  Id. at 614 (Harlan, J., dissenting).  Harlan joined Chicago because he believed
that every part of the Bill of Rights applied to the states, not just the ones that protect
property.  See id.
358  Indeed,  Chicago itself held that the state action at issue was not a taking.  166
U.S. at 241-58; see also id. at 259  (Brewer, J., concurring in part and dissenting in
part) (rejecting the Court's analysis on the merits).

360  198 U.S. 45 (1905).
361  Allgeyer, 165 U.S. at 589; see also id. at 591 (describing the "liberty to contract").
This case involved a state law regulating marine insurance contracts with out-of-state
firms. For more on Allgeyer and Justice Peckham, see ROBERT H. BORK,T HE TEMPTING
OF AMERICA:  THE POLITICAL SEDUCTION OF THE LAW 43-46 (1990).
362  See Adamson v. California, 332 U.S. 46, 80 (1947)  (Black, J., dissenting)  (ex-
plaining that Allgeyer "substantially adopted the rejected argument of counsel in the
Slaughter-House cases, that the Fourteenth  Amendment guarantees  the liberty of all
persons under 'natural  law'  to engage  in their chosen  business or vocation").  This
sub silentio reversal of Slaughter-House is also relevant for the debate on incorporation.
Some scholars argue that Slaughter-House is consistent with a pro-incorporation view.
See Newsom,  supra note 9, at 675-83;  see also id. at 710-11  (explaining that counsel
raising incorporation claims relied on Slaughter-Housef or support).  Newsom's claim is
that the standard reading of Slaughter-House as an anti-incorporation opinion actually
flows from Maxwell's misreading of the case.  See id. at 742-44.  Rather than arguing2oo6]

new restriction  on state  authority over  property rights  was  open-en-
ded,  for while  states had a police  power "[w] hen and  how far such
power may be legitimately exercised with regard to these subjects must
be left for determination  to each  case as it  arises. '363  The fears  of
James B. Weaver and his Populist allies were realized, as a laissez-faire
philosophy was now firmly entrenched in the Constitution.364
B.  A  Summary of the New Fourteenth Amendment
Upon reviewing  the circumstances  surrounding  Chicago and All-
geyer, it is hard not to conclude that the Populist false positive was the
cause of the Court's final escalation in the constitutional process.  To-
gether  these  decisions  imposed  robust limits  on the  regulation  of
property in the public interest and struck at the heart of the Populist
ideology.  The timing of these rulings, coming on the heels of Bryan's
defeat, suggests a causal relationship.  And there are parallels between
the trio of great cases in 1895, which were about fighting Populism,
and the pair of remarkable cases in 1897, particularly in their cavalier
treatment of precedent.  On the other hand, the need to resist Popu-
lism was greater in 1895 because the outcome of the presidential elec-
tion was still in doubt.
One explanation  for the Justices'  behavior  is that they read  the
election results as a vindication of conservative resistance and a signal
that voters  wanted to  move  away from  the rejected  ideals of Popu-
lism.365  Chicago and  Allgeyer can be viewed  as  building blocks for a
new legal  regime  defined  by the negative  implication  of Populism,
that the Court misconstrued  Slaughter-House for some inexplicable reason, a better
explanation  may be that Maxwell accurately reflected  the fact that Slaughter-House's
interpretation  of Reconstruction  on all counts  (race,  incorporation,  and  property
rights) was repudiated by the Populist false positive.  The text explains that this was
certainly true with respect to state property regulation, and the future articles in this
project will make  the same point for incorporation and race.  See supra note 9.
363  Allgeyer, 165 U.S. at 590.  It is not easy to reconcile Justice Harlan's views with
his decision to join Allgeyer. At best, one could say that Harlan construed the liberty of
contract narrowly, as demonstrated by his dissent in Lochner. See Lochner, 198 U.S. at
65-74 (Harlan, J., dissenting).
364  See supra note 102 and accompanying  text.
365  In fact, this was the era in which Finley Peter Dunne uttered his famous quip,
through  the fictitious Mr. Dooley, that the Supreme Court "follows th' iliction  [sic]
returns." FINLEY PETER DUNNE,  MR. DOOLEY'S OPINIONS  26 (1902).  Dunne was com-
menting on the Court's decision in the Insular Cases, in which the Justices held that
the recent conquests from the Spanish-American War were not subject to a variety of
constitutional provisions.  See Downes v. Bidwell, 182 U.S. 244 (1901).  That case came
on the heels of Bryan's defeat in 1900, where he made anti-imperialism the theme of
his campaign against McKinley.886  NOTRE  DAME  LAW  REVIEW  [VOL.  81:3
which added to the Court's tentative steps in that direction in  1895.
This point comes into focus when  1897 is  compared  to the  famous
"switch-in-time"  of 1937.  In  each case,  the Court overturned  prece-
dent regarding the power of government to regulate property rights,
even  though no constitutional  amendment was enacted.  To the ex-
tent that the shift  during  the  New Deal  was  a product  of external
forces, the explanation is that the Court was responding to a powerful
desire expressed by the electorate for a new governing framework.366
The Populist false positive  did the same thing but in the opposite di-
rection.  That process is harder to see because it was more attenuated
than the New Deal revolution.  Ascertaining the meaning of the nega-
tive  implication of Populism is a step removed from interpreting an
affirmative call for change.
The advantage of reading the Court's actions as an interpretation
of the Populist false positive is that it provides a more elegant explana-
tion than the competing alternatives.  Indeed, the lack of attention in
constitutional theory to false positives leads scholars reviewing this pe-
riod  into two  false  choices.  The first is  that the  Court made  gross
errors ofjudgment in cases such as Pollock and Allgeyer, which is exem-
plified  by the  criticism  of the liberty of contract  cases.367  There  is
some truth in this observation,  as was shown in the earlier discussion
of Pollock's flaws.368  But it is  hard to  sustain the argument  that this
Court was, for some reason, far more willing to impose its value judg-
ments and distort the  law than  courts of other eras.  The second  is
that  the  Fourteenth  Amendment  really  did  embody  a  laissez-faire
principle, and hence decisions such as  Allgeyer and Lochner were cor-
rect.369  There is also some truth to this observation, since a text that
facilitated the shift from slave  to free labor cannot be read as being
wholly indifferent to the issue of economic regulation.  Unfortunately
366  In both the New Deal and Populist examples, the claim can be made that the
Court's actions were entirely driven by internal dynamics.  Put another way, one can-
not dismiss the argument that Chicago and Allgeyer would have occurred even if the
Populists had not appeared. All one can do is evaluate the available evidence and ask
whether that explanation is persuasive given the magnitude  of the change and the
circumstantial links between the  Supreme Court's results and developments  in the
political world.  My view, after considerable  reflection, is that, at least in the Populist
case, a purely doctrinal answer is not compelling.
367  See, e.g., Richard A. Primus, Canon, Anti-Canon, andJ udicialD issent, 48 DuKE L.J.
243, 244-45 (1998)  (describing Lochner as a "paradigmatic example[ ] of what is not
the law").
368  See supra notes 272-300 and accompanying text.
369  See Bruce Ackerman,  Liberating Abstraction, 59  U.  CHI.  L.  REV.  317,  340-41
(1992).  See generally William E. Forbath, The Ambiguities of Free Labor: Labor and the Law
in the Gilded Age,  1985 Wis. L. REv. 767 (offering a defense of this position).2oo6]  CONSTITUTIONAL  FALSE  POSITIVES  887
for this position,  there is no credible  indication  that the framers  of
that Amendment  wanted  courts  to  exercise  supervisory  power  over
state property regulation.  Furthermore, this analysis provides no an-
swer for why the Supreme Court refused to construe the Amendment
as restrictive  of the states'  substantive police power until 1897.
Neither of these conventional  explanations works  because  each
misses the big picture; it was the failure of Populism and the resulting
displacement  of the law  that accounts  for the  revision  of the  Four-
teenth  Amendment.  The evidence  for this hypothesis  is  even more
powerful when one reflects on the other major developments at this
time.370  For instance,  the  transformation  of the  Commerce  Clause
from  a backwater  into  the  main  provision for assertions  of federal
power was not the product of a renegade Court or a rediscovery of the
original intent of that provision.  The unprecedented authorization of
strike  injunctions  cannot  be  attributed  to  the  idiosyncratic  prefer-
ences of the Court given Grover Cleveland's role in opposing the Pull-
man Strike.  Even the invalidation of the federal income tax, which is
the most suspect action  in this era,  is more  consistent with  systemic
opposition to Populism than with a willful act by some judges.  In all
of these  areas, the false positive  of the 1890s set the standard for the
next forty years.  The cord linking them together was the negative im-
plication of Populism.
CONCLUSION
The constitutional equivalent of the Punktation  of Olmutz is the
defeat of the Populist Party.  Proving that every action provokes a reac-
tion, the powerful reform initiative from the heartland sparked an es-
calating campaign of resistance  through the Pullman Strike, the great
cases of 1895, and the debate over Court-packing.  While the rewards
of leading a successful political movement are great, the risks associ-
ated  with  the  failure  of that effort  are just as  great.  Ralph Waldo
Emerson's adage that "[w] hen you strike at a king, you must kill him"
was never more apt than in the 1890s, as the inability of the Populists
to overcome conservative resistance led to a dramatic shift away from
the goals  of reformers.371
The  recognition  that false  positives  have  a  profound  effect  on
doctrine not only clears away the fog that obscures our constitutional
history, but makes an important point that is  lost in the modem  dis-
370  Of course, the evidence considered  here deals only with  economic matters.
The hypothesis asserted in the text is even more convincing when the issues of race
and incorporation  are added to the mix.  See supra note 9.

cussion of judicial review.  At most of the key turning points in  the
path of the law, the Supreme Court resists the popular will at its peril.
In 1896, the American people held in their hands the power to assert
a contrary constitutional vision and made it stick.  Accordingly, voters
hold  the  power  to  withdraw  their  mandate  from  decisions  of the
Court that they disagree with.  The Populist failure dramatizes the pit-
falls  of challenging judicial  supremacy, but that rugged  path  is still
open for every generation of reformers.
