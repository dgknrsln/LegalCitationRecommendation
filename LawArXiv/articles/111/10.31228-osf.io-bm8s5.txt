ABSTRACT 
This Article provides empirical data on the effectiveness of distance 
education in law schools following the American Bar Association’s deci-
sion to increase the number of permitted online course credits from fifteen 
to thirty. Our data, composed of law student surveys and focus groups, 
reveals not only the success of distance education in legal education, but 
also the online teaching methods that are most effective for students.

INTRODUCTION 
Law schools in the United States are increasingly embracing the ben-
efits of new technology and meeting student demand for increased flexi-
bility by investing in online education.1 As of July 2018, a review of law 
school websites reveals that at least thirty of the top one hundred schools 
offer online courses as part of their law school curriculum.2 Furthermore, 
law schools have adopted varying approaches to the incorporation of 
online learning, offering everything from a fully online law degree3 to a 
handful of online courses. Some schools have created hybrid programs in 
which coursework is completed online as well as in the classroom.4 Sev-
eral of these hybrid programs have even replaced existing evening juris 
doctor programs (J.D.).5 The Authors’ law school, Indiana University 
   
  1.  Flexibility is only one of the benefits to online learning that we discuss below. Flexibility 
is an important benefit, especially as it can help attract and retain nontraditional students who have 
family and work demands on their time that might otherwise preclude them from attaining a law de-
gree. See, e.g., Steven C. Bennett, Distance Learning in Law, 38 SETON HALL LEGIS. J. 1, 6–7 (2013) 
(explaining that distance learning can provide flexibility to students who are pursuing a second career 
and, therefore, have family and work obligations that make a typical legal degree education difficult 
to pursue). 
  2.  In July 2018, a research assistant searched and examined the website of each of the top 100 
law schools ranked by U.S. News and World Report. This covered ranks 1 to 99, including ties. The 
assistant looked for information on online or hybrid offerings in course listings and program descrip-
tions. A limitation of this approach is that not all law schools may mention their online offerings on 
their websites, and newly approved or planned online courses may not yet have been added to the 
websites.

1999. See Online Juris Doctor Program, CONCORD L. SCH., https://www.concordlawschool.edu/aca-

 2019]  ASSESSING ONLINE LEARNING IN LAW SCHOOLS  495 
Robert H. McKinney School of Law (IU McKinney), is among those em-
bracing online teaching and learning.6 As of 2019, IU McKinney offers 
approximately two-dozen online courses, most created and run by its ten-
ured faculty.7  
The American Bar Association (ABA) has slowly and steadily shown 
support for the online movement, proposing in early 2018 to expand the 
amount of online instruction permitted in law school J.D. programs.8 Spe-
cifically, based on its “belief that legal education instruction can be deliv-
ered as effectively by distance education as by instruction in the traditional 
manner,”9 the ABA proposed: (1) increasing the total number of credits 
that law students could earn through asynchronous online classes from fif-
teen to thirty; and (2) for the first time ever, permitting students to take ten 
of those credits during their first year of law school.10 The ABA adopted 
this proposal in August 2018,11 thus allowing law schools to offer their 
students the option of taking more online classes in satisfaction of their 
law degrees.12 
Despite this trend toward increasing online offerings for law students, 
few articles assess the effectiveness of teaching and learning in asynchro-
nous courses in the law school environment.13 Furthermore, these articles

  13.  “Asynchronous” course offerings are distinguished from those that are offered “synchro-

dent need not interact online at the same time. In synchronous courses, the professor and student will

tend to be “case studies” in which the authors describe their online courses 
and then make observations and conclusions about the efficacy of online 
teaching in the law school environment.14 These articles generally con-
clude that online courses have a place in the law school curriculum be-
cause they can offer a quality learning experience.15 
The current literature is only starting to address how students feel 
about asynchronous online courses.16 Do they believe such courses pro-
vide a quality learning experience—one that is comparable to quality live 
classroom learning experiences? What do students conclude constitutes a 
quality online learning environment where they can master course material 
as well as the practice skills they will need when they become lawyers? In 
light of the ABA’s new standards regarding online learning, law schools 
may begin allocating more resources to increase their online offerings, in-
creasing the importance of examining the student experience in these pro-
grams.17  
We do not mean to suggest that law schools should only consider 
students’ opinions when deciding whether to offer online courses or how 
to design those courses. However, law schools seek student input on other 
important aspects of the curriculum, including through course evalua-
tions.18 Furthermore, especially in the online setting, student preferences 
should contribute to course design because students are responsible for

their own learning in an autonomous setting such as an online classroom.19 
Yet, there is a paucity of literature comprehensively assessing students’ 
perceptions of online learning in the law school context.  
At this important juncture, where the trend is toward increasing 
online offerings in law schools, this Article fills an important void—shar-
ing the results of a study that assesses the quality of asynchronous online 
teaching and learning in the law school context using student perceptions. 
Our data, gathered from students who have taken online courses at IU 
McKinney, supports the conclusion that students not only want more 
online offerings, but also that online classes can deliver the same quality 
learning experience as live classes. Specifically, the data reveals several 
key conclusions. First, students appreciate an online course that is orga-
nized in the way it presents material and assignments. Second, students 
equate a quality course with one that engages students with course con-
tent—for example, through short, focused, and interesting lectures, or 
through YouTube videos and other media that relate to course content. 
Third, students associate quality courses with those that involve regular 
assessment (especially practice-ready assignments) and professor feed-
back. 
We do not mean to suggest that all law students will perceive all 
online courses as comparable to their live courses in delivering a quality 
teaching and learning experience. That conclusion is overly broad. First, 
some students simply may not enjoy learning through an online platform 
or interacting with technology in this setting.20 Second, some online 
courses may not appeal to students who are generally receptive to the 
online learning environment.21 Finally, some self-disciplined students who 
have well-developed time-management skills may self-select into online 
courses, thus increasing the likelihood that feedback regarding online 
courses will be positive.22  
The online teaching and learning environment is a unique one, requir-
ing the professor to capture students’ attention remotely. This fact alone

  22.  Much literature suggests that students with high levels of self-regulation and discipline are 
most likely to succeed in the online environment, where they must self-direct their learning process. 
See Anthony R. Artino Jr. & Jason M. Stephens, Academic Motivation and Self-Regulation: A Com-
parative Analysis of Undergraduate and Graduate Students Learning Online, 12 INTERNET & HIGHER 
EDUC. 146, 149 (2009) (finding that graduate students were less likely to procrastinate in online 
courses, a characteristic of self-regulation); Lucy Barnard et al., Online Self-Regulatory Learning Be-
haviors as a Mediator in the Relationship Between Online Course Perceptions with Achievement, 
INT’L REV. RES. OPEN & DISTANCE LEARNING, June 2008, at 8 (explaining that self-regulation ac-
counts for a “positive relationship between student perceptions of online course communication and 
collaboration with academic achievement”); Richard Lynch & Myron Dembo, The Relationship Be-
tween Self-Regulation and Online Learning in a Blended Learning Context, INT’L REV. RES. OPEN & 
DISTANCE LEARNING, August 2004, at 10–12 (conducting a study that found a positive relationship 
“between self-efficacy and performance in online education”). 
 498  DENVER LAW REVIEW  [Vol. 96:3  
means that professors must use unique teaching tools. The data shows that 
students value an online course that takes this reality into account.23 For 
an online course to succeed in delivering a quality teaching and learning 
experience, the professor must also create an online course that is orga-
nized, engaging, and provides opportunities for students to receive feed-
back on activities that allow them to assess their learning of the material 
and practice real-world skills. 
As we predict that law schools will offer increased opportunities for 
online learning, we anticipate that administrations and faculty will be in-
terested in what students say makes an online legal course beneficial both 
academically and practically. Accordingly, Part I of this Article begins by 
detailing the evolution of online learning in law schools, focusing espe-
cially on the role that the ABA plays in regulating the delivery of online 
course content to law students. Part II continues by explaining the different 
types of online classes and discussing some of the perceived advantages 
or disadvantages of each type in terms of student engagement and learning. 
This Part explains the different types so that readers are able to understand 
the nature of an asynchronous course in the context of the other types of 
online course offerings. From this Part, readers will also be able to com-
pare the advantages and disadvantages of asynchronous courses to the 
other types of online offerings. In Part III, we explain our research design. 
In Part IV, we discuss the results of our study that include data from anon-
ymous student surveys and focus group sessions. As noted above, the find-
ings show that students in our study value online courses, want more of 
them, and point to many features of online courses that make them com-
parable to live classes in terms of delivering a quality learning experi-
ence.24 We conclude by providing observations about our findings and 
suggestions for law school professors and administrators as they consider 
increasing their online academic presence. 
I. THE ABA AND ONLINE LEARNING IN LAW SCHOOLS 
Law schools have been slower than their undergraduate and graduate 
counterparts to incorporate online education into their J.D. academic pro-
grams.25 Two overarching reasons explain this phenomenon. First, law 
schools have operated according to one model for more than a century: the 
face-to-face course where “students prepare for class by reading assigned

  25.  Linda Harasim, Shift Happens: Online Education as a New Paradigm in Learning, 3 
INTERNET & HIGHER EDUC. 41, 43 (2000) (stating that the first online undergraduate courses were 
offered through the program Virtual Classroom in 1984, and the first online graduate courses were 
offered through Nova Southeastern University, Connect-Ed, and the University of Toronto in 1985). 
The first online law school courses were offered in the 1997–1998 school year after the ABA’s Ac-
creditation Committee passed the Temporary Guidelines on Distance Learning, which first allowed 
law schools to offer online courses. See Laura N. Gasaway, Distance Learning Survey, SYLLABUS, 
Summer 1998, at 16, 16.

texts or completing other assignments, then attend class where the teacher 
leads a Socratic dialogue, facilitates a discussion, or presents a lecture.”26 
Like all institutions that have a traditional way of doing things, law schools 
are resistant to change.27 Thus, this adherence to the traditional law school 
curriculum has stymied the incorporation of online learning in law schools. 
Second, accredited law schools must abide by the standards advanced by 
their governing body, the ABA.28 Given that the ABA wants to ensure that 
law schools produce well-trained lawyers, it has necessarily taken a cau-
tious approach toward introducing online teaching and learning into the 
law school curriculum.29 
However, the ABA has started to accept the idea of online course 
offerings. In 1997, the ABA made its first move toward allowing online 
education by approving temporary guidelines that allowed law schools to 
include online courses in their J.D. programs.30 The allowed programming 
was limited and excluded asynchronous course offerings.31 In 1999, com-
mentators at the Distance Education Conference expressed concerns about 
online law school courses, questioning the number of distance courses that 
schools could offer and whether courses should be synchronous or asyn-
chronous.32

 500  DENVER LAW REVIEW  [Vol. 96:3  
By 2002, the ABA proposed permanent regulations regarding online 
education in the form of Standard 306 in the ABA’s Standards for Ap-
proval of Law Schools.33 In issuing Standard 306, the ABA emphasized 
that legal education “can include a healthy dose of distance education at 
schools that are willing to invest the time, talent, and resources to make it 
work well.”34 As originally adopted, the Standard allowed for synchronous 
and asynchronous courses, but limited law students to taking no more than 
four online credits in one term and no more than twelve credits throughout 
their enrollment.35 Furthermore, this Standard only allowed students to 
take distance education courses after they had completed twenty-eight 
credits, which equates to the first year of law school.36 The ABA also made 
clear that not all online course offerings would satisfy Standard 306.37 To 
meet this Standard, both synchronous and asynchronous courses had to 
give students “opportunities to interact with instructors that equal or ex-
ceed the opportunities for such interaction with instructors in a traditional 
classroom setting.”38 The ABA did not define the term “interaction,” but 
did make clear that law schools would have to be rigorous in delivering an 
interactive environment.39 
As technology continued to develop, and as more law professors de-
livered courses via online platforms, legal educators began to accept that 
students could receive quality legal education through distance courses.40 
By 2010, thirty-seven law schools offered synchronous courses, and forty 
law schools offered asynchronous courses.41 In 2014, the ABA updated 
Standard 306 to allow J.D. students to take up to fifteen credit hours of 
online courses during their enrollment,42 but gave no explanation for why 
the ABA thought an increase was necessary or permissible.43 However,

of Changes, in COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW OF THE ABA STANDARDS FOR APPROVAL OF LAW SCHOOL 
 2019]  ASSESSING ONLINE LEARNING IN LAW SCHOOLS  501 
under this new standard, the ABA still prohibited students from taking 
online  courses  until  they  had  completed  at  least  twenty-eight  credit 
hours.44 
Most recently, in October 2017, the ABA announced a proposal to 
expand the amount of online instruction permitted in law schools based on 
its “belief that legal education instruction can be delivered as effectively 
by distance education as by instruction in the traditional manner.”45 It ac-
companied this proposed expansion with a call for a “measured transition” 
that would permit “continued evaluation of the effectiveness of distance 
education in the legal education context and developing confidence in the 
effectiveness of distance education by bar admissions authorities.”46 In 
early 2018, the ABA made its proposed amendment to Standard 306 avail-
able for comment.47  
Under the new standard, students could earn up to one-third of their 
total J.D. credit hours online, and ten of those credits could be earned dur-
ing the first year.48 The ABA defines an online course as “one in which 
students are separated from the faculty member or each other for more 
than one-third of the instruction and the instruction involves the use of 
technology to support regular and substantive interaction among students 
and between the students and the faculty member, either synchronously or 
asynchronously.”49  
The amended Standard 306 would place limits on the amount of 
online credit hours J.D. students could accrue. Furthermore, under the 
amended Standard 306, an online course must be “approved as part of the 
school’s regular curriculum approval process” with “opportunity for reg-
ular and substantive interaction between [the] faculty member and student 
and among students; [and] . . . regular monitoring of student effort by the 
faculty member and opportunity for communication about that effort.”50 
Finally, the course must comply with Standard 306’s learning outcomes 
requirements, which emphasize competency in areas such as knowledge

of the law, legal analysis and reasoning, professional responsibility, and 
other legal skills the law school may find appropriate.51 
The Standard 306 proposal received one comment, from Vermont 
Law School, which supported the increase in permissible online credit 
hours and noted that the increase would “attract more non-traditional stu-
dents who otherwise could not commit to three years of study away from 
family, community, or other professional obligations.”52 On May 11, 
2018, the ABA’s Standards Review Committee gave no further recom-
mendations on the proposals to update Standard 306.53 In August 2018, 
the ABA adopted the proposal to allow law students to take the equivalent 
of a full year of classes online.54 
In sum, over the past twenty years, there has been a significant change 
in the acceptability of online learning in law schools. As of 2018, the ABA 
is much more comfortable with online legal education because of law 
school experimentation with online teaching and learning, which delivered 
positive results. This overall shift, combined with the prospect that even 
more law schools will be offering online courses after the ABA’s passage 
of the 2018 Standard, makes studies like the one presented in this Article 
more relevant than ever. Law schools and law professors need to ensure 
that they are delivering quality online courses that engage students and 
encourage them to master the course content and the skills that they need 
to practice law.55  
II. TYPES OF ONLINE COURSE OFFERINGS 
Universities and law schools have traditionally delivered classes to 
their students through the face-to-face classroom setting.56 Yet, distance 
education has a long history. The University of Chicago first pioneered 
distance education in 1892, almost a century before the Internet became 
publicly available, by mailing course materials to students and employing

traveling lecturers.57 The reasons that motivated the University of Chicago 
to incorporate distance learning into its curriculum, such as a desire to in-
crease access to education, withstood the passage of time and fueled mod-
ern-day distance education.58 Since that time, online courses have devel-
oped in various forms as computer and Internet technology has evolved.59  
As defined by the ABA, online classes are those that are distance60 
for more than one-third of the instruction time.61 Hybrid classes are those 
that are distance for one-third or less of total instruction time.62 Online and 
hybrid classes can further be defined by their method of content delivery, 
such as whether content is provided via asynchronous or synchronous 
means.63  
This Part discusses how each type of nontraditional course is admin-
istered, including the role of the professor and students, the types of as-
sessments administered, and the level of interaction between instructor and 
student. This Part also discusses the benefits and detriments of each form 
of online course—from the perspective of both the student and the profes-
sor. Finally, this Part examines the different methods that online courses 
use to deliver content, either synchronously or asynchronously.

professors who are famous in their fields, which may incorporate still im-
ages, audio recordings, or other videos.”64Any person with an Internet con-
nection can access most MOOCs without cost.65 However, some MOOCs 
do require payment and, in exchange, the participant can receive a certifi-
cate of completion.66 In all MOOCs, enrollment is essentially unlimited.67  
Although the term MOOCs was coined in 2008,68 this course format 
did not gain prominence until 2012, when two Stanford University com-
puter science professors launched the for-profit company Coursera.69 Most 
MOOC offerings were initially limited to the science and technology 
fields;70 however, MOOC courses now offer instruction in additional 
fields, including art, design, food and nutrition, history, law, and philoso-
phy.71 At the end of 2012, there were over two million registrations on 
Coursera, and “[b]y May 2013, Coursera was offering 370 different 
courses, and it had signed partnership agreements with thirty-three univer-
sities, including Princeton, Brown, and Columbia.”72 Coursera now touts 
thirty-three million enrollments, partnerships with over 150 universities, 
over 2,700 courses, and at least 4 degree programs.73 Expanding the mar-
ket,  Massachusetts  Institute  of  Technology  and  Harvard  University 
launched the nonprofit platform edX.74 EdX currently partners with over 
120 institutions75 and offers over 2,100 courses.76  
MOOCs have “a syllabus, and course content typically consists of 
readings, assignments, and lectures, which are often short (6–12 minutes) 
‘microlectures.’”77 Many professors post online the same content that they

are presenting live at their home universities, so their initial burden in cre-
ating a MOOC is relatively small.78 Students then follow the dictates of 
the syllabus, which involves reading class materials, watching lectures, 
“participat[ing] in online discussions and forums, and complet[ing] quiz-
zes and tests on the course material.”79 However, professors in MOOCs 
face a large burden in terms of student interaction and grading.80 It is dif-
ficult for them to provide students with direct feedback given the poten-
tially thousands of students participating in the course.81 Thus, professors 
may opt to have teaching assistants monitor student work and respond to 
student questions on discussion boards.82 If an assignment or exam cannot 
be graded automatically through a computer, the professor may also rely 
on peer grading with several students grading the same assignment.83 
MOOCs are beneficial for students because prerecorded lectures pro-
vide students access to course content anywhere and at anytime.84 Addi-
tionally, because many MOOCs are free or low cost, they attract students 
with a wide array of interests, from “informal learning, competency in a 
particular area . . . , and, in some cases, credit toward a formal degree or 
certification program.”85 Finally, if assignments are computer graded, stu-
dents can get their results and feedback instantaneously.86 For professors, 
MOOCs can be beneficial because they “encourage institutions to seek 
partnerships and collaborations” and have become “a kind of workspace 
or lab for innovation, helping uncover new best practices that can be used 
in other online, blended, or face-to-face settings.”87  
While the low-to-no cost, unlimited-enrollment online model makes 
higher education more accessible to all, it also contributes to the inherent 
disadvantages of MOOCs. As described above, while launching MOOCs 
might be relatively easy for professors, difficulties arise when they must 
interact with, and grade the work of, potentially thousands of enrollees. 
Students may not receive adequate, or any, interaction with the professors. 
Instead, students must seek out peer-to-peer interaction, and might have 
varying degrees of success.88 For example, differences in students’ interest

and motivation determine the value and accuracy of their feedback to 
peers.89  
Further, MOOCs are known for their staggeringly low completion 
rates.90 For example, free MOOCs at edX averaged less than 10% comple-
tion rates in 2016.91 In comparison, edX’s 2016 completion rates were 
much higher for courses requiring a fee.92 This suggests that low comple-
tion rates can be attributed to the lack of financial investment from stu-
dents, which allows them to drop the course without any adverse monetary 
consequences.93 
B. Blended/Hybrid Courses, Including Flipped Classrooms 
Blended, or hybrid, learning combines elements of the traditional 
face-to-face and online classrooms.94 It includes moving some, but not all, 
of the instruction to the online format and supplementing classroom in-
struction with online activities.95  
The blended class structure can take many forms,96 including the 
flipped classroom structure discussed more fully below.97 In some forms, 
the online component is used to replace some traditional face-to-face class 
time,98 while in others, it may not replace much face-to-face class time at 
all.99 For example, a professor could decide to have one-third of the class 
online with the other two-thirds in the classroom, while another could de-
cide to have face-to-face class meetings at the beginning and end of the 
semester with the rest of the class conducted online.100 
Because hybrid courses can take many forms, the roles of the profes-
sor and students vary depending on what the professor decides to place 
online. The professor may only post a lecture online for a student to watch 
before the next face-to-face class session,101 or the professor might require 
students to complete an activity, such as take an online quiz, participate in

a real-time online chat room, post on a discussion board,102 or respond to 
questions about the reading assignment.103 
While some university officials “have reservations about the relative 
quality of online learning,” they are most enthusiastic about blended/hy-
brid courses and “consistently rate the promise of blended . . . courses as 
superior to that of fully online courses.”104 Additionally, they “rate the 
learning outcomes for blended instruction as superior to traditional face-
to-face instruction.”105 These beliefs about blended/hybrid learning may 
have some support. According to a 2010 U.S. Department of Education 
meta-analysis of online education studies,106 there was “an average of 35 
percent stronger learning outcomes for students taught in a blended format, 
as opposed to just face-to-face teaching.”107  
Blended learning can be advantageous because online material can 
supplement in-class instruction, allowing professors to spend more class 
time addressing misunderstandings and having the students apply the ma-
terial.108 For example, if the professor assigned a quiz for students to com-
plete online prior to class, the professor could look at the results and tailor 
a short in-class lecture to reteach the misunderstood material. If the pro-
fessor instead assigned the students a reading assignment and lecture out-
side of class, the students could bring their misunderstandings to the pro-
fessor’s attention in class. Blended learning also allows students to learn 
the content on their own schedule, revisit online material as much as they 
want, and control the pace at which they receive the information within 
the confines of due dates provided by the professor.109  
Students  participating  in  studies  have  commented  that  blended 
courses provide “opportunities for collaboration in online activities, in-
creased opportunities for students to receive feedback, and a different way

for students to participate in class discussions.”110 Furthermore, they note 
that they have better interactions with professors in blended courses than 
in pure classroom settings, citing the combination of “face-to-face com-
munication in class, frequent email exchanges, and frequent postings to 
the course discussion board.”111 Professors have noted that the format of 
blended courses (1) provides them with better access to students who have 
other obligations, like work and family; and (2) increases student engage-
ment because students have time to reflect more deeply on what they have 
learned before responding on a discussion board or submitting an assign-
ment.112 
However, blended learning does have its drawbacks. Blended learn-
ing requires substantial work on the front-end for professors in terms of 
planning which classes will be presented online, developing lectures, and 
creating as well as coordinating assignments for the online and in-class 
components.113 Students have noted that blended courses can be problem-
atic when there are technical difficulties on the course website, a professor 
is not quick to respond electronically to a student, or when fellow students 
working in a group fail to meet a deadline.114 Furthermore, because a 
blended course is not entirely online, students are still required to come to 
campus, removing some of the flexibility of fully online classes.115 Finally, 
some professors may simply “add online activities to an existing face-to-
face course” without decreasing the face-to-face classroom time, “result-
ing in an excessive workload that overwhelms students.”116  
Flipped classrooms are a type of blended, or hybrid, teaching model 
where the professor literally flips the activities that students do in the class-
room and at home: students receive instructional lectures online and com-
plete activities in the classroom to apply their knowledge.117 The professor 
may require that the students complete a reading assignment and watch a 
prerecorded lecture online that explains the material more in-depth before 
the classroom meeting.118 Instead of being used for a lecture, class time is 
then spent on student engagement with active learning activities, such as 
in-class quizzes and group problem-solving activities.119 For example,

criminal law students could be required to provide a sentencing or charg-
ing recommendation.120  
In the context of law schools, one professor observed that “[a]dopting 
a flipped classroom approach allows lawyering skills faculty to maximize 
the degree of in-depth instruction, the amount of practice students do under 
the instructor’s guidance, and the number of opportunities for students to 
engage in learning activities in the classroom.”121 Another professor re-
marked that the thoughtful infusion of online components into instruction 
can increase student engagement and enthusiasm both inside and outside 
the classroom,122 while yet another found the process of flipping a law 
classroom forces professors back into the shoes of students, allowing for 
more appropriate scaffolding.123 
Despite these benefits, there are also some downsides to the flip. Fac-
ulty who flipped their classrooms found they spent more time on class 
preparation because of the need to generate and upload online content, as 
well as to coordinate it with in-class activities.124 Initial work included 
“identify[ing] the topic of each module, plan[ning] how the module inte-
grates with what will happen during class, draft[ing] a script or de-
velop[ing] other materials for the module, develop[ing] competency in us-
ing the technology needed to create the video, and creating and editing the 
video.”125 However, some faculty who have used the flipped classroom 
approach, such as Dr. Landrum, see the initial time commitment as a “one-
time investment[]” because “[o]nce resources have been created, they can 
be used over and over again with little to no modification.”126 Others, 
though, may not see the benefits of the flipped classroom if students “do 
not put in the time required outside of class to be prepared for in-class 
activities.”127 
Some students find the flip helps them take more responsibility for 
their learning and increases their understanding because they have more 
access to the professor in the classroom, who is not using up all of the class 
time lecturing. Furthermore, students state that they are able to work with 
other students in groups during class time, and can rewatch video lectures

to better enhance their knowledge.128 Other students, though, find the tran-
sition to a flipped classroom difficult due to the greater responsibility and 
workload outside of the classroom compared to the traditional class set-
ting.129 For example, one law school professor at IU McKinney who used 
Team-Based Learning, a form of a flip, in a first-year class encountered 
some student resistance because it was the only first-year class not using 
the Socratic method and did not include PowerPoint slides like the other 
courses.130  
In short, the evidence suggests that whether a blended or hybrid 
teaching model, including a flipped classroom, is successful depends sig-
nificantly on the professor teaching the course. The strengths of this class 
format can be lost due to problems such as poor planning and organization 
by professors, and technical problems with the online component.131 For 
example, professors who have not taken the time to provide sufficient clar-
ity on assignments leave their students feeling frustrated,132 whereas 
“[s]tudents who have a clear sense of what the course plan is will be more 
likely to actively and positively engage in learning activities.”133  
C. Non-MOOCs Fully Online Courses 
Outside of MOOCs, universities may choose to provide two other 
types of completely online courses: synchronous online courses and asyn-
chronous online courses. Fully online and blended or hybrid online courses 
can be offered synchronously or asynchronously.134  
1. Synchronous Courses 
Synchronous online courses “occur on set schedules and time frames. 
Students and professors are online at the same time . . . [and] lectures, dis-
cussions, and presentations take place at specific hours. All students must 
be online at that same exact time to participate in the class.”135 Professors 
can broadcast lectures and run all other aspects of the course through 
online platforms such as “Adobe Connect, Blackboard Collaborate, We-
bEx, and Saba Centra.”136 These platforms offer file sharing among users, 
electronic whiteboards that both professors and students can use and view,

  129.  Simpson & Richards, supra note 109, at 165–66; see also Matamoros, supra note 56, at 126 
(explaining that some students felt that the “course took up considerably more time than if it were 
taught in a traditional manner, possibly to the detriment of their performance in other courses”).

chat features that allow for conversations between groups or individual 
users, computer microphones that permit discussions between the profes-
sor and a student, webcams, and the ability to save sessions for later view-
ing.137 These features mimic those of a traditional course but “from any-
where, without having to physically travel to a traditional classroom.”138 
Given the features available in online platforms, the professor in a 
synchronous online course can deliver a live lecture and call on a student 
like in a traditional classroom, and the students can interact with the pro-
fessor and each other through audio or chat features during the lecture.139 
The professor can also assess students’ through quizzes and written ex-
ams.140 Using an online platform, a professor can create an electronic quiz, 
proctor the quiz via webcams, and set an electronic due date.141 The pro-
fessor can use a similar structure for the submission of written exams, cre-
ating an electronic exam and requiring students to use webcams so that 
they can be monitored through the testing periods.142 Students can respond 
to the exam questions using a word processor program on their own com-
puter or a similar function in the online platform.143 
The benefits of synchronous online courses include the ability of pro-
fessors or students to participate in a course long-distance, and the oppor-
tunity for programs across multiple schools to jointly participate in a 
course.144 Given the online platform’s tools promoting communication, 
these courses can “provid[e] immediate feedback” similar to a traditional 
classroom. Students may enjoy this environment more than an asynchro-
nous course (discussed below) because of the “increased opportunity to 
interact with faculty and other students.”145 Students can also pose ques-
tions to the professor during a lecture using a chat feature instead of the

microphone, allowing the professor to remain uninterrupted while every-
one can see the question.146 Finally, saved recorded sessions of a synchro-
nous online class allow students to later review and enhance their under-
standing of the material.147  
However, these courses also present challenges for the professor, in-
cluding the unlimited accessibility provided by online platform features. 
For example, the chat feature enables students to submit potentially un-
limited questions during a lecture, requiring the professor to multitask be-
tween delivering instruction and monitoring a growing chat feed.148 Fur-
thermore, the use of a webcam does not allow the professor to simply point 
to call on a student, which requires a shift from a traditional classroom 
practice. There may be so many students participating in the course it 
could be difficult to see and track all of the students on the professor’s 
screen.149 There is also the possibility of technical issues for both the pro-
fessor and the students, so a professor should consider the type of institu-
tion or online platform support available to address those issues should 
they arise.150 Finally, the “work involved in teaching this type of class [can 
be] significantly greater than when teaching a live class.”151  
For the student, a major disadvantage is that synchronous online 
courses provide less flexibility for those with family or work obligations 
because there is a set schedule of when and how long lectures and other 
required log-in times will last.152 Yet, flexibility is what many students 
seek from an online course.153  
2. Asynchronous Courses 
Technological developments now allow schools to offer fully online 
asynchronous courses.154 The ABA has approved them, but has required 
that such courses include interaction that is similar in kind and quality to

that offered in live law classes.155 Asynchronous courses are the subject of 
our study.156  
Asynchronous online courses are “time-shifted” and consist of “read-
ings, recorded lectures, and student activities posted for students to ac-
cess.”157 In these courses, the students and professor do not meet in real 
time—online or otherwise.158 Rather, in an asychronous class, teaching and 
learning is conducted through an online platform (at IU McKinney, it is 
“Canvas”), with lessons organized by “modules” containing recorded 
lectures by the professor, readings, supplemental videos (such as portions 
of a documentary or videos from institutions like the United Nations), and 
student  activities.159  The  professor  assesses  student  learning  through 
regular student activities, which may consist of quizzes, discussion board 
posts,  research  assignments,  or  short  papers.160  The  professor  then 
provides feedback on those assignments through communication tools 
available on the online platform. While students must submit activities by 
a specific date, they can choose the exact day or time within the week to 
watch lectures, complete readings, and work on activites without attending 
a live classroom session.161 
Asynchronous courses are desirable because they provide flexibility 
to evening students with daytime commitments and to all students with 
packed schedules.162 As Professor Max Huffman explains, asynchronous 
courses allow students increased flexibility to, for example, finish their 
final semester in law school while also pursuing an externship in Brussels 
or Washington, D.C.—putting them at a competitive advantage in the

employment market.163 Asynchronous courses can also benefit students 
who are more comfortable writing than speaking because they have ex-
tended time to think before responding.164 Regular online assignments al-
low students multiple points of feedback, a rarity in law school where a 
student often only receives feedback from a final exam.165 Fully online 
asynchronous programs can also lower the costs of law school and permit 
more graduating students to pursue lower paying jobs in government or 
public service.166 Finally, the flexibility of asynchronous courses allows 
law schools to diversify their student bodies and recruit nontraditional stu-
dents, such as adult learners with careers and families,167 students with 
disabilities,168 and students from low socioeconomic backgrounds.169 
However, not all professors and students are sold on the concept of 
asynchronous course delivery in the law school context. Some students 
miss the live interaction and engagement of traditional or synchronous 
classes.170 Others in the legal field are dissatisfied with the fact that asyn-
chronous courses do not allow professors to teach using the Socratic 
method, which proponents consider an effective active learning teaching 
methodology.171 Critics of asynchronous courses also argue that the law 
school market is already saturated, and that fully online law schools are 
run by for-profit institutions seeking money instead of attempting to pro-
vide students with an education.172 Finally, an asynchronous course may 
not match everyone’s learning style.173  
Critics are right that the professor will not be able to use the Socratic 
method  in  an  asynchronous  class.  However,  employing  the  Socratic 
method is only one active-learning method that a professor can use to en-
gage students and encourage learning. There are many reasons to believe

that a professor or law school can use developing technology to deliver 
quality teaching and learning asynchronously in law school courses.174  
Studies show that the professor plays a large role in whether an online 
course delivers quality instruction to the student. In fact, a 2005 U.S. De-
partment of Education meta-analysis of online education studies found 
professor involvement in online courses to be the determinative factor in 
whether the online course was just as effective, if not more so, than the 
traditional face-to-face setting.175 It found that “[w]hen instructor involve-
ment was ranked as low, such as courses where students interact with the 
computer alone, face-to-face instruction was significantly more effective 
than distance instruction. Conversely, when instructor involvement was 
rated as medium or high, distance education was significantly more effec-
tive.”176 These findings should not be surprising because a successful live 
classroom experience also depends on a professor’s level of preparation 
for class and ability to manage the classroom environment in a way that 
encourages student learning and interest.  
III. RESEARCH DESIGN: THE IU MCKINNEY STUDY ASSESSING 
ASYNCHRONOUS ONLINE PROGRAMMING 
To assess the effectiveness of asynchronous online classes, this study 
draws on evidence from (1) anonymous student survey responses; and (2) 
focus groups with students. In both cases, the students responding were 
currently enrolled law students at IU McKinney.  
A.  Anonymous Student Surveys 
In terms of the survey responses, we collected data over a two-year 
period from more than 300 students in different sections of two different 
fully asynchronous online classes: Online Trusts and Estates and Online 
Comparative Law.177 A total of 283 of 316 students responded to the sur-
vey in Online Trusts and Estates during the Spring 2015, Spring 2016, and 
Fall 2016 semesters. A total of 43 of 64 students responded to surveys 
administered in Online Comparative Law during the Spring and Fall 2016 
semesters. Professor Ryznar taught all of the Online Trusts and Estates 
classes, and Professor Dutton taught all of the Online Comparative Law 
classes. Both classes were organized into modules and included short rec-

orded lectures by the professor and various activities to assess student un-
derstanding of the material. Some of those activities were similar—for ex-
ample, both Professors Dutton and Ryznar required students to complete 
quizzes.178 Some assignments, however, were only appropriate for certain 
types of classes. For example, in Professor Dutton’s course, students were 
required to write comparative analysis memos.  
The surveys to which students responded were “unofficial” mid-se-
mester surveys that were administered in an effort to receive anonymous 
feedback from students about the class in time for the professor to adjust 
the delivery and content if necessary. In contrast, the end-of-semester of-
ficial surveys were administered too late to allow such adjustments in re-
sponse to student feedback. Students were not required to fill out these 
mid-semester surveys; however, 85% of students did.179 
The surveys included a number of questions seeking student input 
about what was or was not working in the class generally. One question 
was specifically designed to learn the students’ overall impression of their 
online experience—it asked students: Would you take another “online” 
class in the future? Why or why not? This Article presents the data from 
student responses to that question below, exploring not only data on the 
percentage of students who responded positively or negatively to that 
question, but also why students reached their conclusions.  
The data received in response to this survey question reflects the per-
ception of IU McKinney students about online courses more generally for 
several reasons. First, more than 300 students responded to the survey 
questions about their online course experience. Second, the data was col-
lected over several different semesters, allowing for examination of stu-
dent perception over a period of time. Third, this study includes variation 
across courses and professors, allowing some conclusions about whether 
certain findings persist across that variation. For example, this study in-
cludes two different types of courses taught by different professors—
   
  178.  Quizzes are but one type of structured interim assessment that professors can use in their 
online courses. Quizzes can include various types of questions, such as multiple choice, true/false, fill-
in-the blank, and even short essay. See, e.g., Margaret Ryznar, Assessing Law Students, 51 IND. L. 
REV. 447, 450 (2018) (“The online learning platform is often able to grade objective quizzes such as 
multiple choice, and can even offer students immediate feedback by revealing the correct answers and 
explanations upon a student’s submission of the quiz. The professor, meanwhile, receives a computer-
generated report on student performance on that quiz once it closes,” allowing the professor to monitor 
students’ efforts at mastering course material).

Trusts and Estates is a “black letter law”180 course, while Comparative 
Law is a seminar-style course.181  
B.  Focus Groups 
To supplement and add depth to the data obtained from the anony-
mous surveys, this Article also includes data from focus group sessions 
designed to learn more about student perceptions of IU McKinney’s online 
programming that consists of online courses beyond Trusts and Estates 
and Comparative Law. The data reveals what online learning methods stu-
dents believe do and do not facilitate engagement and learning, and how 
they compare their online experiences to their live classroom experiences 
at the law school.182 In the focus group sessions, students were encouraged 
to interact with each other and discuss their experiences in online classes, 
with the goal being a much richer and detailed narrative than could obtain 
through the mid-semester surveys.183  
This study targeted for participation graduating students who had 
taken at least one asynchronous online course at IU McKinney because 
graduating students likely would be most willing to speak freely during 
the focus group sessions about their experiences in online classes. This 
group had little reason to be concerned about negative repercussions to 
their responses because their remaining exams would be graded anony-
mously and they were only a month from graduation.184  
Beyond targeting only graduating students, this study incorporated 
other measures to encourage students to speak frankly during the focus 
group sessions. First, students were told that while Professors Dutton and 
Ryznar were conducting the study, neither would be privy to the identity 
of students participating in the focus groups. Students were recruited for 
the focus groups by graduating student and author, Kayleigh Long. The 
focus groups were facilitated by Douglas Jerolimov from Indiana Univer-

ing.185 Dr. Jerolimov scrubbed the transcripts of the focus groups of any 
identifying student information before providing those transcripts to Pro-
fessors Dutton and Ryznar. In addition, Dr. Jerolimov, who is trained and 
experienced in facilitating focus groups, advised students that they should 
keep confidential the identity of focus group participants and the infor-
mation shared by those participants. Finally, Dr. Jerolimov told focus 
group participants that, to the extent they had any concerns about confi-
dentiality, they need not mention professors or courses by name when 
commenting during the sessions. Students were free to avoid answering 
any particular question or to leave the focus group entirely at any time. 
We held three different focus groups in April 2018, with four to eight 
students in each. The first was on April 11 at 3:00 p.m. (Focus Group 1) 
with six students, the second was on April 12 at 12:45 p.m. (Focus Group 
2) with eight students, and the third was on April 12 at 4:30 p.m. (Focus 
Group 3) with four students. Each session took place in a conference room 
at the law school and lasted between one and one and a half hours. Dr. 
Jerolimov videotaped each session, and the sessions were transcribed by 
an outside service.186 Students were offered no incentive to participate in 
the study, other than the opportunity to share their views about the current 
online programming and any suggestions for improvement. To help stu-
dents save time and to recognize their contribution to the project, each stu-
dent participant was offered a sandwich and beverage during the sessions.  
During the focus group sessions, Dr. Jerolimov used a script contain-
ing suggested questions designed to learn more about student perceptions 
of online classes at IU McKinney. Those questions specifically asked stu-
dents to compare their experiences in online classes with their experiences 
in live classes. For example, one question stated: “How do you compare 
the online experience to the live experience in terms of student engage-
ment—being engaged in learning the course material?” Another asked: 
“How do you compare the online experience to the live experience in 
terms of student learning—actually learning the course material? Do you 
feel students learn more or less in one environment or the other? Be spe-
cific about what learning was (or was not) improved, and why you think it 
was (or was not) improved.”187  
Additional questions were similarly focused on assessing the quality 
of online teaching and learning. Students were asked, among other things, 
what kinds of students they thought benefited most from online courses;

IV. STUDY RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
The extant studies assessing student perceptions of online courses do 
not point unequivocally to a conclusion that students view both online and 
live courses as delivering the same quality learning experience.188 Some 
studies on online instruction in the undergraduate and graduate contexts 
show students performing better in or preferring the online format.189 
Other studies show students performing better in or preferring the tradi-
tional classroom.190 For example, in one article, the authors report that un-
dergraduate student surveys conducted during 2012 and 2013 showed that 
   
  188.  As one author puts it, “Most of the studies have mixed results: on some of the measures, 
the students in the online or hybrid format did better, but on others they did worse, relative to students 
in the face-to-face format—or else, on some measures the online- or hybrid-format students did sig-
nificantly better or worse than the students in the face-to-face format, but on other measures there was 
no significant difference between the two groups.” KELLY A. LACK, CURRENT STATUS OF RESEARCH 
ON ONLINE LEARNING IN POSTSECONDARY EDUCATION 11 (2013).

the majority of students prefer live classes to online classes.191 Those au-
thors further reported that 32% of students in 2013, and 43% in 2012, felt 
that they learned less in online classes than in live classes.192 The authors’ 
conclusion, based on their survey results, is that “if given a choice [stu-
dents] would prefer the traditional classroom experience.”193  
That these studies do not unequivocally demonstrate the benefits of 
online teaching and learning, however, does not mean that we should dis-
miss online classes. As mentioned above, we do not expect that every stu-
dent will feel comfortable in the online environment. Also, some of the 
studies were conducted several years ago.194 Online classes are improving 
over time with technological developments that make the online learning 
platform more robust and user-friendly.195 Professors are also learning 
how to make their courses more engaging for students from their own trial 
and error—and from reading the pedagogical literature on online teach-
ing.196  
In short, we urge an open mind as to the future of online teaching and 
learning in the law school environment. Our own data suggests that online 
classes have a place in the law school curriculum, as the vast majority of 
students would take another asynchronous online class. Students also gen-
erally expressed the view that at least some of the online classes they have 
taken deliver a learning experience that is equal to or better than the learn-
ing experience they had in some traditional live law classes.  
Why do the students express this view? After reviewing the data, we 
conclude that quality matters in online teaching, just as it does in live 
teaching. In particular, the data shows that there are several key compo-
nents to the learning experience that will make students appreciate their 
online course. If professors design and deliver their online courses taking 
these factors into account, this Article predicts that students will perceive 
the courses as delivering a learning experience similar to the quality live 
courses they have taken.

A.  Anonymous Survey Results 
The vast majority of students responding to the anonymous surveys 
indicated that they would take another asynchronous online class. For Pro-
fessor Dutton’s Online Comparative Law classes, of the forty-one students 
who responded to the question about taking another online class, 85% an-
swered that they would. Arguably, this percentage does not fully capture 
students’ preference for online programming because some students were 
coded as nonresponsive to the question because they answered, in effect, 
“No, because I am graduating.” To the extent that students elaborated on 
their reasons for wanting to take another online class, they referenced the 
flexibility that the online course offered to them by allowing them to work, 
care for their family, and save time commuting while still learning and 
completing course work whenever and wherever they wanted.  
Of the 278 students responding to this same question in Professor 
Ryznar’s Online Trusts and Estates course, 74% said they would take an-
other online course. As with Professor Dutton’s class, this percentage does 
not fully capture students’ preference for online programming because 
some students simply responded, “No, because I am graduating,” and other 
students had more equivocal responses that they would take another online 
course depending on the type of course, the professor teaching the course, 
and the structure or layout of the online course. Responses indicated that 
students wanted to take more online courses so that they could learn at 
their own pace, access resources that they may not have in a traditional 
face-to-face class, have flexibility in scheduling (especially helpful for 
evening students and those with families), and forgo commuting to cam-
pus. 
That the vast majority of our respondents would take another online 
class should be encouraging to law schools considering investing in online 
programming. One can also conclude from the data that students respond-
ing to these survey questions believed that they had participated in a qual-
ity teaching and learning experience. Students did reference flexibility as 
a reason that they would be persuaded to take another online course, but 
they also mentioned that they would take another course depending on the 
professor teaching the course, the course’s organization, and the type of 
course being offered online. We also expect that law school students 
would not take a class simply because it allowed them some flexibility in 
their schedule. In fact, at least nineteen students, across both courses, vol-
unteered that they felt they learned just as much, if not more, than what 
they would have learned in a traditional classroom—and students were not 
asked this question in the anonymous survey.  
It is no surprise that students would identify the flexibility of online 
programming as important in their decision to take a class online. The lit-
erature on online programming highlights flexibility as a key advantage to 522  DENVER LAW REVIEW  [Vol. 96:3  
asynchronous online classes.197 Nor should one be surprised that law stu-
dents who work full-time or have families would appreciate the ability to 
complete lectures and activities when they can.198  
B.  Focus Group Results 
The focus group results are consistent with, and further elaborate 
upon, the mid-semester survey data. Students like the IU McKinney online 
programming, which goes beyond Online Trusts and Estates and Online 
Comparative Law, and would like more of it. This Section presents the 
focus group responses by theme and analyzes them accordingly. 
1. Student Engagement and Learning: Online Versus Live 
As to student engagement and learning, the most common student 
comment was that online and live classes both could offer more or less 
student engagement and learning depending on the topic being taught, the 
type of course, and the professor.199 In other words, students did not sug-
gest that online courses on the whole offered any less of an opportunity 
for student engagement and learning than did live classes. Several com-
ments help illustrate this point. One student stated: “I thought there was a 
lot of engagement in certain classes, and then in other classes there 
weren’t. Same thing with online.”200 The same student said that he or she 
has gotten a lot out of both in-person and live classes.201 Another student 
commented: “The more a teacher pulls me into it, the better. Some profes-
sors just haven’t done that. Same with the live courses as well.”202  
Many students highlighted the importance of quality teaching in their 
comments about online teaching and learning. For example, one student 
stated that “[t]he professor really is the key to any class, an in-person or 
an online. The professor’s knowledge of whatever the subject material is 
and the professor’s pedagogical style is really important.”203 Another also 
said that the professor teaching the online course played a large role in

depends on what the class is, who the professor is, and how the class is taught.” Yvonne M. Dutton &

whether the student viewed the course as a good learning experience.204 
This focus on the professor’s role is one that has also been highlighted in 
the literature.205 While Bergstrand and Savage found students preferred a 
traditional face-to-face sociology course over the same online course, they 
also found that,  
[T]he effectiveness of online courses depends on the instructor teach-
ing the course. It makes sense that the amount of time and energy put 
into an online course by an instructor . . . will impact the effectiveness 
of Web-delivered courses. Our research also suggests that the skill sets 
and traits of instructors could make some individuals better suited to 
teach online courses.206 
As to the relevant traits that may make a professor more successful, 
the authors mentioned the professor’s general public speaking abilities and 
specific ability to engage students.207 
Students in our focus groups also noted that the student plays a role 
in ensuring that the online environment is one in which he or she learns 
course material. In short, as long as the student is willing to do the work 
required by the professor, he or she can be engaged and learning in the 
online environment.208 One student noted that if the student did all of the 
work in the online class as required, “you’re getting either equal or greater 
amount of information versus if you were in an in-class setting.”209 An-
other student said,  
It would be hard for me not to recommend an online course to anyone 
because I feel like I’ve learned so much in the online courses. Again, 
it goes to the type of student that you are. If you’re somebody that 
you’re going to schedule out the time, you’re going to do the work, 
you’re going to make the effort, then . . . I’ve gotten out of each of my 
classes, I feel like, what I’ve put in.210  
A different student pointed out that if he or she was “doing all the 
reading and doing all the work assigned and showing up to all the classes 
   
  204.  See, e.g., Yvonne M. Dutton & Margaret Ryznar, Focus Group 2, at 13 (Apr. 12, 2018, 
12:45 PM) [hereinafter Focus Group 2] (unpublished transcript) (on file with authors) (Student 1: “It 
just all goes back to who is teaching the course, and how they structure it online.”).

  208.  Some students did note that different online courses had different levels of work required 
of them. By way of example, one student said that in a one-credit online course, he or she had more 
weekly assignments than he or she had in a three-credit online course. Focus Group 3, supra note 199, 
at 6 (Student 4). Another student said that he or she has been in online courses that were extremely 
difficult in terms of rigor and the amount of work required of the student, and some that required very 
little additional work from the student. Id. at 9 (Student 1). While we can consider ways to even out 
the amount of “rigor” in online classes, it is worth noting that live classes are not all the same in terms 
of rigor either. Students, in fact, made this point. See, e.g., id. (Student 3: “Just like all live classes are 
not the same, not every online class is the same either.”).

or watching all the videos that are available, I’m learning. If I’m not, I’m 
not learning.”211 On the other hand, a couple of students noted that they 
could get away with doing less in an online environment than in a live 
environment because they did not have the possibility of being called on 
by the professor.212  
A number of students, in fact, highlighted some benefits to the online 
course format as it relates to engagement and learning, and as it compares 
to live classroom learning. One student stated,  
For me, what I have enjoyed about online classes is that most of them 
have some sort of application portion for each lesson. I learn well from 
that, as opposed to reading, Socratic method, and then putting it all 
together whenever you have a minute to outline. The online classes for 
me I think have been more conducive to my learning.213  
Another similarly commented that the online classes tended to offer 
more “activities where you could actually apply what you’re reading or 
learning [to what] the lecture is on [which] really helps you learn.”214 An-
other pointed out that in contrast to live classes where “if you know you’re 
not going to be on call, [you can] go to class unprepared [and] sit back,” 
with an “online class, I think every time you do something with the class, 
you’re engaged.”215 One student suggested that he or she found little value 
in live classroom learning, stating that in live classes, “you show up for 
class, 10% of your grade is if you happen to be paying attention the day 
that you get called on, and then the rest is based off your final exam, but 
that’s it.”216  
Although many students highlighted how online classes offered them 
the opportunity to engage with the material because they had to complete 
regular assessments, some students did note that an aspect of live classes 
that they missed was the spontaneous interaction with the students and the 
professor—interaction that could contribute to learning. Along these lines, 
one student stated, “I think there is value to having the classroom experi-
ence, not only of having the professor be able to lecture to you on his or 
   
  211.  Id. at 4 (Student 2). Other students made similar comments about the student’s role in en-
suring he or she was engaged and learning. See, e.g., Focus Group 2, supra note 204, at 6 (Student 6: 
“I really just think it depends, and I don’t think my learning has been adversely affected by taking 
online classes versus in-person ones or vice versa. I think I just view the same thing regardless.”); 
Focus Group 3, supra note 199, at 3 (Student 4: “I think engagement depends on kind of with what 
effort you put into it and also the structure of the course itself.”). 
  212.  See, e.g., Focus Group 3, supra note 199, at 2 (Student 1, stating that he or she could put 
the lectures on a fast speed to watch them and could even answer some discussion questions and quiz 
questions without doing the reading); id. at 2 (Student 2: “Engaged in the process of doing posts and 
quizzes and things like that, but as for actual engagement in learning the material, like getting cold-
called in class or having to defend your position, kind of less engaged.”).

her expertise but also in being required to engage with other students in 
that setting.”217 Another noted,  
The couple of online classes I’ve taken, I’ve watched the lectures, I’ve 
done the readings, but for me, it’s not the same as when I can go and 
ask professors questions in an in-person setting. An online class, I 
might’ve done the reading about a particular case or statute, and then 
the professor will lecture over video. I don’t have the opportunity dur-
ing that video, when the professor is taking time to explain it, to actu-
ally ask more overarching or more nuanced questions.218  
Another said that he or she really felt more comfortable in the live 
setting, noting that,  
[E]ven if a professor’s lecturing, and not asking questions, I’m still 
kind of in a sense thinking questions I could be asking or asking ques-
tions myself. And I guess that process for me is how I learn, so even 
though online I can maybe email a question,219 it just feels like, just 
because I guess the device is there that it’s cut off, and it kind of throws 
me out of what I’m used to in terms of the Socratic kind of education 
and learning process it is that I kind of picked up through my school-
ing.220  
One student suggested that certain kinds of classes might be better in 
a traditional classroom because they require more in-person discussion to 
facilitate learning.221 
2. Components of a Quality Online Course 
According to the focus group students, the components of a quality 
online course included (1) organization, (2) engaging presentation of 
course content, and (3) opportunities for assessment and professor feed-
back. This Section elaborates on each of these components below, sharing 
not only student quotes but also the reasons why students identified these 
   
  217.  Focus Group 1, supra note 200, at 19–20 (Student 4). The student elaborated that he or she 
appreciated one professor in a 1L class who was really great at posing hypotheticals to “draw out 
obscure doctrines that you’re dealing with.” Id. That interaction with the professor, the student stated, 
helped him or her apply the subject matter and get live in-person feedback. Id. 
  218.  Id. at 3 (Student 4); see also Focus Group 3, supra note 199, at 4 (Student 1, stating that in 
online classes, you could not raise your hand to ask a question of the professor and that you “are just 
kind of stuck with what’s on that paper or what’s in that video”). 
  219.  Consistent with the student’s point that he or she could email the professor in an online 
course with questions, another focus group student mentioned that the professors he or she had for 
online classes offered opportunities for the students to ask questions of the professor either via discus-
sion posts or through virtual office hours. Focus Group 2, supra note 204, at 5 (Student 7). 
  220.  Id. at 6 (Student 4). 
  221.  The student said, “But I’ve also had classes that were more issues-based, I would say, where 
a lot of the learning process was in the discussion, and in the conversations back and forth, and I think 
it’s possible to have those in the online classes. I’ve had that in online classes. I don’t think it’s par-
ticularly effective, and I don’t think it’s particularly conducive to learning.” Id. at 7 (Student 8). 
 526  DENVER LAW REVIEW  [Vol. 96:3  
components as being crucial for a course to engage them in the learning 
process. 
Students stated that while organization was also important in live 
classes, an organized course presentation and clear signaling about expec-
tations were critical to their ability to learn well in the online setting. One 
student said,  
For me personally, like how much I’ve liked an online depends on how 
it was structured, because there’s then some classes where sometimes 
I have two quizzes, sometimes I have four quizzes a week, sometimes 
I have a discussion, sometimes I don’t, and then when you’re notified 
of that really makes difference, so I think structure is a huge influ-
ence.222  
Another echoed that thought, stating,  
I think a lot depends, as far as learning goes, depends on how the 
course is structured. Like, the first course I took, I put a lot of effort on 
my own part into it, but I also thought it was really well-structured as 
far as what was required each week and their explanations of what their 
expectations were for the assignments each week, and then their feed-
back for what you did.223 
In terms of engaging presentation of course material, students high-
lighted the benefit of short videos that were focused on a particular 
topic.224 One student explained it this way,  
But from what we know about the brain and the attention span, I think 
that those videos are particularly good for me because it was sort of a 
bite-size snapshot of this is what you can take in at this point in time. 
So, as opposed to a full two- or three-hour lecture, which is certainly 
hard to sit through. And, I think we drift in and out of that some-
times.225 
Students consistently mentioned that long and uninspired lectures did 
not enhance their learning experience in the online environment.226 One 
student explained why shorter lectures were more helpful. Specifically, the 
student could “watch a 20 minute one, one day, and then a 30 minute one 
the next, and then maybe [he or she will] sit for 15 or whatever” for the

the week in an online setting, and then had one of the formative assessments.”); id. at 5 (Student 1, 
stating that the student just gave up and got the worst grade in his or her law school career in an online 
class where the professor “literally read from the textbook for two hours”).

next video.227 In other words, “chunking” the videos makes it easier for 
students to do their work—they can watch short, focused videos on spe-
cific topics.228  
In addition, students pointed to formative assessments as a feature of 
a quality online learning experience, noting how they provided them an 
opportunity for a weekly check-in on the learning process.229 Comments 
showed a particular fondness for regular quizzes to help students assess 
whether they were on track learning course material.230 As one student put 
it, “I would much prefer the online, ungraded weekly quizzes. Give me a 
20 question quiz that I can just do to check to make sure that I’m under-
standing things.”231  
Students also emphasized how the professor’s use of practice-ready 
assignments in the online setting aided them in learning course material 
and helped them master practical skills. For example, one mentioned that 
online classes provided the opportunity to complete assignments similar 
to “an exam style question and doing substantive analysis work that in a 
live class, you might not do until you take the final.”232 Another com-
mented similarly, stating that in one online class, he or she had a “deliver-
able [that] could range to anything from a contract . . . to an email sent to 
a client.”233 The student emphasized how he or she appreciated this prac-
tice and how it differed from many live classes where the student only had 
the opportunity to read and answer a final exam question.234 The same stu-
dent explained that practical assignments, such as writing a memo, helped 
with engagement and learning. This is because those types of assignments 
required the student to learn something and “then . . . apply it to something 
that you will actually use or do in real life versus something that is all 
   
  227.  Focus Group 2, supra note 204, at 14 (Student 6). 
  228.  Another feature of engaging course content that students mentioned was supplementary 
learning material, such as the posting of relevant YouTube videos relating to course content. See, e.g., 
Focus Group 1, supra note 200, at 6 (Student 5, stating that he or she finds it helpful when professors 
put links to “[m]aybe a YouTube video or some sort of a clip” that helps drive home course content 
but that is “[not] necessarily from law school per se”); Focus Group 3, supra note 199, at 21 (Student 
4: “But like if they find something on YouTube that they want us to look at. Yeah, just any kind of 
video is always good I feel like.”). 
  229.  See, e.g., Focus Group 1, supra note 200, at 4–5 (Student 4: “Those weekly check-ins I felt 
really helped me learn the material in the same way that people have talked about.”). 
  230.  See, e.g., id. at 6, 17 (Student 2, stating that “the weekly quizzes that I have had in some 
courses have forced me to pay more attention to the reading than I otherwise might, which is something 
you don’t get in a live class” and that he or she “especially like[s] the quizzes that give you the answers 
as soon as you’ve submitted the quiz” because “you can also use that as learning material”); id. at 6 
(Student 3, stating that he or she “always found [quizzes in online classes] helpful as far as making 
sure that I learned what I needed to learn”).

  232.  Focus Group 1, supra note 200, at 6 (Student 2). That same student also said that “in the 
online classes, professors are able to find more ways to assign practical assignments, like client emails 
or drafting of a court document or something like that.” Id. at 9–10.

based on theory.”235 Another said, “I think my personal growth and devel-
opment in a lot of these online classes have been so much more substantial, 
just because of that time, being able to be spent doing practical [assign-
ments].”236  
Moreover, students commented that having to do regular formative 
assessments made their online classes more valuable than many of their 
live courses in terms of their professional development. For example, one 
student said that having the regular assessments and “getting that feedback 
throughout the semester is something you don’t get in 95% of the in-class 
courses here, and I think for me it has helped my learning and has solidi-
fied my understanding of the material in these classes, because I’m check-
ing myself along the way.”237 Another said that he or she finds live classes 
“to be a real waste of time, but in the online courses, it’s a little different, 
because you have a lot of practice assignments or discussion boards or a 
vast amount of resources at your disposal.”238 According to the student, 
these “practical” assignments in online classes “are so much more worth-
while than my ability to take a final exam [in a live class].”239 A different 
student made a similar comment, stating that he or she has really enjoyed 
the weekly assignments in online classes, 
[B]ecause typically in a live course, you don’t have graded assign-
ments on a regular basis. You have one final at the end of the semester. 
The ungraded weekly assignments in some of these online courses are 
a really great way to test your knowledge of the material and identify 
weak points.240  
Other students made similar comments about the value of the regular 
assessments and feedback available to them in online classes as compared 
to some of the live classes they had taken in law school.241 
Overall, students generally indicated that they would like to see more 
online programming.242 One student, in fact, stated that he or she would

people really do benefit from that kind of more constant feedback [in the online classes]. I know that 
that’s something that they’re trying to integrate into some of the live classes.”).

law school. See, e.g., Focus Group 3, supra note 199, at 27 (Student 1: “Yeah, I think they’re good. I 
mean there’s definitely some variation, but I think that overall, they’re good.”); id. (Student 2: “With

dent 3, comparing the online experience in a Master’s program to the IU McKinney online classes and

have been willing to take half of his or her classes online. The student 
stated, “I think I would’ve learned just as well, but I wouldn’t have been 
as stressed out because of the flexibility.”243 Others echoed that they would 
have taken more online classes had they been offered.244 Another student 
came back to the role that the professor plays in the online classroom set-
ting, stating that if the same professor was offering the same class live and 
online, the student would prefer to take the online class because it would 
allow the student to work or do internships.245 However, the student would 
not choose an online class solely for the flexibility it offered.246 Students 
did note that they did not think the law school environment would benefit 
from having all classes online because students liked the opportunity to 
engage with both fellow students and professors in the law school build-
ing.247 
Thus, the data from the focus groups is consistent with the results of 
some other studies on online learning in both the undergraduate or gradu-
ate setting. Elements of online instruction that students appreciate include 
respectful faculty,248 substantial interpersonal communications,249 an abil-
ity to easily share information250 and ask questions,251 flexibility in learn-
ing the material,252 and a course design that keeps students from falling 
behind.253 Most importantly, the value of an online course, and how it is 
perceived by students, depends on the professor’s ability to engage with 
the students over the Internet while remaining physically separated from 
the students. For example, Professor Lynn Clouder et al. found that when 
group interactions shifted from a face-to-face setting to an asynchronous 
online setting, the role of the online facilitator “cannot be underestimated” 
and that the professor serves “as a central feature of the model and a link 
from one context to the other.”254

CONCLUSION 
The research data from the IU McKinney study shows that law stu-
dents can be just as engaged and learn just as much, if not more, in an 
online course as a traditional classroom. The data shows that for these re-
sults to be possible, an online course and the professor running it must be 
organized, offer engaging content and lectures, and provide multiple op-
portunities for course assessment and professor feedback.255 While the stu-
dents in our surveys and focus groups are generally positively inclined to-
ward online teaching and learning, this does not mean that every graduate 
or undergraduate student will embrace the online environment. 
First, the students in the focus groups consistently stated that they 
believed that the students who do best in the online environment are those 
who are self-disciplined and focused on learning.256 This conclusion by the 
student participants is consistent with the literature that shows that ma-
turity and self-regulation play a role in whether one is motivated in the 
online environment.257 Much of the literature suggests that students with 
high levels of self-regulation and discipline are most likely to succeed in 
the online environment, where they must self-direct their learning pro-
cess.258 One study shows that students believe that to succeed in online 
courses, they must have high levels of personal responsibility and good 
   
  255.  See supra Part IV. 
  256.  See, e.g., Focus Group 1, supra note 200, at 12 (Student 1: “I think if you’re self-disciplined, 
online classes are really good for you. You’re very good at making yourself do the work and every-
thing. Even if there’s not a professor there watching or calling you out, if you’re self-disciplined 
enough to do everything you’re supposed to, then yeah. I think online classes is an easier choice for 
you.”); id. at 15 (Student 3, stating that he or she would tell self-disciplined students to take online 
classes because “[t]hey will probably get more out of it versus in an in-classroom setting. They’re 
learning more than what you would normally learn in the classroom versus somebody that’s not dis-
ciplined.”); Focus Group 2, supra note 204, at 10 (Student 7, stating that to succeed in an online class, 
“it kind of takes somebody that kind of stays on top of things to really be able to get involved and 
engaged and stay on top of it”); Focus Group 3, supra note 199, at 10 (Student 1, stating that for online 
classes, students need to “be really focused” and admitting that he or she is “not the most focused 
person on this planet or in this room”).

Courses: Differences Across Types of Students and Academic Subject Areas, 85 J. HIGHER EDUC. 633,

are also more likely to be successful in an online course).

late Their Learning with Hypermedia?, 29 CONTEMP. EDUC. PSYCHOL. 344, 362 (2004) (finding that 
students who engaged in self-regulating processes and strategies in a hypermedia environment per-
formed better than those who used less or no self-regulation); Lynch & Dembo, supra note 22, at 10

munity college online course with higher final grades”); cf. Barnard et al., supra note 22 (finding that 
“[o]nline self-regulatory learning behaviors were only weakly associated with better academic 
achievement by themselves” and self-regulation works best when combined with online communica-
tion and collaboration).

time-management skills.259 One might expect that, on the whole, law stu-
dents and other graduate students are more likely than undergraduate stu-
dents to be self-disciplined.260 Research also indicates that while the mo-
tivations for positive self-regulation may differ from student to student, it 
is important that professors who have positively self-regulated students 
provide an environment and activities that do not defeat that self-regula-
tion.261 
However, the research data also shows that even the students who 
prefer online courses for any number of reasons, and would self-select into 
an online course over a traditional face-to-face course, want those online 
courses to meet or exceed a traditional classroom’s quality.262 Some best 
practices for online teaching that those students are looking for include an 
organized structure and content flow, engaging lectures, materials that 
connect the content to the “real world,” and assignments that allow stu-
dents to check their understanding of the material and that are practical for 
when they graduate law school.263 Furthermore, they are looking for 
courses where the professor is not compensating for the lack of direct con-
tact by assigning work above and beyond what would be required in a 
similar credit hour traditional classroom.264 Instead, they want a realistic 
amount of work and the professor to engage them through lectures and 
other content, including useful practice-ready assignments on which they 
can receive feedback.265  
The ABA’s slow acceptance of online courses in law schools means 
that online teaching for many law professors is a new experience and a 
difficult balancing act, requiring them to abide by the ABA’s mandate that

APPENDIX A 
FOCUS GROUP GUIDE: ASSESSING STUDENT ENGAGEMENT AND 
LEARNING IN LAW SCHOOL ONLINE COURSES 
A.  Preliminary Comments 
Mr. Jerolimov will introduce himself and Ms. Long. He will provide 
potential subjects with the informed consent document. He will provide 
time to read the document and ask questions. He will answer any ques-
tions. He will collect all signed consent forms before beginning the FG 
session. Any student not wishing to participate after reading the consent 
form will be excused. 
After consent forms have been collected and any potential subjects 
excused, Mr. Jerolimov will briefly explain the mechanics of the FG ses-
sion. Namely, he will serve as the moderator posing questions that should 
be used to prompt conversation among the FG participants. This is not an 
interview; the goal is to stimulate interaction and thinking among the par-
ticipants.  
Mr. Jerolimov will also remind participants that he and Ms. Long will 
keep their identities and comments during the session confidential. He will 
also ask that participants not share information that occurred during the 
session with others so that everyone can feel confident in speaking freely.  
B.  Introductions of FG Participants 
Mr. Jerolimov will explain that participants will not be identified in 
any publications based on this research, nor be identified to Professors 
Dutton and Ryznar. Nevertheless, Mr. Jerolimov will ask participants to 
identify themselves by name so that Mr. Jerolimov and Ms. Long may 
keep records of the session. To ensure that participants meet the criteria 
for the study, he will also ask participants to state how many online courses 
they have taken at IU McKinney and when they took those courses.  
1.  What is your name?  
2.  How many online courses have you taken at IU McKinney?  
3.  During what year or years did you take online courses at IU 
McKinney?  2019]  ASSESSING ONLINE LEARNING IN LAW SCHOOLS  533 
C.  Online Versus Live for Student Engagement and Learning: Launch 
Questions to Stimulate Conversation and Interaction 
Before posing specific questions, Mr. Jerolimov will remind partici-
pants that the research does not require them to name particular professors 
and courses and that their comments can be more general in nature.  
He will also inform participants that their responses are neither right 
nor wrong; participants can also disagree with views expressed by other 
participants. 
1.  You have all taken at least one online class at IU McKinney and 
many live classes. How do you compare the online experience to 
the live experience in terms of student engagement—being en-
gaged in learning the course material? Be specific. (Again, there 
is no need to mention names or courses. You could mention types 
of activities in online or live classes that you feel do or do not 
enhance student engagement with the material instead.) 
2.  You have all taken at least one online class at IU McKinney and 
many live classes. How do you compare the online experience to 
the live experience in terms of student learning—actually learn-
ing the course material? Do you feel students learn more or less 
in one environment or the other? Be specific about what learning 
was (or was not) improved, and why you think it was (or was not) 
improved. (Again, there is no need to mention names or courses. 
You could mention types of activities in online or live classes that 
you feel do or do not enhance student engagement with the ma-
terial instead.) 
3.  As students who have taken one or more online classes at IU 
McKinney, do you have any views about whether the school’s 
online classes are more or less rigorous (however you wish to 
define that term) than the live classes at IU McKinney? 
4.  As students who have taken one or more online classes at IU 
McKinney, do you have any views about whether particular types 
of students benefit more or less from online or live classes in 
terms of student engagement or learning?  
D.  Online Programming Generally: Launch Questions to Stimulate 
Conversation and Interaction 
1.  As students who have taken one or more online classes at IU 
McKinney, do you have views as to the primary reasons why law 
students at this school may wish to take a class online—as op-
posed to live?  
2.  As students who have taken one or more online classes at IU 
McKinney, would you recommend that students take online clas-
ses at the law school? Why or why not? Be specific.  534  DENVER LAW REVIEW  [Vol. 96:3  
E.  Strengthening Online Programming Generally: Launch Questions to 
Stimulate Conversation and Interaction 
1.  As students who have taken one or more online classes at IU 
McKinney, what advice would you share to help make that pro-
gramming as strong as possible in terms of engaging students and 
enhancing student learning of material? In particular, are there 
any specific activities or teaching methods that you believe are 
particularly helpful to student engagement and learning in the 
online learning environment?  
2.  As students who have taken one or more online classes at IU 
McKinney, do you believe law students could benefit from more 
online programming? Why or why not? Be specific.  
3.  Students in online courses do the work on their own time. As stu-
dents who have taken one or more online classes, how were you 
motivated to do the work? Were you self-motivated? Or did the 
course structure or activities motivate you to do the work and 
learn the course material?
