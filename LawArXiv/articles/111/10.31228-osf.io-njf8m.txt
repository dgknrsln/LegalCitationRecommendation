 BURIED ALIVE: THE REBOOT OF THE EQUAL RIGHTS AMENDMENT 
Gerard N. Magliocca* 
 
Section 1. Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the 
United States or by any State on account of sex. 
 
Section 2. The Congress shall have the power to enforce, by appropriate legislation, 
the provisions of this article. 
 
Section 3. This amendment shall take effect two years after the date of ratification.1 
 
  In 2017, Nevada ratified the proposed Equal Rights Amendment (“ERA”) to the 
Constitution.2 This vote occurred thirty-five years after the expiration of the deadline set by 
Congress for three-fourths of the state legislatures to ratify the ERA.3 Nevertheless, the Nevada 
Legislature maintained that its action was not symbolic.4 The state argued that Congress could 
waive the expired deadline and declare the ERA the Twenty-Eighth Amendment whenever three-
quarters of the states (thirty-eight) ratify.5 Drawing on Nevada’s action and on the momentum 
for women’s rights created by the #MeToo movement, Illinois ratified the ERA in 2018.6  
  This Article argues that Congress can recognize the ERA as part of the Constitution 
despite the expiration of the ratification deadline in 1982. But Congress should not do so until

 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3201320 there is no doubt that thirty-eight states have ratified the ERA. There is room for doubt on that 
score because five states rescinded their ratification votes in the 1970s.7 Congress is probably 
free to disregard these rescissions on the ground that a state may not repeal its ratification of a 
proposed constitutional amendment.8 If these rescissions are disregarded, then the ERA stands 
just one state short of the thirty-eight needed for ratification. Ignoring these state rescissions in 
addition to waiving the ratification deadline, however, would raise substantial concerns about the 
ERA’s legitimacy and might lead a future Congress to contest that recognition. Accordingly, the 
wise course is for Congress to refrain from acting on the ERA until thirty-eight states can be 
counted as yes votes without the rescinding states.9 If Congress decides to include the rescinding 
states as part of the ratification total, then at least two-thirds of the Senate and the House of 
Representatives should be required to support that choice—in accord with the precedent set by 
Fourteenth Amendment—to quiet doubts about the validity of the ERA’s ratification.10   
  Even if either of these strict ratification standards is met, Congress must still weigh 
whether the expired ratification deadline should be waived. The ratification of the Twenty-
Seventh Amendment established that over two centuries can pass between an amendment’s 
                                                      
7 See KYVIG, supra note 3, at 408–09, 415 (listing the rescinding states as Idaho, Kentucky, Nebraska, Tennessee, 
and South Dakota). Some question if Kentucky’s rescission is valid because the state legislature’s resolution was 
vetoed by the Acting Governor. See Held, Herndon & Stager, supra note 5, at 134 n.124; Around the Nation: Acting 
Governor Vetoes Kentucky Rights Reversal, N.Y. TIMES, Mar. 21, 1978, at 20. This claim lacks merit. First, Article 
V refers to ratification by only state legislatures or state conventions and gives no role to state executives. See U.S. 
CONST. art. V. Second, I can find no practice in Kentucky or in any other state that gives the Governor a formal role 
in the Article V process. Third, the Kentucky Constitution states that the Governor plays no role in approving a 
proposed state constitutional amendment. See KY. CONST. § 256. Since the Governor is excluded from the amending 
process in Kentucky, there is no basis for thinking that the Governor can participate in the federal amending process.

Rescission of Its Ratification of a Federal Constitutional Amendment, 2 HARV. J.L. & PUB. POL’Y 233, 234 (1979) 
(providing an overview of this issue). 
9 Nothing prevents any of these five states from rescinding their rescission, but this Article proceeds on the 
assumption that none of them will.

 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3201320 proposal and its ratification.11 There are, however, distinctions between the Twenty-Seventh 
Amendment and the ERA that counsel against waiving the deadline, such as the greater potential 
breadth of the ERA and the unfairness involved in changing the rules after everyone thought the 
game was over.12 On the other hand, there are some arguments in favor of waiver, such as the 
potential popularity of adding an expression of sex equality in the Constitution and the belief that 
the ERA is necessary given the growing importance of originalism in our constitutional culture.13 
This Article takes no position on whether Congress should waive the ERA ratification deadline, 
as there is no way to predict the social, legal, and political conditions that will prevail when and 
if Congress faces that choice.   
  Part I provides some background on the ERA and on its recent revival in state 
legislatures. Part II defends the authority of Congress to impose and change a ratification 
deadline that is not included in the text of a proposed constitutional amendment. Part III argues 
that Congress should not exercise its discretion to dismiss the votes by five states to rescind their 
ratifications of the ERA, in part because the conclusion that a state vote for ratification is final 
cannot be sensibly reconciled with the conclusion that a national ratification deadline is not final. 
Part IV concludes by assessing some of the considerations that should guide Congress’s decision 
on whether to waive the ERA deadline and declare the text part of the Constitution.

 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3201320 PART I—A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE ERA (THUS FAR)  
  Until 2017, the conventional wisdom was that the ERA was dead.14 This Part explains 
why that conclusion was reached and how that opinion began unraveling after the ratification of 
the Twenty-Seventh Amendment in 1992. A key insight came from a 1997 law review article, 
which contended that the Twenty-Seventh Amendment meant that Article V proposals without a 
ratification deadline in their text can always be deemed ratified by Congress if three-quarters of 
the states concur.15 The ERA’s ratification time limit is not in the amendment’s text. Instead, the 
deadline (amended by a subsequent Congress) was in a joint resolution that was sent to the states 
along with the ERA.16 Twenty years after the 1997 article was published, Nevada implicitly 
adopted the paper theory by ratifying the ERA and by stating that Congress can make that text 
part of the Constitution.17 When Illinois followed in 2018, the ERA’s fate became a live issue.18  
A.  The Creation and Extension of the ERA Ratification Deadline 
  In 1972, more than two-thirds of each house of Congress voted to send the ERA to the 
States.19 Consistent with the practice followed by the previous four constitutional amendments, 
Congress placed a seven-year ratification deadline in the text of the joint resolution adopting the 
ERA.20 The “Joint Resolution Proposing an amendment to the Constitution of the United States 
                                                      
14 See KYVIG, supra note 3, at 468 (describing the expiration of the ratification deadline in 1982 as “a fatal 
stumbling block to the ERA”); Larry Kramer, Generating Constitutional Meaning, 94 CALIF. L. REV. 1439, 1444 
(2006) (referring to “the failed Equal Rights Amendment”); Ira C. Lupu, When Cultures Collide, 103 HARV. L. REV. 
951, 961 (1990) (describing “[t]he struggle, ultimately unsuccessful, over ratification of the Equal Rights 
Amendment”). By “dead,” I mean that that the ERA could not be formally ratified. The equality that the ERA 
sought to further fared far better through the Equal Protection Clause. See AKHIL REED AMAR, AMERICA’S 
UNWRITTEN CONSTITUTION: THE PRECEDENTS AND PRINCIPLES WE LIVE BY 295–96 (2012).

17 See S.J. Res. 2, 79th Gen. Assemb., Reg. Sess. (Nev. 2017). There is no doubt from the text of the recent Nevada 
and Illinois ratification resolutions that each state legislature believed that it was ratifying the ERA in the hope that 
Congress would waive the deadline. See id.; S.J. Res. Const. Amend. 4, 100th Gen. Assemb., Reg. Sess. (Ill. 2018).

ratified by the legislatures of three-fourths of the several States within seven years from the date 
of its submission by the Congress.”21 Following this preface, the joint resolution listed the text of 
the proposed ERA, which contained no ratification deadline.22 This structure contrasted with four 
constitutional amendments that included a seven-year ratification deadline in their actual text.23 
  In 1978, Congress amended the ERA joint resolution and extended the ratification 
deadline to ten years.24 This decision generated vigorous academic debate on whether Congress 
could extend the ratification time limit of a proposed Article V amendment when that limit was 
not in the amendment’s text, including a law review article by Professor Ruth Bader Ginsburg.25 
No states ratified the ERA in the extension period, but South Dakota did rescind its ratification 
as of the date when the original deadline expired due to the belief that the extension of time was 
wrong.26 When the new deadline expired in 1982, Congress chose to reintroduce the amendment

B.  The Twenty-Seventh Amendment and a Flash of Insight  
  In 1992, three-fourths of the states ratified a constitutional amendment proposed by 
James Madison during the first Congress.28 This proposal barred Congress from altering the 
salaries of its members during a given Congress.29 Contrary to dicta in a 1921 Supreme Court 
opinion that declared “quite untenable” the argument that a constitutional text could be ratified 
more than a century after being submitted to the states,30 Congress passed a joint resolution 
recognizing the Twenty-Seventh Amendment as part of the Constitution.31 Congress relied 
instead on a 1939 Supreme Court opinion, Coleman v. Miller, which held that the issue of 
whether too much time had elapsed for the states to ratify a proposed Article V amendment 
rested with Congress and could not be examined by the courts.32   
  While this validation occurred without much discussion, Senator William Roth of 
Delaware realized that Congress’s decision opened the door for a ratification of Article V 
amendments with expired deadlines. Roth told the Senate that the Twenty-Seventh Amendment 
                                                      
brief order by the Supreme Court. See Idaho v. Freeman, 529 F. Supp. 1107, 1153 (D. Idaho 1981), vacated as moot, 
Nat’l Org. of Women, Inc. v. Idaho, 459 U.S. 809 (1982). 
27 See Serena Mayeri, A New E.R.A. or a New Era? Amendment Advocacy and the Reconstruction of Feminism, 103 
NW. U. L. REV. 1223, 1224 (2009). In this case, Congress was exercising its discretion over the Article V process. 
The decision not to extend the ratification deadline in 1982 does not mean that Congress could not have done so.

31 See 138 CONG. REC. 11869 (1992) (Senate vote); id. at 12051–52 (House vote). Some scholars are critical of this 
decision. See, e.g., Prakash, supra note 11, at 8. To the extent that a future Congress takes this criticism to heart, the 
response may be to choose not to waive the ERA’s ratification deadline and compound the error made in 1992.

 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3201320 created “a very important precedent. Senate adoption of these resolutions means that a proposed 
constitutional amendment, once believed ineffective through the passage of time, can be revived 
and ratified.”33 The Senator added:  
If a proposed amendment need not be ratified by the requisite number of States 
contemporaneously, a fact we now declare by these resolutions, then why cannot 
the States ratify other long-forgotten amendments? Then why cannot the States 
ratify even the expired  amendments—those which  failed ratification before a 
congressionally imposed deadline—in the hope that Congress would later extend 
the deadline?34  
 
Why indeed? 
  The link between Senator Roth’s observations on the ratification of the Twenty-Seventh 
Amendment and the ERA was picked up five years later in a law review article (subtitled Why 
the ERA Remains Legally Viable and Properly Before the States) co-authored by three law 
students.35 While the paper’s substantive arguments are assessed in Part II, a key point was that 
the Twenty-Seventh Amendment established that there was no unwritten constitutional norm 
barring the ratification of an amendment because too much time had passed between its proposal 
by Congress and the affirmative votes of three-fourths of the states.36 Without such a norm, the 
article argued, nothing prevented Congress from changing the ERA ratification deadline again so 
that the amendment could be ratified.37 The article provided the underpinning for the “Three-
State Strategy,” which rested on the premise that the ERA needed three more state ratifications to

C.  The Nevada and Illinois Ratifications of the ERA 
The “Three-State Strategy” was purely academic until Nevada voted to ratify the ERA in 
2017.39 In its joint resolution explaining the decision, the State endorsed the logic of Senator 
Roth and the 1997 law review article. After restating the text and history of the ERA, the 
resolution stated that “[t]he Congress of the United States adopted the 27th Amendment to the 
Constitution of the United States, which was proposed in 1789 by our First Congress but not 
ratified by three-fourths of the States until May 7, 1992, and, on May 18, 1992, certified as the 
27th Amendment.”40 Next, Nevada opined that “[t]he restricting time limit for ratification of the 
Equal Rights Amendment is in the resolving clause and is not part of the amendment which was 
proposed by Congress and which has already been ratified by 35 states.”41 Then, “[h]aving 
passed a time extension for the Equal Rights Amendment on October 20, 1978, Congress 
demonstrated that a time limit in a resolving clause may be disregarded if it is not part of the 
proposed amendment.”42 A statement of the Court’s holding in Coleman followed,43 which led to

ALICE PAUL INST., https://www.equalrightsamendment.org/ratification-1/ (last visited June 20, 2018) (providing 
background on the three-state strategy). 
39 In 2013, the New Mexico Senate passed a resolution urging that state’s congressional delegation to vote in favor 
of waiving the ERA’s deadline. See S. Mem’l 7, 51st Leg., 1st Sess. (N.M. 2013). This resolution provided a brief 
summary of the “Three-State Strategy.” See id. (“[T]he deadline for ratification is not in the binding text of the 
document itself and, in fact, was later extended by another congress for an additional three years, thus establishing 
the precedent that congress has the power to do so.”).  
40 S.J. Res. 2, 79th Gen. Assemb., Reg. Sess. (Nev. 2017). 
41 Id. The claim that 35 states had ratified the ERA prior to Nevada rests on the assumption that the five rescinding 
states should still be counted as ratifying states. See KYVIG, supra note 3, at 408–09 (pointing out that thirty states 
ratified the ERA in the first year after its proposal, but only five did thereafter, while four others rescinded prior to 
the extension of the deadline); id. at 415 (noting the rescission by South Dakota after the extension was passed by 
Congress). 
42 Nev. S.J. Res. 2. 
43 Id. (“The United States Supreme Court in Coleman v. Miller, 307 U.S. 433 (1939), recognized that Congress is in 
a unique position to judge the tenor of the nation, to be aware of the political, social and economic factors affecting 
the nation and to be aware of the importance to the nation of the proposed amendment . . . .”).

 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3201320 the conclusion that “it is for Congress, under the principles of Coleman v. Miller, to determine 
the validity of the state ratifications occurring after a time limit in the resolving clause, but not in 
the amendment itself.”44 Last, the joint resolution stated that “the present political, social and 
economic conditions demonstrate that constitutional equality for women and men continues to be 
a timely issue in the United States.”45  
In May 2018, Illinois ratified the ERA.46 The Illinois Joint Resolution closely tracked 
Nevada’s reasoning with two exceptions. First, the resolution stated: “The founders of our 
nation, James Madison included, did not favor further restrictions [in other words, time limits on 
ratification] to Article V of the Constitution of the United States, the amending procedure; the 
United States Constitution is harder to amend than any other constitution in history . . . .”47 
While the claim about “any other constitution in history” is highly questionable, the fact that the 
Constitution is hard to amend is a fact that Congress may consider when addressing the ERA’s 
ratification.48 Next, the resolution said: “[E]quality for women and men continues to be timely in 
the United States and worldwide, and a number of other nations have achieved constitutional 
equality for their women and men . . . .”49 The point about the inclusion of sex equality in other 
national constitutions could also influence Congress’s judgment on ratification down the road if 
consistency with other liberal democracies is viewed as an important objective.50

fact could cut either way. The difficulty of amendment could be invoked as a reason to waive the deadline on the 
ground that too often the popular will is thwarted by Article V. Or the idea could be that the Constitution should be 
difficult to amend and no leeway should be given to Congress to undo the decision of a prior Congress on the ERA.

 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3201320 In sum, there is an active social movement seeking the ERA’s ratification. But the lofty 
rhetoric from Nevada and Illinois will count for little if Congress lacks the authority to revise the 
ERA’s expired ratification deadline. Let us therefore turn to that pivotal question.

  This Part assesses whether Congress can declare the ERA part of the Constitution if 
three-fourths of the states ratify the proposal. The answer is yes. My conclusion rests on an 
analysis of the text, history, and case law on the Article V process, which all imply that a 
ratification deadline not in the text of a proposed constitutional amendment can be altered by 
Congress at any time. In the ERA’s case, Congress has already changed the deadline once by a 
majority vote in each chamber, which suggests that there is no barrier to doing so again through 
the proper form of a joint resolution.   
A.  The Implied Power of Congress to Set a Deadline 
  The first question that must be addressed is whether the ERA ratification deadline is 
constitutional. While there is clear authority from the Supreme Court that Congress may include 
such a deadline in the text of an Article V amendment, there is no such authority about the power 
of Congress to do this via a joint resolution.51 Furthermore, no power to impose a ratification 
deadline is stated in the Constitution. The power must be implied from Article V or from the 
Necessary and Proper Clause, as interpreted in M’Culloch v. Maryland.52 In effect, the argument 
would be that setting a time limit is a reasonable means by which Congress was implementing 
the enumerated end of proposing amendments to the states.53 
                                                      
51 See Dillon v. Gloss, 256 U.S. 368, 375–76 (1921); Held, Herndon & Stager, supra note 5, at 127. Under the 
Court’s subsequent analysis in Coleman, there are serious doubts about whether the constitutionality of a joint 
resolution time limit is justiciable. See infra text accompanying notes 76–80.  
52 17 U.S. (4 Wheat.) 316 (1819); see U.S. CONST. art. I, § 8, cl. 18. There is nothing about the original  public 
meaning of Article V that sheds light on this question. 
53 See M’Culloch, 17 U.S. (4 Wheat.) at 408–10. Another way of putting this is that a time limit is just a procedural 
requirement rather than a substantive act. 
  10 
 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3201320   One point in favor of Congress’s implied authority for using a joint resolution to set a 
ratification deadline is that this was done for Article V amendments other than the ERA.54 And 
there is no indication that constitutional objections were raised to the inclusion of a deadline in 
this fashion. To be fair, though, the practice of placing ratification deadlines in a joint resolution 
was relatively brief and came at a time when the limits on Congress from enumeration were 
taken less seriously than they are today.55 (Congress has not sent an Article V amendment to the 
states since 1978, so there is no relevant practice since then.) As a result, nothing bars Congress 
from concluding that there was no legislative authority to impose the ERA’s time limit in the 
first place and declaring the expired deadline null and void.56      
  Nevertheless, the argument that Congress lacks the power to impose a ratification time 
limit through a joint resolution is not convincing. Recent Supreme Court decisions that read the 
Constitution’s enumerated powers more rigorously do so largely to protect state sovereignty and 
prevent Congress from assuming a police power.57 Imposing a deadline on the ratification of an 
Article V amendment is, by contrast, a narrow exercise of authority that does not raise the 
prospect of a slippery slope towards a police power. Nor is state sovereignty affected by such a 
requirement. The states are free to ratify proposed amendments after a congressional deadline 
expires, as Nevada and Illinois have done with the ERA. More important, state sovereignty is 
more constrained in the Article V process than in other contexts, as Congress selects the mode of 
state ratification (legislatures or conventions) and the text of the proposal that the states may vote 
                                                      
54 See infra text accompanying note 56. 
55 See United States v. Lopez, 514 U.S. 549, 567–68 (1995) (launching a new era of judicial scrutiny for enumerated 
powers).  
56 In other words, if Congress decides to waive the ERA’s ratification deadline, that could be done on the ground 
that using a joint ratification to impose one was not valid, rather than on the ground that Congress is free to change 
such deadlines. 
57 See Nat’l Fed’n of Indep. Bus. v. Sebelius, 567 U.S. 519, 534–36 (2012); United States v. Morrison, 529 U.S. 
598, 615–19 (2000); Lopez, 514 U.S. at 564.

limit on the states via a joint resolution.         
B.  The Textual Argument for Authority to Change a Deadline 
  The next question is whether the text of Article V and some of the constitutional 
amendments support Congress’s authority to change a time limit for ratification and, if so, when? 
An obvious difference between the ERA and four other amendments that were adopted is that 
there is no ratification deadline in the text of the ERA itself.59 The Eighteenth, Twentieth, 
Twenty-First, and Twenty-Second Amendments each state that the text would be “inoperative” 
unless ratified within seven years.60 Beginning with the Twenty-Third Amendment, the seven-
year ratification timeframe was moved into the joint resolution Congress proposed alongside the 
amendment.61 While the reason for this switch is not clear,62 the placement of the deadline in the 
ERA’s joint resolution was part of the rationale for the extension of its ratification deadline by 
Congress in 1978.63 Joint resolutions, of course, can be amended or repealed by Congress just 
like ordinary statutes.64 
                                                      
58 See, e.g., Hawke v. Smith, 253 U.S. 221, 230 (1920) (“[T]he power to ratify a proposed amendment to the federal 
Constitution has its source in the federal Constitution. The act of ratification by the state derives its authority from 
the federal Constitution to which the state and its people have alike assented.”) 
59 See H.R.J. Res. 208, 92d Cong., 2d Sess., 86 Stat. 1523 (1972). 
60 See supra note 23. Prior to the Eighteenth Amendment, no ratification time limits were imposed on Article V 
proposals. See Dillon v. Gloss, 256 U.S. 368, 371–72 (1921).   
61 See S.J. Res. 7, 92nd Cong., 1st Sess., 85 Stat. 825 (1971) (Twenty-Sixth Amendment proposal); S.J. Res. 1, 89th 
Cong., 1st Sess., 79 Stat. 1327 (1965) (Twenty-Fifth Amendment proposal); S.J. Res., 87th Cong., 2nd Sess., 76 
Stat. 1259 (1962) (Twenty-Fourth Amendment proposal); S.J. Res. 39, 86th Cong., 2nd Sess., 74 Stat. 1057 (1960) 
(Twenty-Third Amendment proposal).  
62 Style is the most likely explanation. Congress may have wanted to avoid the inclusion of text that would become 
superfluous once a constitutional amendment was ratified. See Rees, supra note 25, at 918 (quoting Noel Dowling, a 
Columbia Law School Professor, who gave this reason for the change when the Twenty-Third Amendment was 
proposed). There is no indication that Congress moved ratification deadlines to joint resolutions so that they could 
be amended.   
63 See KYVIG, supra note 3, at 414–15; Ginsburg, supra note 25, at 923–24; Held, Herndon & Stager, supra note 5, 
at 128–30.  
64 Cf. Held, Herndon & Stager, supra note 5, at 130 (“As the proposing clause is merely legislative, the time limit 
can be changed if Congress exercises its power to adjust, amend, or extend its own legislative action with new 
legislative action.”).  
  12 
 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3201320   The argument that Congress cannot alter a ratification deadline in a joint resolution for an 
Article V amendment would mean that there is no difference between including that limit in a 
joint resolution or in an amendment. To say that putting something into a proposed Article V 
amendment as opposed to elsewhere is meaningless is a strange notion for a textualist. Indeed, 
Congress implicitly rejected that idea in 1978 when proposing an Article V amendment to give 
the District of Columbia voting members in the Senate and in the House of Representatives.65 
This representation proposal (which was not ratified by the states) was made while the ERA 
extension was pending and was changed to place the ratification deadline into the amendment 
itself to make clear that the ratification period could not be altered by Congress.66  The text of the 
ERA also implicitly rejects a reading holding that the placement of a deadline in the text of the 
amendment is immaterial.67 Section Three states that the ERA will not take effect until two years 
after ratification.68 This transition period indicates that Congress was quite capable of including 
timetables in the text of the amendment, thus barring a subsequent Congress from changing them 
without a new Article V amendment proposal. With respect to the ratification deadline, though, 
Congress declined to do so. 
The leading counterargument is that joint resolutions prefacing a constitutional 
amendment are different because they are enacted pursuant to Congress’s Article V power and 
hence need the same supermajorities that are necessary to send an amendment to the states for 
                                                      
65 See H.R.J. Res. 554, 95th Cong., 2d Sess., 92 Stat. 3795 (1978).  
66 See id. (“Sec. 4. This article shall be inoperative, unless it shall have been ratified as an amendment to the 
Constitution by the legislatures of three-fourths of the several States within seven years from the date of its 
submission.”); id. (providing in the Joint Resolution that the D.C. Representation Amendment would be valid “when 
ratified by the legislatures of three-fourths of the several States within seven years from the date of its submission by 
the Congress”); see also KYVIG, supra note 3, at 421 (quoting the House Judiciary Committee Report, which stated 
that “[t]he effect of placing this time limit in the text of the amendment prohibits subsequent Congresses from 
deciding to extend the time allowed for ratification”).  
67 See Held, Herndon & Stager, supra note 5, at 129–30. 
68 See supra text accompanying note 1. 
  13 
 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3201320 ratification.69 At most, though, this means that Congress can change such a joint resolution, but 
only if more than two-thirds of each House concurs.70 An even stronger view is that such an 
extension would wipe out prior state ratifications and reset the total to zero.71 But that claim 
collapses the distinction between including a ratification deadline in a joint resolution instead of 
the amendment’s text. In other words, Congress is free to propose an Article V amendment a 
second time (as was attempted with the ERA in 1983).72 If that succeeds, then the new proposal 
would start with zero state ratifications. Holding that a ratification deadline extension does the 
same thing would mean there is no difference between an extension and a full-blown second 
proposal. Maintaining that a supermajority in each House is required for an extension but that an 
extension does not nullify prior state ratifications at least preserves the distinction between the 
joint resolution and the text while also acknowledging that Article V joint resolutions are unique. 
When the inquiry turns to Article V itself, there is no support for the proposition that 
ratification timetables require a two-thirds vote in each House of Congress. The only procedure 
mentioned in Article V is the mode of ratification, with the choices being state legislatures or 
state ratifying conventions.73 Congress has always mustered more than a two-thirds vote for the 
ratification mode and placed that detail in a joint resolution rather than in the text of a proposed 
amendment.74 Whether a supermajority is required for the ratification mode need not be

amendments proposed by the First Congress); see also S.J. Res. 7, 92d Cong., 85 Stat. 825 (1971) (Twenty-Sixth

 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3201320 addressed here. The point is that there is nothing in the text of Article V that supports such a 
special rule for a ratification timeframe, in part because the Framers did not contemplate that 
proposed amendments would have a ratification deadline. 
C.  Congressional Practice Under Supreme Court Doctrine 
Another flaw in the argument that ratification deadlines in a joint resolution may not be 
changed or may be changed only by a two-thirds vote in each House is that Congress changed 
the ratification period of the ERA by a majority vote.75 The degree to which Congress should be 
bound by its own precedents is undertheorized when compared to the issue of stare decisis for 
courts,76 but the most straightforward approach is to treat a prior relevant congressional action as 
creating a presumption of validity that a subsequent Congress can reject. This conclusion draws 
on the Supreme Court’s reasoning in Coleman, which explained that two aspects of the Article V 
process present political questions for Congress.  
In Coleman, the Supreme Court held that Congress was the final authority on whether a 
proposed constitutional amendment could still be ratified when no time limit was included in the 
                                                      
Res. 14, 72nd Cong., 47 Stat. 745 (1932) (Twentieth Amendment proposal); H.R.J. Res. 1, 66th Cong., 41 Stat. 362

proposal); H.R.J. Res. 39, 62d Cong., 37 Stat. 646 (1912) (Seventeenth Amendment proposal); S.J. Res. 40, 61st 
Cong., 36 Stat. 184 (1909) (Sixteenth Amendment proposal); H.R.J. Res. 14, 40th Cong., 3d Sess., 15 Stat. 346 
(1869) (Fifteenth Amendment proposal); H.R.J. Res. 48, 39th Cong., 1st Sess., 14 Stat. 358 (1866) (Fourteenth 
Amendment proposal); H.R.J. Res. 11, 38th Cong., 2d Sess., 13 Stat. 567 (1865) (Thirteenth Amendment proposal);

Sess., 1 Stat. 402 (1794) (Eleventh Amendment proposal).The First Congress established the precedent for 
designating the mode of state ratification in the joint resolution rather than in the text of a proposed Article V 
amendment. See MAGLIOCCA, supra note 4, at 44–45.  
 
75   See Ginsburg, supra note 25, at 929; see also KYVIG, supra note 3, at 415 (listing the vote totals in the 
House of Representatives and in the Senate).  
 
76   See Mark Tushnet, Legislative and Executive Stare Decisis, 83 NOTRE DAME L. REV. 1339, 1341–50 
(2008). Tushnet’s article is one of the few that discuss on how precedent should operate within Congress, whereas 
there are many articles on the issue for the courts. See, e.g., Richard H. Fallon, Jr., Stare Decisis and the 
Constitution: An Essay on Constitutional Methodology, 76 N.Y.U. L. REV. 570, 570–73 (2001); Henry Paul

by Congress in 1924 (without a ratification deadline in the amendment’s text or in its joint 
resolution) but was never ratified.78 On the issue of whether too much time had passed for the 
states to ratify the amendment, the Court stated:  
[T]he question of a reasonable time in many cases would involve, as 
in this case it does involve, an appraisal of a great variety of relevant 
conditions, political, social and economic, which can hardly be said 
to be within the appropriate range of evidence receivable in a court 
of justice.79  
 
“On the other hand,” the Court added:  
[T]hese  conditions  are  appropriate  for  the  consideration  of  the 
political  departments  of  the  Government.  The  questions  they 
involve are essentially political and not justiciable. They can be 
decided by the Congress with the full knowledge and appreciation 
ascribed  to  the  national  legislature  of  the  political,  social  and 
economic conditions which have prevailed during the period since 
the submission of the amendment.80  
 
Thus, “the Congress in controlling the promulgation of the adoption of a constitutional 
amendment has the final determination of the question whether by lapse of time its proposal of 
the amendment had lost its vitality prior to the required ratifications.”81 
                                                      
77   Coleman v. Miller, 307 U.S. 433, 456 (1939). Four Justices took the view that the Article V “process itself 
is ‘political’ in its entirety, from submission until an amendment becomes part of the Constitution, and is not subject 
to judicial guidance, control or interference at any point.” Id. at 456, 459 (Black, J., concurring). Chief Justice 
Hughes wrote the opinion of the Court, which was joined by only two other Justices, which addressed the 
justiciability of only the specific issues raised in the litigation. Id. at 435, 446–56 (majority opinion). 
 
78   See Gerard N. Magliocca, Court-Packing and the Child Labor Amendment, 27 CONST. COMMENT. 455, 
457–61 (2011) (providing an overview of the debate on that amendment). 
 
79   Coleman, 307 U.S. at 453. The contrary view, expressed in Dillon v. Gloss, that the question of a 
reasonable time was justiciable was dismissed as dictum. See id. at 452–53. 
 
80   Id. at 454. 
 
81   Id. at 456; see Held, Herndon & Stager, supra note 5, at 130–31 (citing Coleman to support the argument 
that Congress may waive the ERA ratification deadline). 
 
  16 
 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3201320   Coleman yields two relevant lessons for the ERA. One is that Congress is charged with 
deciding if a proposed Article V amendment can still be ratified by the states so long as the 
amendment itself contains no ratification deadline. This was the understanding that Congress 
relied on in declaring the Twenty-Seventh Amendment part of the Constitution, even though 
more than two centuries had passed since the First Congress made the proposal.82 The other is 
that the Supreme Court is very unlikely to second-guess Congress’s construction of its Article V 
authority.83 For the ERA, Congress’s construction was that a ratification deadline in a joint 
resolution can be modified by a majority vote. Congress can rely on that precedent to waive the 
ERA’s ratification deadline via a simple majority.84  
  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *      
  If Congress chooses to waive the ERA’s ratification deadline, then the appropriate form 
for that action would be a joint resolution much like the one used to extend the deadline in 1978. 
Like other joint resolutions, this hypothetical one would be subject to a filibuster (requiring sixty 
                                                      
82   Coleman, 303 U.S. at 454–56. There is also a valid argument (that I need not address here) that the 
ratification of the Twenty-Seventh Amendment was self-executing, given that there was no ratification deadline in 
the proposal made by the First Congress. 
 
83   Coleman, 303 U.S. at 456. Let me briefly discuss the vitality of Coleman given the retreat of the political 
question doctrine since the 1930s. See, e.g., Rachel E. Barkow, More Supreme Than Court? The Fall of the Political 
Question Doctrine and the Rise of Judicial Supremacy, 102 COLUM. L. REV. 237, 263–73 (2002); see also Baker v. 
Carr, 369 U.S. 186, 232–34 (1962) (rejecting the political question doctrine in the context of legislative 
apportionment). Questions pertaining to the Article V process present an especially compelling case for 
nonjusticiability given the conflict of interest that is often present for courts. Some proposed amendments are 
expressly intended to overrule a Supreme Court decision See U.S. CONST. amend XIV, § 1 (overruling Scott v. 
Sandford, 60 U.S. 393, 427 (1857) by declaring that all persons born in the United States (including African-
Americans) were citizens of the United States). Thus, permitting the Court to rule on the validity of the process used 
to ratify an amendment could be seen as an attempt to thwart the prerogative of “We the People” to assert their 
constitutional sovereignty. In any event, the Court has displayed no interest in revisiting Coleman, in spite of the 
ratification or proposal of many Article V amendments since 1939.  
  
84   Congress could decide to reject the 1978 precedent and require a greater than two-thirds vote to waive the 
ratification deadline. In practice, this could occur if Congress applies the same supermajority threshold to a vote on 
rejecting the five state rescissions of the ERA as part of a deadline extension. See infra notes 113, 115–16 and 
accompanying text; see also supra note 1 and accompanying text.

omission of any reference to the Executive Branch in Article V and with longstanding tradition, 
the President would not need to sign and could not veto such a resolution.86 Congress could act 
before three-fourths of the states ratify the ERA or wait until that magic number is met. But how 
will Congress know if thirty-eight states have ratified the amendment? This question is usually 
simple arithmetic, but not for the ERA.   
PART III—THE PROBLEM OF STATE RESCISSIONS 
 
  This Part considers whether Congress should count--as part of the three-quarters total 
required by Article V—five states that ratified the ERA but later rescinded those votes. There is 
virtually no doubt that Congress can count these states as “yes” votes, as Coleman held that state 
ratification rescissions also present a political question.87 Whether Congress should take that step 
and, if so, by what voting rule, is a far more complicated question that encapsulates the dilemma 
presented by the ERA’s undead status: Is it dirty pool for Congress to make this amendment part 
of the Constitution in the presence of state rescissions and a long-expired ratification deadline? 
The answer is a qualified yes, which leads to my view that Congress should not count the five 
rescinding states in the yes column. If Congress decides that they should be counted, then that 
                                                      
85   See U.S. SENATE COMM. ON RULES AND ADMIN., STANDING RULES OF THE SENATE, S. DOC. NO. 110-9, at 
15–17 (2007) (Rule XXII(2)) (stating that cloture may be invoked with sixty votes on “any measure, motion, other 
matter pending before the Senate”). No attempt was made to filibuster the extension of the ERA’s ratification 
deadline in 1978, but that may just reflect the fact that Senate filibusters were less common then.  
 
86   See, e.g., Jimmy Carter, Remarks on Signing H.J. Res. 638, in 2 PUBLIC PAPERS OF THE PRESIDENTS OF THE 
UNITED STATES, 1800, 1800–01 (1979) (“As is well known, the Constitution does not require that the President sign 
a resolution concerning an amendment to the Constitution of the United States.”). The view that the President plays 
no role in the Article V process dates back to a statement from Justice Samuel Chase during oral argument in a 1798 
Supreme Court case, see Hollingsworth v. Virginia, 3 U.S. 378, 381 n* (1798), though one could say that President 
Washington established the custom during the First Congress when what became the Bill of Rights was proposed 
with no formal action by him.

Senate, in line with past practice. 
A.  The Reconstruction Precedent  
  There is scant authority on whether a state can withdraw its ratification of an Article V 
amendment.88 Neither Congress nor the Supreme Court recognizes the right of a state to 
rescind,89 though Congress has accepted the right of a state to ratify an amendment after 
previously voting no.90 During Reconstruction, Congress expressed its disapproval for an 
unqualified right of rescission,91 but a review of that action reveals that many questions were left 
unanswered. Article V precedents from Reconstruction must be taken with a grain of salt due to 
the special constitutional conditions that immediately followed the Civil War,92 but the attempted 
                                                      
88   During the ratification debate on the original Constitution, James Madison told Alexander Hamilton that 
the “Constitution requires an adoption in toto and for ever. It has been so adopted by the other states.” See Jung, 
supra note 8, at 240 (quoting Letter from Alexander Hamilton to James Madison (July 19, 1788), reprinted in 5 THE 
PAPERS OF ALEXANDER HAMILTON 177–78 (H. Syrett ed. 1962). But this statement was in response to Hamilton’s 
question about whether a state could ratify the Constitution conditionally under Article VII and then withdraw if the 
conditions went unmet. See id. Nothing in Madison’s letter speaks to the issue of whether a state can withdraw its 
assent to a constitutional amendment prior to final ratification.  
 
89   During the 1920s, Congress considered but did not propose an amendment to Article Five that would have, 
among other things, expressly permitted a state to rescind its ratifications of a proposal. See KYVIG, supra note 3, at 
251–53.   
 
90   Some ex-Confederate States initially rejected the Fourteenth Amendment but then decided to ratify and 
were counted in the final tally. See Coleman, 307 U.S. at 448 (observing that Georgia, North Carolina, and South 
Carolina rejected the proposal in 1866 but voted to ratify in 1868). The ratification of the Constitution itself also 
supports the proposition that a state can give its consent after formally refusing. In 1788, Rhode Island rejected the 
Constitutional Convention’s proposal in a referendum, see PAULINE MAIER, RATIFICATION: THE PEOPLE DEBATE 
THE CONSTITUTION, 1787–1788, at 223–24 (2010), but two years later the state convened a ratifying convention and 
reversed that decision. See id. at 458–59.  
    
91   See Coleman, 307 U.S. at 449–50. Senator Charles Sumner argued that a state could not withdraw its 
ratification of an amendment by analogy to a state’s lack of a right to secede from the Union, see CONG. GLOBE, 
40th Cong., 2d Sess. 1142, 1145 (1868) (statement of Sen. Sumner), but these situations can be easily distinguished. 
 
92   See GERARD N. MAGLIOCCA, AMERICAN FOUNDING SON: JOHN BINGHAM AND THE INVENTION OF THE 
FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT 109–11 (2013). For example, senators and representatives of the ex-Confederate States 
were excluded from the portion of the Thirty-Ninth Congress that proposed the Fourteenth Amendment. Likewise, 
Congress imposed upon those states the requirement that they ratify the Fourteenth Amendment as a condition for 
readmission. For an overview of these events, see id. at 109–11, 129–30.

only concrete examples and because they were discussed in Coleman.93  
  The first states that sought to retract ratification votes did so for the Fourteenth 
Amendment. Ohio and New Jersey ratified the proposal early on, but Democratic victories in the 
1867 elections led the new state legislatures in both states to rescind their ratifications.94 By July 
1868, three-fourths of the states had ratified the Fourteenth Amendment if Ohio or New Jersey 
was counted as a yes.95 The Secretary of State, the official then tasked with formally recognizing 
the ratification of an Article V proposal,96 issued a proclamation stating that the status of the 
Fourteenth Amendment was unclear due to “doubt and uncertainty” about the two rescinding 
state resolutions.97 Congress responded with a concurrent resolution declaring the Fourteenth 
Amendment part of the Constitution and listing Ohio and New Jersey among the ratifying

106(b) (2018). In theory, the Archivist could decide on his own that the ERA was ratified rather than deferring to 
Congress. See id. In practice, this sort of action would be a disaster. First, it is far from clear that the statute gives 
any discretion to the Archivist. Second, the Archivist is typically a librarian or a historian who is not expected to 
make legal decisions, especially of this magnitude. Third, if the Archivist acted on his own, then judicial review 
would probably be available to challenge his determination, which would not be the case if Congress concluded that 
the ERA was ratified.

 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3201320 states.98 Unfortunately, Congress did not explain this decision in the resolution or in the brief 
floor debate that preceded approval.99 
Congress’s silent decision to reject the state rescissions leaves open the possibility that 
some right to rescind exists. There is no way to know if Congress intended to lay down a broad 
rule against state rescissions or one that was tailored to the specific circumstances of the 
Fourteenth Amendment (for example, its perceived necessity as a settlement of the Civil War).100 
In Coleman, the Court explained only that “the political departments of the Government dealt 
with the effect both of previous rejection and of attempted withdrawal and determined that both 
were ineffectual in the presence of an actual ratification.”101 And “[t]his decision by the political 
departments of the Government as to the validity of the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment 
has been accepted.”102 Coleman concluded:  
We think that in accordance with this historic precedent the question of the efficacy 
of  ratifications  by  state  legislatures,  in  the  light  of  previous  rejection  or  attempted 
withdrawal,  should  be  regarded  as  a  political  question  pertaining  to  the  political 
                                                      
98   Id. at 710; see Coleman, 303 U.S. at 449. The rescission issue was actually moot. Before the concurrent 
resolution was passed, Georgia ratified and gave the Fourteenth Amendment the three-fourths total without Ohio 
and New Jersey. Paulsen, supra note 11, at 710–11. Though the House of Representatives was informed of 
Georgia’s action via telegram, the Speaker expressed doubt that this constituted a formal notice of ratification and 
thus Georgia’s vote was not recorded. CONG. GLOBE, 40th Cong., 2d Sess. 4296 (1868) (statement of Speaker 
Colfax) (“The Chair doubts whether this is an official notice such as is required. It should be sent by mail.”) When 
the Secretary of State issued his final proclamation on the Fourteenth Amendment one week later, he counted 
Georgia, Ohio, and New Jersey as votes for ratification. 15 Stat. at 710–11; Coleman, 303 U.S. at 449.    
 
99   See 15 Stat. at 710; CONG. GLOBE, 40th Cong., 2d Sess. 4296. 
 
100   The only other state rescission prior to the ERA came when New York repealed its ratification of the 
proposed Fifteenth Amendment. See Coleman, 307 U.S. at 449 n.25; KYVIG, supra note 3, at 182. In this case, 
though, Congress made no statement about the rescission. Instead, the Secretary of State issued a proclamation 
declaring the Fifteenth Amendment part of the Constitution and counting New York as a yes vote. 16 Stat. 1131 
(1870). The Fifteenth Amendment had more than the three-fourths vote required without New York, so the issue 
was moot. See Coleman, 307 U.S. at 449 n.25.

the promulgation of the adoption of the amendment.103     
 
  One aspect of the Fourteenth Amendment precedent that does not receive sufficient 
attention is that Congress rejected the rescissions by a greater than two-thirds vote. In the House 
of Representatives, the vote on the part of the resolution that counted Ohio and New Jersey as 
votes for ratification was 127 to 33.104 In the Senate, the concurrent resolution was adopted 
without objection, which was tantamount to a unanimous vote.105 Nobody contended that a 
supermajority was required to reject a state rescission, but the results were consistent with that 
voting rule.106 And, as I shall explain in a moment, there are sound practical reasons for 
Congress to read its Reconstruction precedent as requiring a supermajority margin.107    
B.  The Special ERA Rescission Problem  
  Setting aside this limited authority, why should a state be unable to change its mind on 
ratifying an Article V amendment from yes to no?108 The best answer is that finality is important 
in the Article V process. If a state can rescind, then there would be no reliable count of the floor 
of state ratifications. A state could also rescind its ratification once three-fourths of the states 
ratify, which in the ERA’s case could throw the question of final ratification into confusion if the 
ratification waiver debate is underway. Or perhaps the thought is that states will just take their

106   See generally id. at 4296 (finding no discussion of supermajority in the House debate record).  
 
107   See infra text accompanying notes 112–15. 
 
108   One textual argument is that Article V refers only to state ratifications, not rejections. See Held, Herndon & 
Stager, supra note 5, at 131–32. Thus, a state can ratify an amendment after a rejection, but not the opposite. Id. This 
argument, however, begs the question of what ratification means. Is a state ratification final or can that be reversed 
under state law? 
 
  22 
 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3201320 decision to ratify more seriously if a yes vote is final.109 Finality is, of course, an important 
consideration in many legal contexts even if imposing finality works an injustice (for example, 
statutes of limitation). To say, though, that finality should preclude rather than just caution a state 
from rescinding a vote for ratification is a difficult proposition to maintain.  
  A categorical argument against state rescission is especially hard to make for the ERA 
because finality cannot be essential for state ratifications yet dispensable for the ratification 
deadline.110 If there were no ratification deadline for the ERA, as there was none for the 
Fourteenth Amendment, then a congressional decision to reject state rescissions for finality 
reasons would be defensible.111 In this instance, though, by waiving the ratification deadline, 
Congress would be denying that finality is a decisive factor. To do so while simultaneously 
declaring that finality precludes a state from rescinding a ratifying vote would be inconsistent 
and cast a shadow on the ERA’s legitimacy. No convincing distinction exists between how 
finality should operate with respect to Congress and state legislatures, who are co-equal partners 
in the Article V process.112 More importantly, even if a distinction could be cobbled together, 
many people may dismiss the claim as result-driven or partisan.  
  South Dakota’s rescission of its ERA ratification demonstrates a related finality 
argument. Unlike the other four rescinding states, South Dakota did so in protest of Congress 
                                                      
109 See id. at 133. I should note that there is no allegation, other than the Kentucky example discussed earlier, see 
supra note 7, that the rescinding states used an invalid procedure at the state level.  
 
110 See Held, Herndon & Stager, supra note 5, at 117 (noting Congress’s extension of the ratification deadline for the 
ERA). 
 
111 Id. at 123 (“The first time limit imposed on the ratification of a constitutional amendment was in . . . the 
Eighteenth Amendment . . . .”) 
 
112 See Paulsen, supra note 11, at 731 (“Within broad bounds, then, a state should be free to determine, as a matter of 
its own law, the procedures governing its own legislative processes . . . and this freedom should extend to 
amendment ratification issues.”). 
  23 
 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3201320 extending the ratification deadline without any clear recognition that the states could rescind.113 
The South Dakota resolution stated, in pertinent part:  
[I]f the Congress of the United States ex post facto can unilaterally alter the terms 
and conditions under which a proposed amendment to the Constitution of the 
United States is submitted to the several states for ratification, in the absence of a 
clear determination  of the ability  of a state  legislature to rescind a previous 
ratification, the effect will be to inhibit state legislatures from acting promptly on 
any  proposed  amendment  for  fear  of  transferring  the  power  to  amend  the 
Constitution of the United States to a small minority of the several states, and, 
perhaps, even a small minority of several generations . . . .114  
 
Likewise, the state resolution stated:  
[T]he opinion that the Congress of the United States ex post facto has the power to 
unilaterally  alter  the  terms  and  conditions  under  which  it  submits  proposed 
amendments to the Constitution of the United States would necessarily inhibit 
debate on the merits of the proposed amendments and force each legislature to 
consider the probability and  timing  of the possible ratification  of  other state 
legislatures because of the uncertainty caused by the perpetual possibility of a 
sudden change in the Constitution of the United States due to a shift of opinion in 
a small number of states . . . .115  
 
South Dakota did not contend that Congress lacked the power to alter the ratification deadline 
and disregard any state rescissions. The point was just that doing both was simply unfair.    
  Another way of explaining the same idea is that Article V can tolerate only so much 
procedural creativity. A decision by Congress to ignore the state rescissions and waive the 
expired deadline would leave opponents of the ERA feeling cheated to an extent that would not 
be true if only one or the other was done.116 Many Americans would be convinced that the ERA 
was not “really” part of the Constitution. Some states and private parties might respond by

could be judges who would respond by giving the narrowest possible reading to the ERA given 
its dubious status.118 Others will just ignore what they deem to be a phony constitutional 
amendment.119 None of this is good for the rule of law. 
  Even more disturbing is the possibility that another Congress might try to repeal the 
“illegitimate” recognition of the ERA. The finality interest is at its apex for the official 
acknowledgment that an amendment is part of the Constitution. Declaring that a provision is 
included in our higher law and then retracting that decision would be highly disruptive. 
Nevertheless, if Congress can by joint resolution declare the ERA ratified, then why can that 
decision not be repealed by a joint resolution? Finality does not provide as strong an answer as 
possible given that the amendment can be ratified only by rejecting finality for the ratification 
deadline. Moreover, the ERA states that its provisions do not take effect until two years after 
ratification.120 As a result, an attempted congressional repeal during that transitional period 
(basically, by the next Congress) would arguably not disturb any reliance interests that finality 
ordinarily protects.121

118   See Denning & Vile, supra note 12, at 598–600. Denning and Vile claim that the Twenty-Seventh

argument. 
 
119   Id. 
 
120   See supra text accompanying note 1. 
 
121   Another lurking issue is that a state could attempt to rescind its ratification after three-fourths have ratified, 
but before Congress waives the deadline. My view is that a state can do this until Congress acts. After Congress 
recognizes the ERA as part of the Constitution, though, a state could not rescind and undo the ERA. 
 
  25 
 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3201320    The best way to avoid these tough hypotheticals and extended disputes is to craft a final 
recognition process that can satisfy the ERA’s supporters and opponents. The best idea would be 
for Congress to wait until thirty-eight states other than the rescinding states ratify before taking 
up the issue of waiving the ERA’s ratification deadline. The other thought would be to insist—
consistent with the Fourteenth Amendment precedent—that the rescissions may be disregarded 
only by more than a two-thirds vote in each House.122 Neither choice is stable, as one Congress 
cannot bind another on these topics, but either one is superior to holding that Congress should 
disregard the state rescissions and can do so with a majority in each House. 
  Given that Coleman concluded that state rescissions raise a political question, Congress 
can choose to tacitly acknowledge the ERA rescissions. This would mean that six more states, 
not one more, would be required to ratify the proposal for the total to reach thirty-eight. No 
action would be required—Congress could just ignore any petitions to waive the ratification 
deadline until six more states act. In this sense, there need be no formal recognition of the right 
to rescind. If and when thirty-eight non-rescinding states ratify, then Congress could just say in 
waiving the deadline that three-fourths of the states have ratified the ERA without listing the 
individual states and thus rendering a judgment on the validity of the five rescissions.123 Or 
Congress could choose at that time to accept or reject the rescissions. Either way, one cloud over 
the legitimacy of the ERA would be completely erased. 
  In the event that Congress exercises its authority to disregard the rescissions, then the 
next-best solution would be for Congress to use a two-thirds voting requirement for that action. 
                                                      
122   See Coleman v. Miller, 307 U.S. 443, 449–50 (1939). 
 
123   Granted, the Fourteenth Amendment resolution did list the states that were counted as voting for 
ratification. See supra text accompanying note 97. But it is hard to see why this sort of catalog is required when 
there is a consensus that thirty-eight have ratified.  
 
  26 
 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3201320 Such a rule would be in accord with the way that Congress addressed the issue in 1868.124 
Furthermore, imposing a supermajority threshold on rejecting the rescissions would go a long 
way toward persuading skeptics that the ERA was not being rammed through Congress on a 
partisan basis or in a way that ignores states’ rights. Meanwhile, critics of accepting (tacitly or 
not) a right to rescind will be able to reject the five state withdrawals in a fashion that does not 
clash with the past practice of Congress. This compromise will not please everyone. But consider 
that using a supermajority procedure for the waiver of the ratification deadline would contradict 
past practice (the extension of the ERA in 1978 by a majority).125 The best way to introduce a 
reassuring safeguard into the ERA’s recognition process is at the rescission stage.126 
  In sum, the presence of state rescissions muddies the water on whether Congress should 
waive the ERA ratification deadline. To avoid a sharp blow to the ERA’s legitimacy, Congress 
should tread carefully before deciding to reject the rescissions in the name of finality in addition 
to waiving the ERA’s “final” ratification deadline.   
PART IV—WHEN THE BALL IS IN CONGRESS’S COURT 
  This Part looks at what Congress might consider in assessing if the ERA ratification 
deadline ought to be waived if three-fourths of the states ratify. Part of the answer clearly turns 
                                                      
124   See supra text accompanying notes 97–103. There is a coordination problem here, in that neither House of 
Congress can dictate the rules of the other. See U.S. CONST. art. I, § 5. The Senate and the House of Representatives 
would have to agree on the text of a joint resolution that expressly contained a supermajority standard, or the 
leadership in both parties would have to reach an informal understanding that the resolution would not be brought up 
in one body if the other did not vote by at least two-thirds in favor.  
 
125   See supra text accompanying notes 74–75. A Senate filibuster of a joint resolution waiving the deadline 
would create a modest supermajority barrier, but the Senate can decide that the ERA resolution may not be 
filibustered.   
 
126   In practice, insisting on a supermajority for rescission would probably mean that a supermajority would 
exist for waiving the ratification deadline (unless, of course, no action is taken on the ERA until thirty-eight non-
rescinding states ratify). A Representative or a Senator who votes for rejecting the state rescissions is unlikely to 
turn around and vote against waiving the ERA’s ratification deadline. 
 
  27 
 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3201320 on the views of individual members and their constituents about the merits of the amendment. It 
is a fool’s errand to predict what those attitudes might be at some unknown date, 127 so I will 
explore three other points. One is what the ERA would do if ratified. The substance of a 
proposed constitutional amendment cannot be completely divorced from the ratification process, 
especially in a doubtful case such as this. A second “X factor” is the degree to which originalism 
gains additional ground in the constitutional culture, which may make the ERA appear or be 
more necessary. Finally, I shall address whether Congress would, in essence, conclude that the 
ERA’s expiration deadline should be treated as final due to stare decisis or reliance interests.     
A.  What Would the ERA Accomplish?  
  Canny politicians will probably think hard about what the ERA may mean—and what 
they may be blamed for—before they decide whether to waive the ratification deadline. This 
question poses a challenge because when ratification is under consideration, the law of sex 
equality will be very different from where the doctrine was in 1972 when the ERA was proposed 
and may be very different from where the law is now. The recent ratification debates in Nevada 
and Illinois, though, shed some light on what ERA supporters believe the proposal will do. 
One recurring theme is that the ERA should be ratified mainly for symbolic reasons. 
Justice Ginsburg said in 2014 that she wanted the ERA in the Constitution partly because “I 
would like my granddaughters, when they pick up the Constitution, to see that notion – that 
women and men are persons of equal stature – I’d like them to see that is a basic principle of our 
society.”128 Some legislators in Nevada also urged ratification on symbolic grounds. For 
                                                      
127   Consider, for example, how events such as the confirmation of Justice Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court 
can change public opinion on gender issues.

May 30, 2018) (statement of Rep. Welch) (quoting Justice Ginsburg on this point). 
 
  28 
 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3201320 instance, one Assemblywoman said that “[t]his resolution is symbolic and not in a bad way.”129 
Another explained her support by noting: 
[T]his Chamber is full of symbolism. On my left hand I wear a ring that symbolizes 
my promise to love, respect, and stay faithful to one man for the rest of my life. We 
stand underneath a seal that reminds us we are a Battle Born State and that Home 
Means Nevada, and we pledge allegiance to a flag every single day to celebrate the 
freedom that was so hard fought for.130  
 
The idea that the Constitution is in part aspirational is not a new one, as the Preamble itself 
serves that purpose.   
Another school of thought is that the ERA would force the Supreme Court to apply strict 
scrutiny to sex classifications and accept Congress’s authority to enact more sweeping legislation 
on gender equality. Legislators in Nevada and Illinois both observed that under current doctrine 
intermediate scrutiny is the standard for reviewing gender distinctions.131 These ratifiers argued 
that the ERA would require the federal courts to apply strict scrutiny.132 One senator in Nevada 
argued that, under intermediate scrutiny, “discrimination based on sex can often be validated by 
basing such discrimination on long-held traditions,” which she said would not be the case under 
strict scrutiny.133 An Illinois representative who made a similar claim also argued that the ERA

objection to ratification. See id. at 312–15 (statement of Rep. Morrison). The Illinois Senate ratified the ERA 
without debate.

  29 
 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3201320 would “give Congress a constitutional basis to enact legislation that targets gender violence and 
enhances the protections for victims”134 and thereby overrule United States v. Morrison.135    
A third possible understanding of the ERA’s scope is that the text would codify existing 
Supreme Court doctrine on sex equality, which is neither symbolic nor a change in the prevailing 
legal standard.136 There were some endorsements of this logic in the state ratification debates as 
well. For instance, two Illinois Representatives asserted that the ERA was necessary to “prevent 
a rollback” of the court’s precedents.137 One of them pointed to the invalidation of Section Four 
of the Voting Rights Act in Shelby County v. Holder138 as proof for “why we must pass the Equal 
Rights Amendment.”139 In Nevada, a related point made was that “[t]here is a difference between 
relying upon other amendments and legal interpretation of laws by courts, as opposed to ensuring 
a constitutional right to [sex] equality.”140 
By the time Congress takes up the ratification-deadline waiver, the ratification of the 
ERA may be construed as requiring heightened scrutiny for related legal distinctions. Three 
federal circuit courts have held that the word “sex” in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964

 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3201320 should be construed as covering workplace discrimination based on either sexual orientation or 
transgender status.141 These decisions may not survive Supreme Court review, but if they do, 
then does that mean that the ERA’s statement that “equality of rights under the law shall not be 
denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of sex”142 should be 
interpreted to incorporate sexual orientation and transgender people? This was not how the 
proposed amendment was understood by its supporters in 1972, but there could be a different 
view if and when three-fourths of the states ratify. 
The takeaway is that many members of Congress may make their decision on waiving the 
ratification deadline based on what they think the ERA is. In other words, if this Twenty-Eighth 
Amendment is seen as symbolic or as a codification of existing precedent on sex discrimination, 
then one would expect greater support in Congress.143 The ERA would then look more like the 
Twenty-Seventh Amendment, which was very narrow in scope and hence something that was 
deemed acceptable for ratification even though more than two centuries had elapsed since its 
proposal. If, on the other hand, the ERA is understood as making more sweeping changes to 
existing doctrine, then the fairness concerns about waiving the ratification deadline will loom 
larger, either in reality or as an excuse for those who do not support those changes.  
An additional wrinkle is that the unique circumstances surrounding the ERA’s final 
ratification provide Congress with an opportunity to make its views known on which of these 
                                                      
141   See, e.g., Equal Opportunity Employment Comm'n v. R.G. & G.R. Harris Funeral Homes, Inc., 884 F.3d 
560, 571 (6th Cir. 2018) (transgender identity); Zarda v. Altitude Express, Inc., 883 F.3d 100, 108 (2d Cir. 2018) (en 
banc) (sexual orientation); Hively v. Ivy Tech Cmty. Coll. of Ind., 853 F.3d 339, 340–41 (7th Cir. 2017) (en banc) 
(sexual orientation).    
  
142   See source cited supra note 1 and accompanying text. 
 
143   The opposite view is possible. A member of Congress might conclude that waiving the ratification deadline 
is warranted only if the ERA will make a substantial change in the law. I am not convinced that most people will 
take that position.  
 
  31 
 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3201320 various interpretations is best. A joint resolution waiving the ratification deadline could state the 
understanding upon which Congress made its decision. While there is no precedent for Congress 
to offer substantive comments on the meaning of an Article V amendment at the formal 
recognition stage, there is no obvious reason why Congress could not do so when the recognition 
choice is complicated. What persuasive authority that sort of congressional statement would have 
in the courts is unclear. But a qualification or clarification of the ERA’s meaning may persuade 
skeptical members to support a ratification deadline waiver.      
B.  Originalism and Ratification 
  Another external force that may influence Congress in assessing whether to waive the 
ratification deadline is how the ERA relates to the authority of originalism in constitutional 
interpretation. There is a symbiotic relationship between the ERA and the constitutional zeitgeitz 
within the Supreme Court with respect to originalism. They thrive together and suffer together, 
and at the moment both are on the upswing.  
The weakness of originalism when the ERA was under consideration in the 1970s 
hindered ratification. Opponents of the ERA argued that the amendment was not needed because 
of the Supreme Court’s recent “living constitutionalism” decisions applying Fourteenth 
Amendment heightened scrutiny to sex classifications.144 If the Court had adhered to an 
originalist view of the Equal Protection Clause that excluded women from heightened scrutiny, 
then the ERA may well have been ratified to satisfy the popular hunger for constitutional sex 
equality.145 An Article V amendment, of course, is one way of changing the Constitution when 
                                                      
144   See Siegel, supra note 24, at 1403–06. 
 
145   On this score, one critical discussion came from Justice Powell’s concurrence in Frontiero v. Richardson. 
See Frontiero v. Richardson, 411 U.S. 677, 692 (1973) (Powell, J., concurring). In contrast to Justice Brennan’s 
plurality opinion, holding that sex distinctions should receive strict scrutiny, id. at 688 (plurality opinion), Justice 
Powell wrote, “[b]y acting prematurely and unnecessarily, as I view it, the Court has assumed a decisional 
responsibility at the very time when state legislatures, functioning within the traditional democratic process, are 
  32 
 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3201320 the Court will not. Originalism, however, did not command the support within the Court in the 
1970s that developed in subsequent decades.146   
The return of the ERA at a moment when originalism is more prominent is probably not a 
coincidence. Stare decisis may well lead even a dedicated originalist to affirm the Court’s equal 
protection decisions on sex equality. But voters could be concerned that these decisions are at 
risk without an explicit textual grounding in the Constitution. In 2011, Justice Antonin Scalia 
explained in an interview: “Certainly the Constitution does not require discrimination on the 
basis of sex. The only issue is whether it prohibits it. It doesn’t. Nobody ever thought that that’s 
what it meant. Nobody ever voted for that.”147 In the Illinois House, one proponent of ratifying 
the ERA quoted Justice Scalia’s comment for the view that women were not protected by the 
“Constitution as written.”148 Even if the argument that a more originalist Supreme Court will 
lead to a rollback of the sex equality cases is nothing more than fear-mongering, this does mean 
that such rhetoric will be ineffective in getting the ERA ratified.149    
  Some originalists might also find ratification of the ERA useful because it would reduce 
the Court’s reliance on common-law methods of constitutional interpretation. If heightened 
scrutiny for sex distinctions (and maybe sexual orientation or transgender discrimination) rested 
                                                      
debating the proposed Amendment.” Id. at 692 (Powell, J., concurring). “It seems to me,” Powell added, “that this 
reaching out to pre-empt by judicial action a major political decision which is currently in process of resolution does 
not reflect appropriate respect for duly prescribed legislative processes.” Id.  
 
146   See, e.g., District of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U.S. 570 (2008) (using an originalist method to hold that the 
Second Amendment guarantees an individual right to own a handgun to protect the home).

  33 
 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3201320 on text that was more specific than the Equal Protection Clause, then those doctrines could be 
examples of rather than exceptions to originalism.150 Furthermore, a successful use of the Article 
V process is consistent with a broader theme of originalism that the proper method of broad 
constitutional change is through a constitutional amendment rather than by judicial decision.151 
One challenge for that point is that no Article V amendment (save the unusual Twenty-Seventh) 
has been ratified in nearly fifty years. Without a successful recent example, the claim that an 
amendment is the only valid approach will ring hollow and be a weak spot for originalism.152 
C.  Stare Decisis and Reliance 
  A final consideration for Congress is whether there is something unjust about changing a 
ratification deadline that was widely relied upon decades ago. Though Congress has the authority 
to change the deadline, that does not mean that doing so is right. Even if finality is insufficient to 
justify denying a state a limited right to rescind its ratification of an Article V amendment, that 
does not mean that finality deserves no respect. How should this interest be taken into account? 
  The best premise for that analysis is that Article V, as Professor John Harrison said, 
“seeks to capture, in a bottle made of legal form, the lightning of American popular 
sovereignty.”153 As a result, the procedures used to implement Article V must serve some 
purpose consistent with the goal of reflecting popular sovereignty. With respect to the ERA, the 
                                                      
150   Another way of putting this is that the ratification of the ERA might undermine the authority of other non-
originalist cases. This prospect might raise concerns among potential supporters of the ERA, but that will depend 
somewhat on why they want the amendment ratified.  
 
151   See, e.g., John O. McGinnis & Michael B. Rappaport, Our Supermajoritarian Constitution, 80 TEX. L. 
REV. 703, 802–03 (2002). 
 
152   I cannot predict what path originalism will take between now and whenever Congress might be asked to 
address the waiver of the ERA ratification deadline, so the thoughts outlined in the text may not end up being 
important to the outcome.

  34 
 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3201320 best argument for not waiving the ratification deadline is that all but two of the states that ratified 
the ERA did so in the 1970s. Counting those states towards the three-fourths total (even when 
recognizing the right of one of them to rescind) could therefore be a backwards-looking take on 
the will of the people. For instance, some states that ratified the amendment at that time are now 
more conservative politically (such as West Virginia, Wyoming, North Dakota, or Montana) and 
might not ratify the ERA today. 
  One response to this point is that asking Congress to wait until thirty-eight states ratify 
without the five rescinding states, as Part III argued, would alleviate this concern by compelling 
six more states to ratify the ERA. This would mean that a significant slice of contemporary 
public opinion would have to support ratification actively for the Twenty-Eighth Amendment to 
become law. In the alternative, if Congress decided to ignore the rescissions by a greater than 
two-thirds vote, that would indicate (albeit in another form) that there was a wave of support for 
ratification in the present. In this sense, if Congress exercises restraint on the rescission question, 
then that can confer legitimacy on its decision to waive the ratification deadline in accord with 
the underlying popular sovereignty principle of Article V. Granted, the reasoning just expressed 
is not conclusive. Just because six states ratify between today and whenever Congress decides to 
take up the ratification issue does not mean that there would be a consensus for the ERA. 
Likewise, a decision by a particular Congress to ignore the rescissions through a supermajority 
vote could be the product of a single election that was highly favorable to one party and cannot 
be said to reflect the durable consensus that Article Five demands. Ultimately, Congress must 
gauge the public mood (as members regularly do) and try to assess whether wide and deep 
support exists for the ERA once the formalities stated in Article Five (rather than the timeline in 
the amendment’s joint resolution) are satisfied. If that is the case, then the expiration of the 
  35 
 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3201320 ratification deadline need not stand in the way of the ERA’s recognition as part of the 
Constitution.154  
  In sum, Congress must take many issues into account if and when they decide whether 
the ERA ratification deadline should be waived. The scope of the amendment, the status of 
originalism, and the weight due to the reliance interest on the expired deadline will be three of 
the issues for lawmakers and the electorate to consider.155 
 
CONCLUSION 
  Constitutional law is often more about what officials should do rather than what they can 
do. The possible ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment is a prime example. While this 
Article argued that Congress possesses the authority to waive the ERA’s expired ratification 
deadline and disregard the state rescissions on ratification, doing both would be misguided. 
Changes to the nation’s higher law must command a consensus to be legitimate. Generating that 
consensus requires respect for the formalities of Article Five and active consultation with the 
public. “Pulling a fast one” is not a phrase that should be associated with the ERA. 
  Accordingly, the watchword is patience. Congress should wait until six more states ratify 
the ERA before considering a deadline waiver. Failing that, Congress should follow the 
precedent set by the Fourteenth Amendment and hold that only a greater than two-thirds vote in 
the Senate and in the House of Representatives can count the five rescinding states as votes for 
                                                      
154   One last point worth considering is whether waiving the deadline would have adverse implications beyond 
the ERA. The answer is no, because no other constitutional amendment proposed by Congress but not ratified 
contains a ratification deadline in its joint resolution. The only impact that an ERA waiver would have for the 
Article V process is that Congress may insist in future on placing ratification deadlines into the text of the proposed 
amendment.       
 
155   It is possible to imagine a general election campaign run in part of the issue of whether Congress should 
ratify the ERA, which would give the public another chance to render its verdict, but that scenario may not 
materialize.

should join the Constitution be answered.
