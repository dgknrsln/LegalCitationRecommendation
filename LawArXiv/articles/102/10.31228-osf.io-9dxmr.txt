SOCIOCULTURAL CONTEXT 
David G. Epstein* 
Under the leadership of Dean Blake Morant,1 the Wake Forest 
Law Review (the “Law Review”) presented a symposium: Contracts 
in Context: Identity, Power and Contractual Justice.  Robert Samuel, 
the Executive Forum Editor of the Law Review, has asked me to 
write a short scholarly2 response3 to one of the papers presented at 
the symposium and later published in the Law Review, Reasonable 
Expectations in Sociocultural Context (the “Article”)4 by Professor 
Nancy S. Kim.5 
The Article starts6 (and ends)7 with the premise that contract 
law should enforce the reasonable expectations of the parties.  This 
is a hard premise to challenge.8  And an even harder premise to

  2.  In responding to Robert’s kind invitation, I told him that, unlike Dean 
Morant, Professor Kim, and the other Symposium participants, I am not a 
contracts scholar; I just teach contract law to law students and law school 
graduates studying for the bar exam.  Nonetheless, I have written this short 
response, which I hope is “scholarly” enough, because like everyone involved in 
higher education (only more so), I am indebted to the late Tom Hearn, President  
of Wake Forest University for twenty-two meaningful years.

rejoinder showing how I misunderstood her article.

The  Article  recognizes  the  two  problems  with  applying  this 
premise:  (1)  how  does  a  court  decide  what  expectations  are 
“reasonable,”10 and (2) what does a court do when the contracting 
parties have different reasonable expectations.11  The Article then 
uses two cases to illustrate how “sociocultural dissonance between a 
judge and contracting party”12 exacerbates these problems. 
There must be a lot of “sociocultural dissonance between a judge 
and  a  contracting  party”  who  appears  before  her  in  terms  of 
education, income, and social status.13  I am just not sure that there 
are  a  lot  of  cases  in  which  that  matters—at  least  not  a  lot  of 
reported  cases.    For  instance,  Leonard  v.  Pepsico,  Inc.14—the 
example  of  such  sociocultural  dissonance  most  familiar  to  law 
students15—arose  from  a  Pepsi  promotional  campaign  in  which 
“Pepsi  Points”  could  be  redeemed  for  various  prizes.    Justin 
Leonard, a twenty-one-year-old member of the “Pepsi Generation” to 
whom Pepsi intended the commercial to appeal, sees a commercial 
offering a Marine Harrier fighter jet for 7,000,000 Pepsi Points and 
submits an order form to Pepsi. 
After Pepsi responded, “The Harrier jet in the Pepsi commercial 
is  fanciful  and  is  simply  included  to  create  a  humorous  and 
entertaining ad,” Leonard sued for specific performance.16  When 
Pepsi moved for summary judgment, Leonard’s attorney argued that

a federal judge comes from a “narrow segment of the enormously 
broad  American  socio-economic  spectrum,”  and,  thus,  that  the 
question whether the commercial constituted a serious offer must be 
decided by a jury composed of, inter alia, members of the “Pepsi 
Generation,” who are, as plaintiff puts it, “young, open to adventure, 
willing to do the unconventional.”17 
Plaintiff’s argument was essentially that a federal judge would 
view his claim differently than would fellow members of the “Pepsi 
Generation.”18  Judge Kimba Wood19 correctly and deftly laid out 
why  no  reasonable  person  of  any  sociocultural  category  would 
regard the commercial as an offer to deliver a military jet costing 
more than $20,000,000 to any person who provides “Pepsi Points” 
worth $700,000.20 
I.  KIM V. SON 
Kim  v.  Son,21  the  Article’s  first  example  of  sociocultural 
dissonance, involved a personal promise by an owner of business 
entities to a friend that he would use his own funds to repay loans a 
friend  had  made  to  the  promisor’s  business  entities.    Not 
surprisingly,  the  promisemaker  later  became  a  defendant 
promisebreaker.    Not  surprisingly,  both  the  trial  and  the 
intermediate appellate court ruled that the “promise to repay the 
money was entirely gratuitous and unenforceable.”22 
It is easy to argue that the situation in Kim v. Son is one of 
many in which the requirement that a promise be supported by 
consideration  produces  a  result  that  is  inconsistent  with  the 
reasonable  expectations  of  the  parties.23    The  Article,  however, 
makes  the  harder  argument  that  it  was  the  existence  of  the

  19.  Litigators often say that knowing your judge is more important that 
knowing the law.  Even discounting the value of this aphorism, before John 
Leonard’s attorney made the tactical decision to argue that a jury, unlike Judge 
Wood, would be “young, open to adventure, willing to do the unconventional,” he 
should have known more facts about Judge Wood—facts such as her being voted 
#1 “Superhottie” of the female federal judiciary and her briefly training to be a 
Playboy bunny before attending Harvard Law School.  See Dave Saltonstall,

2011]  RESPONSE TO REASONABLE EXPECTATIONS  57 
sociocultural dissonance between the parties and the judge, and not 
the existence of the doctrine of consideration, that is to blame for a 
result inconsistent with the reasonable expectations of the parties. 
There  are  three  additional  facts  in  Kim  v.  Son  that  seem 
important  to  the  Article’s  sociocultural-dissonance  argument:  (1) 
both the promisor and the promisee (but not the trial court judge) 
were Koreans; (2) “saving face” is more important to Koreans than 
profit;24 and (3) “saving face” is the reason that the promisor made 
the promise.25  From these facts, the Article concludes that if the 
Court had looked to “the social and cultural value of saving face,”26 it 
would have concluded that the promisor’s relief from shame was a 
“legal benefit.”27 
I  do  not  know  what  the  adjective  “legal”  adds  to  the  word 
“benefit” that is not conclusory.28  I do know the argument that 
moral obligation should count as consideration has been made at 
least  since  the  time  of  Lord  Mansfield.29    And  generally,  this 
argument has been rejected.30  The reasons for the rejection do not 
include sociocultural dissonance. 
Even if the judge in Kim v. Son had the benefit of the various 
references  to  Korean  culture  in  the  Article,  he  still  would  have 
concluded  that,  under  the  American  law  of  consideration,  the 
promise was not enforceable.  Moreover, if the judge in Kim v. Son 
had determined that “relief from shame” was a “legal benefit” for a 
Korean promisor whose shame was “so great,” the judge should have 
also  found  that  relief  from  shame  was  a  “legal  benefit”  for  a 
Westerner with a less acute sense of shame.  A “mere peppercorn’s” 
worth of shame would have been enough.31  Again, the result in Kim

blood and that “both men had consumed a large amount of alcohol.”  Id. at 655.

a way to show sincerity rather than as evidence of extreme intoxication” in 
Korean culture.  Id. at 657.

consideration for a contract, that would practically erode to the vanishing point 
the necessity for finding a consideration.”).

Equity can inforce, and promises, the honesty and the rectitude of the thing is a

consideration.”).  It is not surprising, but regrettable, that both the trial court 
and the intermediate appellate court in Kim v. Son used unnecessary (and 
misleading) adjectives such as “adequate” and “sufficient” before the noun

v. Son is inconsistent with the reasonable expectations of the parties 
because  of  the  elements  of  the  doctrine  of  consideration—not 
because sociocultural dissonance caused the elements of the doctrine 
of consideration to be improperly applied. 
II.  IN RE MARRIAGE OF WITTEN 
The Article also uses the case In re Marriage of Witten32 to 
illustrate  sociocultural  dissonance  between  the  judge  and  a 
contracting party affecting reasonable expectations of a contracting 
party.    Witten  involved  an  “Embryo  Storage  Agreement” 
(“Agreement”)  entered  into  by  Tamera  Witten  (“W”)  and  Tripp 
Witten (“H”), who were married and about to engage in the process 
of in vitro fertilization.  The Agreement provided that W and H’s 
stored embryos could “be used for transfer, release or disposition 
only with the signed approval of both Client Depositors.”33 
Then,  the  Wittens  divorced.    In  the  divorce  proceedings,  W 
asked for “custody” of the embryos.  H did not consent.  The trial 
court ruled that the dispute over the embryos should be governed by 
the  Agreement,  which  required  both  parties’  consent  to  any 
disposition of the embryos.  Accordingly, W did not gain custody of 
the embryos.34  The Iowa Supreme Court reached the same result, 
taking  a  very  different  approach:  “judicial  enforcement  of  an 
agreement  between  a  couple  regarding  their  future  family  and 
reproductive  choices  would  be  against  the  public  policy35  of  this 
state.”36  In other words—which happily are the words of the Iowa 
Supreme Court—“we reject the contractual approach.”37  The court 
then decided that, in the absence of a controlling agreement, the 
“better  principle  to  apply,  we  think,  is  the  requirement  of 
contemporaneous  mutual  consent.”38    Again,  this  was  not  a 
contractual approach39—the court found that the Agreement was not 
enforceable under these facts. 
And again, as in the Article’s first-principal case, we see another 
court’s applying a contract law doctrine—unenforceability by reason 
 
“consideration.”  See David G. Epstein & Yvette Joy Liebesman, Bearded Ladies 
Walking on the Brooklyn Bridge, 59 ARK. L. REV. 267, 304 n.192 (2006).

disputes as following either: (1) a contractual approach, (2) a balancing test, or 
(3)  a  contemporaneous  mutual  consent  model.  The  court  adopted  the  last 
approach. Id. at 774.  
2011]  RESPONSE TO REASONABLE EXPECTATIONS  59 
of  public  policy—that  operates  independently  of  the  reasonable 
expectations of the parties.  Decisions like Witten are based on the 
premise  that  “party  autonomy  is  outweighed  by  some  other 
interest.”40  The cultural dissonance, if any, in Witten is between W 
and the Iowa legislature. 
The Article suggests cultural dissonance in Witten between the 
presiding judge, Judge Marsha Temus, and W.  More specifically, 
the  Article  posits  that  a  woman  such  as  Judge  Temus  was  not 
“impervious to the male bias prevalent in society”41 and so failed to 
give  appropriate  consideration  to  factors  such  as  that  “in  vitro 
fertilization is a painful process for the woman [involved]”42 and that  
“the expense and improbability of [(W)] being able to repeat the in 
vitro process.”43 
Other articles have used these and other factors to make the 
argument that public policy should favor the right of the woman, 
who has endured in vitro, to create over the right of the man, who 
merely supplied the sperm, not to procreate.44  The Article suggests 
a different argument for why W should get the embryos: promissory 
estoppel.  Professor Kim wrote: 
Trip made either an express or implied promise to Tamera 
that he would participate in the in vitro process with the goal 
of becoming a parent.  Tamera acted in reliance upon this 
promise  when  she  underwent  the  physically  demanding 
procedure. . . . To  conclude  that  Trip’s  promise  should  be 
enforceable to the extent of the reliance would permit Tamera 
to use the embryos.45 
This assertion is a very creative promissory estoppel argument.  
The  Article  makes  an  even  more  creative  cultural-dissonance 
argument.    Recall  that  the  court  directly  refused  to  enforce  an 
express agreement about later use of embryos because of a public 
policy  to  respect  “the  right  of  individuals  to  make  family  and 
reproductive decisions based on their current views and values.”46  
And, that public policy came from statutes and case law.47

Assume,  as  the  Article  argues,  that  there  was  cultural 
dissonance between the judge and W.  And assume, as the Article 
suggests, that had there not been any cultural dissonance between 
the  judge  and  W,  the  court  would  have  recognized  “an  implied 
contract between Tamera and Trip whereby each promised the other 
to do their part to have biological children.”48  The same public 
policies based on statutes and court decisions that respect “the right 
of individuals to make family and reproductive decisions based on 
their current views and values”49 should be as applicable to implied 
agreements as they are to express agreements. 
As  with  cases  involving  agreements  that  are  unenforceable 
because of the absence of consideration, cases involving agreements 
that are unenforceable because of public policy can be used to argue 
that contract law does not always enforce and protect the reasonable 
expectations of the parties.  The argument that such cases—or at 
least  the  two  cases  in  the  Article—show  that  sociocultural 
dissonance between the parties and the judge causes decisions that 
do not reflect the reasonable expectations of the parties is, in the 
jargon law professors use, problematic.50
