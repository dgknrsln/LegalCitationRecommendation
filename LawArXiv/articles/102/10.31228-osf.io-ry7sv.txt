1. INTRODUCTION
TheInformationAgehasledtoanexponentialincreaseindatacollectionfrombothprivate
companies and government agencies. Thanks to the ubiquitous inter-connectivity brought
by the Internet, user data is now easily captured, collected, and stored in massive data
centers for its preciousness in automatic knowledge discovery and applications of pattern
recognition in the marketing realm. Consequently, the storage centers keep growing as
data is always stored by default, and not forgotten. Looking at the last few years, this has
caused personal data to be too vulnerable to security breaches like the notorious incidents
atYahoo,1 Equifax,2 eBay,3 Adobe,4 andCambridgeAnalytica.5
Despite being conscious that modern technology enables for unprecedented forms of
data matching, de-anonymization, and mining, users are often unaware of what sorts of
operations their data goes through, nor do they have control over how it is used. In addi-
tion,mostserviceprovidersusevagueandinaccessibletermsintheirsoftwareagreements,
which results in another opaque wall for the average user of their products, consequently
contributing to the creation of extensive digital dossiers.6 While many observers in the
U.S. used to perceive digital redemption as entirely unworkable and ridiculous, after the
Snowdenrevelations,thegeneralpublichasbeguntoconsidertheideamoreseriously.7

Incentivized by these and additional issues, in 2016, the European Union adopted the
General Data Protection Regulations (G.D.P.R.)8 - a massively complex law aimed at reg-
ulating data protection and privacy for E.U. citizens, as well as personal data export by
service providers outside the European Economic Area. In Article 17, this new law in-
troduces the Right to Erasure, more commonly referred to as the Right to Be Forgotten,
as a basic and universal right for all data subjects9. It asserts that data subjects have the
right to request the removal of their personal data from any data controller without undue
delay.10 The law speciﬁes cases when this right is applicable, including when the personal
data is no longer necessary for the purposes for which it was collected and when the data
subject revokes their consent. If the personal data has been publicized, the regulations
require the data controller11 to “take reasonable steps, including technical measures, to in-
form controllers which are processing the personal data that the data subject has requested
theerasure[...] ofanylinksto,orcopyorreplicationof,thosepersonaldata”.12

Individuals whose personally identiﬁable information is still present and discoverable by
online services in the context of unﬂattering events, such as arrests or public scandals,
could be subject to ostracism and discrimination from employers or creditors. In these
cases, the Right to Be Forgotten allows them to request the online erasure of their past,

2. BACKGROUND ON G.D.P.R.
European lawmakers and courts have a long history of protecting privacy. In 1995, at the
time when Internet was still at infancy, the European Council issued the Data Protection
Directive13 “ontheprotectionofindividualswithregardtotheprocessingofpersonaldata
and on the free movement of such data”, which was superseded, in 2016, by a more com-
prehensivereformcalled theGeneralDataProtectionRegulation (G.D.P.R.),whichenlists
provisions that are better suited for the modern technologies and the recent data usage

trends in the online world. Today, the G.D.P.R. is regarded as a gold standard for privacy
protectionlawsaroundtheworldinthesetimesofatechnologicalrevolution.14
TheG.D.P.R.deﬁnestheterm‘personaldata’as“anyinformationrelatingtoanidenti-
ﬁedoridentiﬁablenaturalperson(‘datasubject’);anidentiﬁablenaturalpersonisonewho
can be identiﬁed, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identiﬁer such as a
name,anidentiﬁcationnumber,locationdata,anonlineidentiﬁerortooneormorefactors
speciﬁc to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social iden-
tity of that natural person”.15 However, Viviane Reding, Vice-President of the European
CommissionandEUCommissionerforJustice,proposedaslightlymodiﬁeddeﬁnitionfor
the type of data that the G.D.P.R. should protect. She stated that if we limit the notion of
datatothe“informationthattheconsumershavevoluntarilygivenouttotheonlineservice
providers”,thenitiseasiertorequirecontrollerstomanagethereferencesinmediaorany-
where else, while respecting the state-speciﬁc laws for the freedom of expression.16 This
deﬁnition of data falls under the ﬁrst category, according to the data type classiﬁcation of
chief privacy counsel of Google, Peter Fleischer, who thinks that this makes space for a
“legallyenforceablerightthatismostlysymbolicandentirelyunobjectionable”.17
Amongalongoflistofrequirementsandprovisions,theG.D.P.R.introducestheRight
to Data Portability, the Right to Not Be Proﬁled and the Right to Be Forgotten, which
empower online users with the ability to have full control over giving and withdrawing
consent on how their personal data is used and requesting erasure of its online presence.
The Right to Data Portability maintains that data subjects have the right to receive all
the personal data concerning them in a structured and portable format that can easily be

transmitted to other data controllers.18 On the other hand, data subjects have the Right to
Not Be Proﬁled, which means that, unless explicit consent is given, the users shall not be
subject to any form of automated processing of personal data to analyze or predict aspects
concerning their performance at work, economic situation, health, personal preferences,
interests, reliability, behavior, location or movements.19 Thirdly, the most interesting and
controversial20 provision of the G.D.P.R. is the Right to Erasure (Right to Be Forgotten),

abled by the data collection of individuals without their full knowledge, and the regulation
ofthepersonalresultsdisplayedbysearchengines.
This right, however, only pertains to the protection of personal data, as deﬁned above,
and is applicable on a best effort standard for data controllers23. In addition, the G.D.P.R.
gives data controllers the ability to refuse the user’s request for the erasure of personal

Beginning 25 May 2018, the G.D.P.R. is enforceable - directly binding and applicable
- upon all the online service providers that which are based in the E.U. or whose users are
citizensoftheE.U.. ThismeansthatdatacollectingandprocessingcompaniesintheU.S.,
such as Google or Facebook, will also need to comply to this regulation if they operate in
theE.U.,hence,forthbrininganelaboratediscussiononwhethertheU.S.shouldadoptthis

3. THE CENTRAL DEBATE IN THE U.S.
The Right to Be Forgotten is only applicable in cases when personal data is previously
madepubliclyavailable,hencedifferingfromthemoregeneralRighttoPrivacy,asalluded
by Warren and Brandeis,25 and exercisable for private data under the logical extension of
the Fourth Amendment to digital properties. However, the Right to Be Forgotten does
contradict the right to express one’s opinions without restraint, as outlined in the First
AmendmentoftheBillofRights. Therefore,intheU.S.,anyrequestmadeunderthisright
couldbeinterpretedasanattempttocensorship,henceviolatingthefreedomofexpression.
Hitherto attempts by judges, legislators, and advocates to etch out some space for privacy
concernsinthelightofthereverenceforexpression,explicitlygrantedintheConstitution,
havebeenwoefullyunsuccessful.26
Moreover, there is an inherent dimension of time in any claims to exercise the Right to
BeForgotten. TheG.D.P.R.recognizesthatthepassageoftimeisoneofthemainfactorsin
judgingthe necessityforthe continuationof dataprocessingby thecontroller.27 However,

Given that the introduction of this right primarily affects the press, journalistic orga-
nizations have also participated in this discussion, with the New York Times warning that
suchapowerfulrightcouldimpedejournalistsanddissidentsfromgettingtheirvoiceheard
andthis“purge”willeventuallyleavethepubliclesswellinformed.28
Furthermore, The Economist takes the discussion beyond the aspect of civil liberties
whentheyidentifytheenormousburdenofcomplianceforsmallcompanies,which,inthis
current state of technology where A.I.-enhanced software is primarily data-driven, “would
keep technology companies from innovating”.29 Though, the very idea that the current
technological trends of innovation are profoundly dependent on the collection of personal
datacouldbethecoreproblemthattheG.D.P.R.isaddressing.
Ontheotherhand,theargumentsfromthepartiesadvocatingtheRighttoBeForgotten
mainlyconsistinthatpermanentstorageofallsortsofpersonalinformationmaybesubject
to a large-scale data cross-referencing that could fuel up abusive, biased, and discrimina-
tory software classiﬁcation systems, subsequently contributing to the establishment of an
Orwellianstructure. SupportersoftheRighttoBeForgottenevenincludeprestigiousjour-
nals in Europe, which have applauded the European Commission’s decision to arbitrate an

“avictoryovertheomnipotenceofAmericanInternetcompaniesandavictoryofthevalue
placedbythepeopleoftheOldWorldagainsttheeconomizationoftheprivatesphere”.31
Nonetheless, the general opinion in the U.S. remains strongly negative towards the
import of the Right to Be Forgotten. Andrew McLaughlin, former head of global public
policy for Google and deputy chief technology ofﬁcer for the Obama Administration, has
calledthis“anepicallybaddecision,atravesty,anexampleofgreatmoralandinstitutional
failure on the part of the European Union itself”. He asserts that the suppression of true
information, that is not libel or meant as hate speech, will only favor the interests of well-
connected elites in Europe, who have a particularly strong concern in hiding embarrassing
factsabouttheirlives.32
Onasimilarnote,JonathanZittrain,professorofInternationalLawandComputerSci-
ence at Harvard University, insists that the Right to Be Forgotten is a bad solution to a
real problem since “the incentives are clearly lopsided towards content removal” without
oversightorpenaltyprovisionsforimproperremovals,whichwilleasilyleadcompaniesto
fulﬁll takedown requests without much selectivity, consequently decreasing the quality of
contentontheInternet.33

ject.34 In addition, Section 107 of the DMCA35 permits the use of copyrighted material in
situationsthatareconsideredfairuse,includingcriticism,comment,newsreporting,teach-
ing, scholarship, or research, hence rendering the IP and copyright mechanisms unsuitable
forcaseswhenthepersonaldatathatisexposedonthewebdoesnothaveanartisticnature
orisusedfairly.
Secondly, another legal mechanism that can be utilized to control the ﬂow of personal
information online is that of contractual obligations, such as Non-Disclosure Agreements.
However, the restrictions only apply to persons privy of the contract, whereas much of the
onlineinformationaboutthedatasubjectsoccuroutsideofthatrelationship.
Thirdly, subjects wishing to have their personal data removed can follow the avenue of
defamationclaimswhentheinformationdamagestheirreputation. Unfortunately,informa-
tion genuineness is an absolute defense in these cases and, in many instances, courts have
maintainedthatpublicinterestandnewsworthinessarenotnecessarilydiminishedwiththe
passageoftime.36
Finally, the privacy torts (intrusion upon seclusion, public disclosure of private facts,
misappropriation, and false light37), despite being relevant to digital redemption, are usu-
ally successful in obstructing the distribution or access to information only if it is in the
interest of the public, and not on an individual level, where the damages occur from con-
tinuedaccesstopersonalinformation.38
Even though there is no U.S. law that can provide the same beneﬁts as the G.D.P.R.’s
Right to Be Forgotten, there exist multiple privacy-protecting regulations that work in dif-
ferent contexts, such as the Fair Credit Reporting Act of 1970,39 the California Consumer

ThelackofaU.S.legalframeworkthatisequivalenttotheG.D.P.R.inthecontextofthe
Right to Be Forgotten does not suggest, however, that U.S. legislators have not considered
or attempted to import this right. Speciﬁcally, the New York Assembly Bill 532343 and
Senatebill456144wereintroducedinFebruary2017byAssemblymanDavidI.Weprinand
State Sen. Tony Avella with the purpose of rectifying an individual’s reputation that was
wrongly diminished through inaccurate information found on the Internet by mandating
that:
Upon the request from an individual, all search engines, indexers, publishers
andanyotherpersonsorentitiesthatmakeavailable,onorthroughtheinternet

protections and ensure that the Internet remains an engine for innovation and economic
growth.47 The outlined framework introduces protections over what personal data organi-
zations collect from data subjects and how they use it by requiring collectors to provide
transparency, respect for the context, secure data handling, focused collection, and ac-
countability.48 This proposal has not moved forward since it would not give the F.T.C.
the authority to enforce the principles, instead, make companies and industry associations
write their own rules and then ask the F.T.C. to sign off on them, potentially overturning

Melvin v. Reid In 1931, the appellate court in Melvin v. Reid, held that the use of
the real name of a prostitute in the movie “The Red Kimono”, depicting her murder trial
in 1918, was “unnecessary” and harmful, since it had caused her ridicule and exposed her
to obloquy, hence upholding the plaintiff’s claim that it violated her right to privacy. The
court’smainargumentreliedonthefactthat“oneofthemajorobjectivesofsocietyasitis
now constituted, and of the administration of our penal system, is the rehabilitation of the
fallenandthereformationofthecriminal”.50

Briscoe v. Readers Digest Association Later on, in 1971, the California Supreme
Court in the case of Briscoe v. Readers Digest Association, decided that the exposure of
a criminal who paid their debt to the society and started a new, law-abiding life, without
sufﬁcient reason connected to the current events of public interest, constituted an invasion
oftheirprivacy.53
Throughout the years, the attitudes in case-speciﬁc decisions have changed sometimes
in favor of the Right to Erasure and mostly not. In fact, Melvin v. Reid and Briscoe v.
Readers Digest Association are two of the very few cases when these sorts of claims have
won over the freedom of expression. Therefore, it is not quite right to argue that there has
been a gradual tendency towards one end of the rope in this tug of war. However, it was
not until the landmark case of Google Spain v. AEPD in 2014 when the discussion around
truthfulcontentremovalfrompublishedsourceswasthoughtofthroughthelensofaRight

4.1. GoogleSpainv. AEPDandMarioCostejaGonza´lez
The history of the Right to Be Forgotten in the E.U. starts with a decision of the Euro-
pean Court of Justice for the case of Google Spain v. the Spanish Data Protection Agency
(A.E.P.D.) and Mario Costeja Gonza´lez. On the order of the Spanish Ministry of Labour
and Social Affairs, a Spanish newspaper called La Vanguardia published two announce-
ments regarding the forced sale of Costeja’s properties arising from his social security

debts. Arguing that the sale had been closed a long time ago and that it carried no fur-
ther relevance, Costeja asked Google Spain to remove links to the announcement of the
newspaperappearingfromaGooglesearchofhisname.54
Eventually, the court ruled that an individual may request links to be removed from
the search engine’s index search and that engines are processors of personal data and, as
such, are responsible for taking the necessary steps to hide the digital footprint of the data
in concern. In addition, the court ruled that the information in question must be obso-
lete, seriously harmful, and belonging to a person with no public relevance or historical
signiﬁcance.55
Inthismonumentalcase,weseetheﬁrstattemptatdeﬁningthescopeofaccountability

lishers, because the impact on personal privacy of journalistic media articles is lower than
theimpactcausedbytherevelationofuniversalresultsaffordedbyasearchengine,which
makesitpossibletobuildupacompleteproﬁleoftheaffectedindividual.56
If this case were to be carried out in the U.S., Costeja’s claims would most probably
beunsuccessfulbecauseofFirstAmendment’sinterpretedpriorityandGoogle’simmunity
from liability as a search platform as described in Section 230 of the Communications

whether the online service providers should proactively take the necessary measures to
track the ﬂow of personal data, record the intermediate conduits in the process, and take
the necessary measures to be able to execute an erasure request swiftly and fully; or, al-
ternatively, take a more reactive approach by evaluating and operating on a case-by-case
basis. While the former is ideal for the end-users, it would introduce an enormous imple-
mentation barrier for businesses since it demands a big infrastructural upgrade that incurs
massive costs. In addition, this would result in a bigger collection of meta-data, which
partlycontradictstheessenceofexercisingtheRighttoBeForgotten.
Secondly,itisuncleartowhatextentdatachanneloperatorsshouldbeheldaccountable
fortheerasureprocedures. TheG.D.P.R.doesnotexplicitlyenlistwhattypeoftheprovided
serviceswouldqualifythecontrollersasresponsiblefortakingthenecessarystepstofulﬁll
an erasure request. The deﬁnition of the protected personal data in Article 17 implies that
the direct publisher will be responsible for the erasure, however, it is ambiguous whether
that extends to the providers of third-party references to the publishing authority (i.e. the
sharing of a link or the the whole content of personal data within the service platform,
outsidetheplatformthroughtheutilitiesofthepublisher,oroutsideoftheplatformthrough
otherutilitiesprovidedbyexternalapplicationsoroperatingsystems).
In addition, there is no predeﬁned erasure strategy that clariﬁes whether the critical
content should be permanently removed, stored in a dormant server and hidden from pub-
lic access, or just hidden from “na¨ıve” users’ access but still reachable through speciﬁc,
detailed,andexplicitsearchqueriesorsimilaroperations.
Moreover, with an increasing number of modern hardware and software tools that ex-
tend the capabilities of the traditional data-mining algorithms, a new set of methods of
re-identiﬁcation and de-anonymization are being invented.58 Therefore, it appears that

G.D.P.R. and cited in Section 2 of this paper, is not enough to hide the identity of individ-

their identity by utilizing these re-identiﬁcation algorithms that work on publicly available
informationorauxiliarydata. Consequently,thisburdenstheDataProtectionOfﬁcerswith
unreasonable liability and responsibility for being aware of all the contemporary methods
of maliciously restoring the hidden identity of the protected data subjects, and continu-
ously taking measures to provide up-to-date protection of the personal data in a climate of
fast-paced technological advances and scientiﬁc research on Big Data. Unfortunately, this
onerous duty for the controllers might render the current legal framework for data erasure
to be simply a half measure for what should be a complete and effective, but currently
unfeasible,personaldataprotectionframework.

6. PROPOSED SOLUTIONS
In her speech about data protection in the digital age, Commissioner Reding admitted that
“it is clear that the Right to Be Forgotten cannot amount to a right of the total erasure
of history”,59 and, especially in the U.S., that sentiment is strongly intertwined with the
absolutenatureofthefreedomofexpression.
The only way of reconciling these two opposing forces is to rely upon a collection
of measures - computer code, technical design, market forces, government regulations,

norms, and other social regulators - to jointly govern these values, since none of them can
bedeemedasilverbullet.
One of the non-legal alternatives is employing tools like reputation management ser-
vices (e.g. Reputation.com60, Reputation Defender(cid:13)R61, and Integrity Defenders62) which
are a form of PR or brand management for individuals. This alternative to the Right to Be
Forgottenmaintainstherightofthecontentcreators(e.g. journalists)tofreelyexpresstheir
thoughts, while providing reputation repair by oversaturating the online presence of a data
subject with content from a large number of trust-afﬁrming transactions. These services
do not necessarily present more accurate, relevant, or valuable information, but they offer
a way to counterpoise damaging content. However, the truth remains that this “strong-
arming” method is not effective for subjects wishing to have real seclusion, nor does it
offerafeelingofempowermentwithprivacy.

It is evident that a big redesign that accommodates these trade-offs needs a longer dis-
cussion and understanding from all the involved stakeholders, however, there is space for
immediate action for the initiation of a process of increasing awareness and caution on
the side of the users. Seth P. Berman from Harvard Law calls for more accessible soft-
ware use terms and bigger transparency for the end-user operations that the personal data
is processed for. In addition, he advocates the idea that the U.S. government should create
a liability scheme for data privacy, clarifying the accountability of data controllers.64 On
the other hand, content creators, including news reporters at Reporters Without Borders,
encouragemedia’sself-regulationandthestrictadherencetojournalisticethicsthatcanact
as a preventative measure of concealing personal data that is not necessary for the purpose
ofreporting.65
Above all, multiple scholars like danah boyd, Jeffrey Rosen, and Julian Togelius, ex-
perts in socio-technical research, observe that society will adjust to this revolution of tech-
nology that has brought new paradigms of data processing. They claim that people will

7. CONCLUSION
In this paper I gave a brief overview of a new provision of the General Data Protection
Regulation, namely the Right to Be Forgotten, which aims to give online users the ability
to manage their online presence in an era of continuous and massive data collection. This
newprotectionwasgenerallyapplaudedintheEuropeanUnionandisconsideredatriumph
of civil liberties against the ‘evil’, data-hungry American companies. Even though the

United States has historically embraced a culture of ‘going west’ - loosening the shackles
ofthepastandseekinganewplaceofredemptionandre-inventionofoneself-theRightto
Be Forgotten remains controversial in the U.S., with a low probability that the legislators
deviseasimilarlegalframeworkdueitsarguedunconstitutionalitywithrespecttotheFirst
Amendment rights. Quoting on the court ruling of Time Inc. v. Hill, a good summary of
theAmericanattitudetowardsthisrightisthat“Theriskofexposureisanessentialincident
oflifeinasocietywhichplacesaprimaryvalueonfreedomofspeechandofpress”.67
However, even though the U.S. does not have a similar regulation for data controllers,
American companies whose primary business model relies on personal data processing
are required to comply to the G.D.P.R. as long as they serve to E.U. citizens or operate
in the E.U. This has led to a general increase of awareness of the legal and ethical issues
fromboththecustomersandprovidersside,inadditiontoencouragingabiggerdiscussion
of data hygiene, organization, mindfulness, accountability, and risks. Though, the critics
believe that this is not enough, and that “if America continues on today’s path, it will fail
toprotecttheprivacyofitscitizensandlong-termhealthofitsﬁrms”.68
Even though the G.D.P.R. is a very comprehensive set of regulations for data protec-
tion in the E.U., when it comes to the Right to Be Forgotten, there are still a lot of open
challenges that come with the rapid development of technological tools, for which there
is no obvious legal solution that is general enough to work agnostically with any kind of
onlineserviceprovidersandkeepupwithadversarialmethodsthatcouldpotentiallyantag-
onize digital redemption and forgetfulness. However, there exist non-legal solutions that
accommodate both sides of the central debate in the U.S. and ensure a sustainable future
for online users’ seeking data erasure, as well as for service providers wishing to maintain
theirbusinessobjectivesbykeepingtheircustomershappyandappreciated.
