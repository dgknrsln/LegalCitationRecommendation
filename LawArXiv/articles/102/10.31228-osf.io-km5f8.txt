Overlitigating Corporate Fraud: An 
Empirical Examination 
Jessica M.  Erickson* 
ABSTRACT·  CorfJorate  l,au1  leaves  no  stone  unturned  tuhen  it  conies  to 
litigating  corporate fraud.  17ze  legal  syste1n  has  deuel.oped  a  remarkable 
array  of litigation  options-shareholder  de1ivative  suits,  securities  class 
actions,  SEC enforcement actions,  even criminal prosecutions-all ai111ed at 
preventing the  next  corporate scandal.  Scholars  have  long  assu1ned  that 
tlzese different l,awsuits offer different avenues for detening tlze niasterminds 
of c01tJorate fraud--yet  this  assu111ption  has  gone  untested  in  the  legal 
literature.  This  A1ticle  ai1ns  to fill  that  gap  through  lhe first  e1npirical 
exa111ination  of the broader world  of corporate fraud  litigation.  Analyzing 
over  700  la.wsuits,  the  study  reveals  that  tlzese  larusuits  do  not  ta1get 
different types of corp01·ate wrongs.  Instead these larusuits too often target the 
sa1ne  alleged  1nisco11duct,  the  sanze  defendanls,  and  the  sa1ne  corporate 
coffers. 1'he data also de1nonstrate that certai·n types of l,awsuits consistently 
outpe1form  others,  creating  a  litigation  hierarchy  within  corporate  law. 
These  findings  raise  critical  questions  about  traditional  themes  of 
deterrence,  suggesting that 1n01·e 1nay not alruays be better ruhen  it  conzes to 
co111bating corporate fraud.  77ze Article then brings tlzese empirical insights 
to  bea1·  in  devel.oping  a  neru  fra1neruorh  for  nwre  targeted  deterrence  of 
corporate fraud.

INTRODUCTION 
In  the  \\lake  of the  unprecedented  rneltdO\m  in  the financial 1narkets, 
fe\v  \\'Ould  argue  that  the  la\v  should  curtail  available  avenues  to  con1bat 
corporate  fraud.  Scholars and  politicians alike  have  turned  to  legislation 
and litigation-to prevent future financial cataStrophe.' Congress responded 
to  fiscal  duplicity  in  the  mortgage  industry,  for  exarnple,  by  passing 
land1nark legislation that overhauled  regulation of financial institutions and 
made  it  easier  to  sue  credit  rating  agencies.•  T he  federal  government 
similarly reacted  to  the S\\'eeping  fraud  orchestrated  by  Bernie  Madoff by 
giving the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") a \vide array of ne\'' 
tools to bring corporate \vrongdoers to justice.3 \.\'hen it co1nes to con1bating 
corporate fraud, conventional \visdom holds that more is better. 
The reason is si1nple: Corporate  rnanagers,  like  burglars or tax evaders, 
are  less  likely to  engage  in  misconduct if they  knO\V that  this  misconduct 
could expose them to  legal liability. T his deterrent potential has  been used 
to  j ustify  nearly  every  type  of  corporate  Scholars  have  even 
la\vsuit.~ 
defended  oft-criticized  types  of corporate  fraud  la\vsuits,  such  as securities 
class  actions  and  shareholder  derivative  suits,  on  the  ground  that  these 
la\vsuits help deter corporate n1isconduct.:. 
Yet  this  si1nple  story  masks  the  complex  reality  of corporate  fraud 
litigation.  Corporate  la\v  differs  from  cri1ninal  la\v  or  la\v  in  a 
taX 
fundamental \\lay-corporate  la\v  uses  multiple  rneans  to  punish  the  same 
conduct.  Take  the  example  of  Goldman  Sachs  Croup,  Inc.  Last  year,

The  phenomenon  of  parallel  litigation  complicates  this  picture 
considerably.  It is  no longer enough to say that litigation is good because it 
deters  corporate  fraud.  The  focus  must  instead  be  on  \Vhether  and  ho\v 
specific  types of la\vsuits deter corporate fraud, given  the pan<F/Jly  of litigation 
options. When a corporate executive faces the threat ofj ail time in a criminal 
proceeding or the possibility of multi1nillion-dollar sanctions in  a securities 
class  action,  for  example,  \Vhat  additional  deterrence  does  a  shareholder 
derivative suit provide? 
Thus  far,  there  is  little  corporate  la\v  scholarship  addressing  the 
interplay  ben,•een  different  types  of corporate  fraud  la\\ISUits."  Nor  has  it 
examined  the  impact  of these  parallel  la\\ISUits  on  traditional justifications 
for corporate fraud litigation. This Article aims to fill  that gap by presenting 
the  first  empirical  examination  of the  \vorld  of parallel  corporate  fraud 
litigation. The study tracks approximately  lawsuits over a five-year period 
700 
against more than 160 companies accused of corporate rnisconduct. It traces 
all  of  the  litigation  arising  out  of  tl1e  alleged  misconduct,  including 
shareholder  derivative  suits,  securities  class  actions,  enforcement  actions 
filed by the SEC, criminal  investigations, and ERISA class actions. 
Within  this  array of la'"suits,  the study focuses  on one  in  particular 
shareholder derivative  suits-for  t\vo  reasons.  First,  shareholder  derivative 
suits are among the most co1nmon  type  of private corporate  fraud  la,vsuit, 
outnumbering securities class  actions and  many  other  types  of litigation.

Second, shareholder derivative  suits  are  the  most maligned  weapon  in  the 
law's  arsenal  to  fight  corporate  These  points  make 
malfeasance.'~ 
shareholder  derivative  suits  the  ideal  starting  point  in  exa1nining  the 
broader '"orld of corporate fraud litigation. 
From  this  focused  investigation,  three  key findings  emerge.  First,  the 
traditional  roles assigned  to different types  of corporate  litigation have  all 
but disappeared. Scholars have long believed that securities class actions and 
government  enforce1nent  suits  target  fraud,  \Vhile  shareholder  derivative

conventional account, ho,\lever,  different t}1)es of corporate la'"suics  do  not 
target different  types  of corporate  '"rong .  Corporate  litigation  is  instead 
focused on a single  target-fraud. 
Second, corporate  fraud  litigation  rarely occurs in  a single courtroon1. 
Parallel litigation i  the norm not only in the high-profile scandals that grace 
the  front  pages  of the  \¥all  Strert j ournal,  but also  in  the  run-of-the-n1ill 
corporate fraud cases  that never  reach the nc'"spapers. Approxin1ately 95 % 
of the shareholder derivative  uics filed on behalf of public con1panies in thi 
study '"ere accompanied by at least one parallel la\\ISUil.  Approxin1ately 80% 
of the  public  co1npany  suits  '"ere  accon1panied  by  t\\IO  or  more  parallel 
la\\SUi ts. 
1
Third,  not  all  corporate  fraud  litigation  is  created  equal.  The  study 
uncovers a litigation hierarchy in '"hich certain  types of Ja,"suits consiste ntly 
outperform  others.  Governme nt  investigations  rank  at  the  top  of  this 
hierarchy,  dispensing  S\\rift justice  again  t  the  masterminds  of corporate 
fraud.  Securities  class  actions  come  second.  These  la\\ISuics  often  lead  to 
rnultimillion-dollar  settlen1ents  that  nonetheless  lack  a  strong  deterrent 
punch because the funds typically come fro1n  corporate  bank accounts, not 
from  the  indi\ridual \vrongdoers. Shareholder derivative suits  rank a  distant 
third,  often  ending  '"ith  ettle1nents  co1nposed  of  cosrnetic  corporate 
governance reforms that offer little sub tantive  value. The data suggest that 
while  shareholder derivative  suics  are  the  rnost  cornmon  type  of corporate 
fraud  la\\ISuit.  they  are  also  the  least  effective.  In  short,  '"e  111ay  be 
O\'erlitigating corporate fraud. 
This  Article  proceeds  in  three  parts.  Part  I  sets  out  the  design  and 
methodology of the study.  Part  II  presents  the  en1pirical  results,  revealing 
that a single act of corporate fraud often  parks multiple la"•suits  targeting 
the same alleged misconduct, the sa111e defendants, and tl1e sa1ne corporate 
coffers. Part Ill builds on these en1pirical data by presenting a frame"rork for 
more  Largeted  deterrence  of  corporate  fraud,  one  that \rie'''S shareholder 
deri\'ative  suits  '"itl1in  the  larger  landscape  of  litigation.  Corporate  la"' 
scholarship can  no  longer afford  to  vie'"  these  la'"suit.s  in  isolation.  In  the 
end, nothing happens in a vacuurn, not even corporate fraud.

Plaintiffs  can  file  a  wide  array  of  lawsuits  in  the  \vake  of  alleged

Stanford  Securities  Class  Action  Clearinghouse,39  \vhich  tracks  securities 
class actions filed across the country. Fourth, I revie,ved the case filings from 
the underlying derivative suits because t11ese filings often referred to parallel 
litigation.  Fift11,  I  performed  numerous  Internet  searches  to  locate 
additional cases that were  not identified through the above sources. Finally,

included  a \Vide  range of variables,  including the defendants named  in  the 
suits, the types of clai1ns, the relative timing of the suits, and the outco1ne of 
the  suits.  Finally,  I  collected  additional  data  regarding  the  target

Corporate litigation today resembles a gold  rush in which allegations of 
corporate  fraud  lead  to  a  remarkable  array  of different  lav;suits  based  on 
different  legal  theories.  The  analysis  belo'v  begins  \VitJ1  detailed  data 
revealing the  high  incidence of parallel litigation  in corporate  la,v.  I  then 
describe  the  locus of these  lawsuits,  exploring  a  possible  link between  the 
rise  of parallel  litigation  and  the  shift  of corporate  litigation  a'vay  from 
Delaware.  I finally explore data relating to the allegations in  tJ1ese  parallel 
la\vsuits,  den1onstrating  that  tJ1ese  lawsuits  all  turn  on  the  same  core 
allegation-fraud. 
Incidence of Parallel Litigation 
1. 
The  incidence of parallel litigation  in  the study was  staggering.  early 
95 % of the shareholder derivative suits filed on behalf of public companies 
in the study \Vere accompanied by at least one parallel la\vsuit or government 
investigation.  More  than  80% of the  public company de1ivative  suits \Vere 
acco1npanied  by  or  more  parallel  la,vsuits  or  govern1nent 
t\''0 
investigations.49  Overall,  the public companies examined faced a  median of 
four different types of litigation.5<> 
The  table belo'v sets out the  number of different types of la,vsuits and 
governn1ent investigations faced by the public companies in the study.:.• 
48.  Overall.  76.8%  of the  deri,'ative  suits  in  t11e  study were  filed  on  behalf of public 
con1panies. As discussed below in  Pan Ill.A, t11c private co1npany suits look 1narkedly different 
fro1n their public company counterparts. 
49.  Specifically,  80.2%  of  t11e  public  company  derivative  Sltits  in  niy  sainplc  were 
accompanied by two or more parallel types of litigation, such as a parallel securities class action, 
state  derivative  suit,  ERISA  action,  or SEC  investigation.  I  did  not  include  in  this  figure 
shareholder derivative suits  that were  acco1npanied,  for example, only by  two securities class 
actions or by two ERISA class actions filed in different courts.

Types of Parallel Litigation 
Indeed,  this  diagram  may  not fully  capture  the gold  rush  of litigation 
that follo\vS  revelations of corporate fraud. In most cases, shareholders filed 
multiple la,vsuits of a gi,ven  type. For example, nearly t\vo-thirds of the public 
co1npany derivative suits involved more than one federal derivative suit, and 
more than one-quarter involved four or more federal derivative suits.  More 
than half of the federal  derivative suits  in  the study 'vere accompanied by a 
parallel  derivative  suit  filed  in  state  court.  Similarly,  a1nong  the  suits 
acco1npanied  by  a  parallel  secu1-ities  class  action,  approximately  t\vo-thirds 
involved  four  or 1nore  class  actions. These  constituent cases  were  typically 
consolidated  in  a  single  proceeding,  but  they  reflect  the  rush  to  the 
courtroom that typifies corporate fraud litigation. 
To  u-anslate  these  data  into  current  events,  consider  che  ongoing 
litigation against Comverse Technology,  Inc.  ("Comverse") . For more  than 
ten years,  Comverse executives intentionally backdated the company's stock 
options,  a  scheme  that allO\ved  them  to  circumvent accounting  rules  and 
line  their O\vn  pockets \vith  millions of dollars. When  chis scheme came  co 
light,  Comverse  and  its  executives  v.iere  hit  with  an  array  of litigation, 
including securities class  actions,  shareholder derivative  suits  filed  in  state 66  tOiVA LA iv T?EV/J:;w  [Vol. 97:49 
and federal court, SEC investigations against the company and three former 
senior  executives,  and  cri1ninal  charges  against  several

Comverse's founder and chief executive officer Kobi  Alexander Oed  for the 
African country of Namibia,  \vhere he is currently fighting  His

former colleagues have pied guilty to cri1ninal charges, agreeing  to disgorge 
millions of dollars in lost profilS, and Comverse's former general counsel has 
been  sentenced  to  more  than  a  year  in  jail.11 In  short,  the  alleged 
1 
\\fl"Ongdoers  faced  a  S\veeping  et  of la,,·suilS,  all  arising  out of the  sa1ne 
underlying allegations. 
\\'hat  does  thi  niean  for  corporate  fraud  cholarship?  First  and 
foremost,  it  means  that  this  scholarship  must  reOcct  the  full  panoply  of 
litigation  options. Vie,ving  lawsuilS  in a vacuum leads to  a distorted view  of

These  figures  provide  crucial  insight  into  a  question  that  has  been 
vexing corporate  la'v scholars: Why is corporate litigation  moving away fro1n 
Dela\vare? Conventional \visdom has long held  that Dela\vare  is lhe center of 
corporate la\v, and accordingly many scholars have focused their research on 
Dela,vare  cases.6 Yet  recent scholarship  suggests  that  corporate  litigation 
1 
may  be  leaving  Delaware  in  droves.  According  to  a  recent study  by John 
Arn1our,  Bernard Black, and Brian  Cheffins, as recently as  19  95, over 80% 
of lhe cases filed  against Dela,vare corporations \\•ere filed  in  the Dela,vare 
Court  of  Chancery.68  Over  the  last  fe\v  years,  ho\vever,  this  figure  has 
dropped to less than 25% .li9 
This shift  of litigation  has  not gone  unnoticed  by  the  corporate  bar. 
Theodore  Mirvis,  a  \vell-kno,vn  corporate  defense  Ja,vyer,  claims  that 
plaintiffs'  attorneys  nO\V  use  an  "an)'\vhere  but  Chancery"  approach  in 
selecting a venue for corporate litigation.7° Although Dela\\•are la\v applies to 
most of these disputes regardless  of "'here they are filed,1 many plaintiffs' 
1 
attorneys believe lhey have a better chance of prevailing otnside of Dela\vare 
because non-Dela\vare judges are less likely to  understand the complexity of 
more than one state. 1"hese suits were typically filed in both the stale in which the con1pany was 
headquartered and the state in which the co1npany was incorpora1cd (typically Delaware).

Dela,vare  case  la,v.72  Many  Dela,vare  doctrines  have  long  and  tortured 
histories,  and  Dela,,-are  la'''  is  replete  \vilh  lengthy  opinions  that  turn  on 
complex  corporate  nuances.is  According  to  Mr.  Mirvis,  "trying  to  argue 
Dela,vare fiduciary duty  cases outside of Dela\\"are  i  like  taking Gallatoire's 
secret recipes and  them to a j ack-in-lhe-Box short-order cook.";4 
gh~ng 
As  more and more cases  leave Dela\.vare, courts have started to  suggest 
steps to reverse the trend. In a recent decision that \vas sharply critical of the 
shareholder plaintiffs' bar, Vice Chancellor Laster of the Dela,vare Court of 
Chancery stated  t11at  "if boards of directors and stockholders believe that a 
particular forum  '"ould provide an  efficient and value-promoting  locus for 
dispute  resolution,  then  corporations  are  free  to  respond  ,v-jth  charter 
provisions selecting an exclusive forum for intra-entity disputes.  Although 
";5 
he did not expressly suggest Dela"iare as the ideal forum of choice, one can 
surmise  that  he favors  his  home courts.  Wachtel!,  Lipton,  Rosen &  Katz,  a 
leading corporate defense  firm,  has taken up the charge, recommending to 
its corporate clients that they adopt a charter amendment requiring that t11e 
Dela,vare  Court  of Chancery  be  the  "sole  and  exclusive  forum"  for  any 
breach  of  fiduciary  duty  suit  filed  against  the  company  or  its  officers, 
directors,  or  share holders.;G These  solutions seek  to  halt perceived  fonun 
shopping by plaintiffs' attorneys allegedly anxious to avoid the business-savvy 
and 'vatchfu l eye of the Dela,,'Clre judiciary. 
Yet  perhaps  shareholder  derhiative  suits  are  111oving  to  the  federal 
courts for another reason-the rise  of parallel litigation. As  t11e  data above 
indicate,  a  significant  percentage  of  shareholder  derivative  suits  are 
accompanied  by at  least  one  parallel  la"·suit,  most  co1nmonl) a  securities 
1 
class  action  filed  in  federal  court.  There  is  nothing  surprising  about  a 
derivative plaintiff filing a la,vsuit in  the sarne court as multiple other related 
suits.77  Indeed,  it '"ould  be  n1ore surprising if the  derivative  plaintiff filed 
suit  in  Dela,vare  "'hen  nearly all  of  the other related  litigation  in  the 
\\'aS 
federal courts.is 
Moreover, it often make  ·ense  for these la,vsuits to  be consolidated  in 
the  federal  courts.  Consolidation,  typically  before  a  single  j udge,  aHo" 
significant efficiencies in litigation resources. Only one judge must learn  the 
complex  facts  underlying  the  suits,  and  the  parties  arc  often  able  to

coordinate discovery and other pretrial proceedings. It \VOuld  be impossible 
to obtain such economies of scale in the Dela\vare Court of Chancery or any 
other  state  court  because  most  corporate  fraud  litigation  (other  than 
shareholder  derivative  suits}  arises  under  federal  la'v  and  is  subject  to 
exclusive jurisdiction in the federal courts.i9 Accordingly, the federal courts 
are often the only venue in \Vhich all  related litigation can be heard. 
In  addition,  federal  judges  are  accustomed  to  complex  cases  and 
complicated legal  doctrine. Federal judges in  the Southern District of Ne'v 
York or the Northern District of California may not be steeped in the details 
of Dela,vare corporate  lav;,So  but few \Vould  doubt their ability to get up to 
speed on these doctrines quickly \Vhen  overseeing a state fiduciary duty case. 
Indeed, federal judges sitting in diversity must often learn complex areas of 
state la\v. 
Finally, the attorneys in the study \Vere not filing la\vsuits in jurisdictions 
with  little  connection  to the dispute.  Nearly 95 % of the  federal  derivative 
suits  in this study were filed  in  federal  courts located in  the state in which 
the plaintiff corporation  headquartered. These figures suggest that any 
\\las 
forum shopping is fairly limited.81 
In  sum,  corporate  litigation  may  be  leaving Dela,vare,  but  that  is  not 
necessarily  a  bad  thing.  As  '"e  will  see,  the  rise  of parallel  litigation  also 
challenges tnore fundamental assumptions regarding the types of allegations 
in corporate litigation. 
3.  Allegations in Parallel Litigation 
Scholars have  long presumed that different types  of corporate la\vsuits 
target  different  types  of misconduct.  According  to  this  accepted  'visdom, 
shareholder  derivative  suits  target  traditional  forms  of  corporate 
malfeasance such as self-dealing or usurpation of corporate opportunities,s'

So.  As  I  have  discussed  elsewhere,  nearly  half of shareholder derivath·e  suitS  filed  in 
federal coun are filed in district couns in the Second Circuit or the Ninth Circuit. Sa Erickson,

8 t.  This analysis is  not 1neant to suggest that deri\'3ti\·e plaintiffs do not engage in forum 
shopping. ~1an)• likely do. especially when it comes lo shareholder deri\'3U\'e suits filed  in state 
couns, which arc outside the scope of this study. State coun suits do not benefit from  the same 
economies of scale that arc possible on the federal side, and state court judges may not have the 
experience overseeing large-scale  litigation. Yet  the shift of litigation  into the federal  courts 
suggests that other factors are driving this phenomenon as well. 
82.  Stt,  t.g., Da\is, supra  note 5, al 4 14  (•Today's derivati\°C suit therefore  may function 
mostly as the repository for self-dealing and other duty of lo)'3lt)• claims that neither arise in an

The  parallel  la"·suits  in  thi  stud)',  ho\\'e\•er, challenge  the  notion  that 
corporate  liligation  divides  in  this  manner.  Nearly all  of  lhe  shareholder 
derivative  suits  in  tJ1e  study  turned  on  allegalions  of  corporate  fraud. 
Specifically,  more  tJ1an  90%  included  allegations  of  false  or  misleading

actions in  the United States and Canada,  ERISA  class actions, shareholder 
derivative  suits  in  five  different state  and  federal  courts,  and  an  array  of 
govern1nent investigations.9'' 
These la,vsuits all  turned on one common question: Did AlG managers 
break  the  la'"  by  authorizing  and  then  allegedly  hiding  ics  risky  bets  on 
subprimc  mortgages?  In  the securities  class  action  complaint,  the  plaintiff 
alleged  that  the  defendants  misled  the  market  regarding  the  riskiness  of 
AlG's  investments,  including  "outright  falsehoods"  concerning  AJG's 
internal controls.9' In the shareholder derivative suits, the plaintiffs attacked 
the  invesunents  fro1n  a  slightly  different  angle,  arguing  that  AIG's  top 
managers  consciously  disregarded  the  risks  associated  \vith  these 
investments,  "improperly conceal [ing)  the  true extent of the  exposure"  to 
the risk.!!•  In  the ERISA class action, the plaintiCTs alleged  that the co1npany 
and its executives continued to offer AIG stock as an  investment option for 
employees despite mounting risks  to the company's financial  hcalth.93  The 
FBI  even  launched  a  criminal  investigation  to  determine  \vhether  AIG's 
reckless  invesunents  had  caused  the  company  to  kno\vingly  n1isstate  its 
accounting results.94 
What  does  this  phenon1enon  sa}'  about  the  deterrent  value  of 
shareholder derivative suits? As discussed above, scholars have long justified 
these  suits  on  the  ground  that  they  are  necessary  to  deter  corporate 
managers'  1nisconduct.!I:•  The  modern  reality  of corporate  fraud  litigation 
complicates  this  traditional  rationale.  Given  that  nearly  three-quarters  of 
shareholder  derivative  suits  are  accompanied  by  a  parallel  securities  class 
action,  do  derivative  suits  offer  deterrent  value  that  these  securities  class 
actions  do  not?  Similarly,  \viii  corporate  managers,  who  alrearly  face  the

SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE SUITS AS PARAU £1. lJT/CA T/o,v 
As  the  previous  sect.ion  demonstrates,  corporate  fraud  allegations 
cypically  trigger  a  \vave  of  parallel  la,vsuits.  This  section  explores  this 
interplay  beC\veen  these  la\\'SUits,  focusing  specifically  on  the  role  of 
shareholder derivative  suits  'vithin  the larger landscape of corporate fraud 
litigation.  First,  I examine  the timing of the suits, exploring the possibility 
that  certain  la,vsuits  serve  a  'vhistle-blo,ver  function  by  alerting  other 
potential  litigants  of  corporate  misconduct.  Second,  I  examine  the 
defendants sued  in  the  various  cypes  of suits,  analyzing  'vhether  different 
la\vsuits  target different defendants. Finally,  I compare the outcomes of the 
various suits, examining 'vhether these different outcomes are likely to lead 
to different levels of deterrence. 
Comparing Filing Dates 
1. 
Corporate fraud litigation has long been characterized by a  race  to the 
courthouse, ,vjth  numerous la,vsuits  filed \vithin  \veeks  or even  days  of the 
first  hint of corporate malfeasance.g6 Litigation  can  serve a  'vhistle-blo,ving 
function  by  discovering  this  malfeasance,  and  thus  the  first  attorneys 
through  the  courthouse  doors  may play  a  role  in  uncovering  the  alleged 
fraud or other malfeasance at issue in the later suits. 
Of course,  the  first  filed  la,vsuit  is  not  ahvays  the  most  meritorious. 
Plaintiffs'  attorneys  may  mistake  bad  luck  or poor  market  conditions  for 
fraud,  filing la\\"SUits before gathering concrete evidence of malfeasance. In 
other instances, the cornpany may blo\\• the \\•histJe on its o'vn rnisconduct by 
announcing a  restatement or internal  investigation.!11  Still,  there are  many 
instances  in  \vhich  enterprising  attorneys  take  available  facts  and  piece 
together a  theory of legal  liability.  Con1paring filing  dates  is  therefore  an 
important first step in evaluating the relative merits of these parallel la,vsuits. 
The results of this comparison are striking. Among tJ1e cases examined 
in  this study, the shareholder derivative suits \Vere  co11siste11tl)' filed after both 
the securities class act.ions and SEC enforcement  The shareholder 
actions.9~

97.  The  broad  disclosure  requirements  of  the  federal  securities  laws  often  require 
companies to disclose d1e initial facu rele\-.in110 the alleged \\TOngdoing. 
98.  The six1een  ERJSA suits in  this study did  not follow  this broader pa11en1.  l11ey were 
filed a 1nedian of thirty-six days after the first filed federal deri\'ative sui1, but there were too few 20  OVERJJTIGATING CORPORATE FRAUD

derivative suits 'vere filed after a  parallel securities class action in 82.1 % of 
the  cases,  "rith  federal  derivative suits  filed  a  median  of C\venty-three  days 
after  parallel  securities  class  actions.  Similarly,  the  shareholder  derivative 
suits  in  the  study  \vere  filed  after  the  commencement  of a  parallel  SEC 
investigation in  79% of the cases, \Vilh  the derivative suits filed  a median of 
21.5 days after the commencement of an SEC investigation. T-tests indicate 
that the filing dates of shareholder derivative suits filed in federal courts are 
statistically different  at  the  95 %  confidence  level  from  the  filing  dates  of 
securities class actions and SEC enforcement suits. 
The data also suggest that most corporate fraud litigation is filed 'vithin 
a fairly short \vindo'v of time. This  is especially true in comparing the filing 
dates  of federal  derivative  suits  and  securities  class  actions.  In  this  study, 
65.3% of the  parallel securities class  actions '"ere filed  'vithin sixty days of 
the  federal  derivative  suit.  A  smaller,  but still  notable,  percentage  of the 
other lawsuits  were filed \vithin  this relatively short \vindo\v of time-60.8% 
of the criminal investigations, 48.7% of the SEC investigations, and 56.7% of 
the state coun derivative suits. Figure 3 belo\v illustrates the typical litigation

Figure 3. Timeline of Litigation in the Wake of Corporate Fraud Allegations 
The  data  suggest  that  many  shareholder  derivative  suits  sin1ply 
piggyback  on  securities  class  actions  and  other  types  of corporate  fraud 
la,vsuits. The shareholder derivative suits in  the study rarely acted as '"histle 
blo\vers,  alerting the governrnent and other private plaintiffs of the alleged 
fraud.  Instead,  these  suits  typically  follo,ved  quickly on  the  heels of other

Indeed,  this  Lin1ing  present  the  possibility  that  attorneys  \\•ho  file 
shareholder derivative suits  may \Vatch  for promising  la\v  uits and  then  use 
the allegations in these suits to craft a parallel  hareholder derivative suit. 
Yet,  even  if la\\/Suits  do  not  blo\v  the  \vhistle  on  corporate  fraud,  they 
may still  deter corporate  fraud  by targeting different defendants or ending 
\vilh different sanctions, t'vo possibilities that are discussed belo\v. 
Co1npa1ing Defendants 
2. 
Do  different cypcs  of corporate  fraud  la\vsuits  target different cypes  of 
defendants? Corporate la\v scholarship has long assumed that securities class 
actions  and  govemn1ent  enforcement  actions  target  officers,  \vhile 
shareholder  derivative suits  target directors.11 This assun1ption, ho\vever,  is 
•• 
only  partially  supported  by  tht:  data.  As  the  data  reveal,  rnany  corporate 
officers  arc  targeted  in  a  \vide  array  of la\\'  uits,  not just  secu1ities  class 
actions and SEC actions. Consi ·tent \vlth  the conventional \visdom, ho\vever, 
shareholder  derivative  suits  are  often  the  only  suits  to  target  corporate 
directors. 
Senior  corporate officers are squarely in  the litigation bull's-eye. Table 
3  illustrate  that  chief  executive  officers  ( .. CEOs")  and  chief  financial 
officers  ("CFCs") are typicall)' named in nun1crous parallel la\vsuits.

As  this  table  demonstrates,  CEOs  or  CFOs  at companies  accused  of 
fraud or other misconduct have multiple targets on their backs. 
Moving do\m the organizational chart, ho,vever,  other officers, such as 
corporate vice presidents or deparunent heads,  \Vere  targeted far less often. 
The shareholder  derivative  suits  in  the  study  typically  named  two  officer 
defendants  other  than  the  CEO and  CFO.  Most  commonly,  the  securities 
class  action  named  one  of  these  lo\ver  officers  and  did  not  name  any 
additional officer defendants.  The government used an even  more focused 
approach. The SEC filed  charges against only 25 % of the officer defendants 
named  in  the shareholder derivative  suits,  and  the  DOJ or  other  criminal 
agencies named  only  .4 % of the officer defendants from  the shareholder 
2 1 
derivative suit. •
0
• 
At first glance,  these data suggest that shareholder derivative suits  may 
play a  role  in  deterring  lo\ver-level officers 'vho  are  not targeted  in  other 
litigation.  Interestingly,  ho,vever,  the  federal  government  often  pursued 
charges against officers not narned in the shareholder derivative suit.  Nearly 
half of the SEC enforcen1ent suits against individuals named an  officer \vho 
\\las  not  named  in  the  federal  derivative  suit,  as  did  nearly  40%  of the 
cri1ninal  suits  against  individuals.  These  figures  suggest  that  derivative 
plaintiffs S\veep broadly but 1nay still  miss the key \\•rongdoers in the case.102 
T he  data  regarding  corporate  directors  present a  very  different story. 
The  shareholder  derivative  suits  in  the  study \Vere  often  the  only suits  to 
target outside  directors, or directors who did not also serve in  an  executive 
capacity at  the  corporation.  Nearly  all  of the  shareholder  derivative  suits 
named at least one outside director as a  defendant. These  suits  targeted a 
median  of seven  outside  directors,  a  number  that  reflects  the  fact  that 
derivative  plaintiffs  typically  target  the  entire  board.  As  Table  4 
den1onstrates, outside directors '"ere named far less often in  the other types 
of corporate fraud Ja,vsuits in  the stud}'· 
1o1.  These data focus  solely on govenuncnt enforcement lawsuits filed against individual 
defendants. Data regarding the percentage of SEC i11vestigatio11s targeting corporate officers or 
directors are  not available  because individuals. unlike  public  companies, are not  required to 
disclose the fact that they arc the  of a government investigation. 
sul~ect 
102.  The  govcmrnent  rnay also  have strategic reasons  for going after lower-level officers. 
The governn1ent, for example, rnay  think that these officers will  provide information that the 
governn1ent can use in exchange for rnore lenient treaunent. !OW;\  LA  REVIEW

The  e  findings  suggest  that  the  greatest  potential  for  shareholder 
derivative suits may lie  in deterring outside directors. Ironically, as discussed 
in  Part  III  belo,v,  this  value  is  undercut  by  the  substantive  la\v  in  most 
derivati\'e suits.  reflecting  a  deep  ambivalence  in  corporate  la'v  regarding 
the liability of outside directors. • By the  a1ne  token, shareholder derivative

costs.• These  expected  costs  include  the  penalties and sanctions  that the 
05 
managers \viii  face  if they are caught.100 These penalties accordingly  play  a 
key role in deterring corporate fraud. 
Shareholder derivative suits have  the potential  to shine at this stage of 
the  analysis.  Unlike  other  types  of corporate  fraud  litigation,  shareholder 
derivative  suits  almost exclusively  target  individuals.  In  contrast,  the  other 
types  of la\\•Suits in  the study often  targeted  both individual and corporate 
defendants,  with  the  individuals  rarely  paying  any  money  in  the  final 
settlement. 
The securities class actions in  the study illustrate this  point. More than 
60%  of the  securities  class  actions  settled, • and  these  settlements  '"ere 
07 
sizable, with  a  median value  of $18 1nillion. Yet  the settlement agreements 
typically stated  that the  con1pany \vould  pay  the full  settlement amount.'
0S 
The company \Vas  often  then  reimbursed  for some or all  of the settlen1ent 
amount by the directors' and officers'  ("D&O")  insurance policy.  In either 
instance, the individual defendants rarely had to contribute a penny to settle 
the claims.'09  Moreover, given that corporations pay the premiu1ns for D&O 
insurance,  the  individuals  also  did  not  have  to  \VOn)'  about  increased 
premiums as a result of the settlen1encs. In other \Vords, although individual 
officers  and  directors  are  often  named  in  securities  class  actions, 
corporations  bear  the  brunt  of  the  financial  costs.  As  scholars  have 
recognized,  the  ability  of corporate  1nanagers  co  shift  the  cost  of their

ECONOMICS OF CRIME AND  PUNISHMENT  I  (Gary  Becker &  William  M.  Landes eds. .  1974). 
Many scholars have extended this theory into the corporate realm.  Se.e,  e.f!.,  Miria111  Ii.  Baer, 
Linkage a11d  thl' Dtterre11ce of Corporate Fraud, 94 VA.  L.  R.Ev.  1295,  1302-05  (2008)  (analyzing 
theories of deterrence in corporate law); Coffee, su.pra note 4, at  1p ;56-66  (analyzing Becker's 
theory in the corporate context). 
106.  This fonnulation  is  a  simplistic account  of Becker·s  theory-corporate  wrongdoers 
likely  do  not  engage  in  a  rigorous  cost-benefit  analysis.  and  other  factors  such  as  the 
wrongdoer"s  e\raluation  of  Lhe  risk  rnay  well  impact  1.he  analysis.  These  rcfine111entS  arc 
addressed funher in Part Ill. 
107.  Specifically,  61.7%  of 1.he  securities  class  actions  settled,  26.6%  were  invohnuarily 
dis1nisscd, 2.1 % were voluntarily dismissed. and 9.6% were still pending. None of the securities 
class act.ions in this study went to trial.

little in the \vay of deterrence.''" The  remaining 40% of tJ1e suits ended in a 
settlement,  a  far  lower  percentage  than  in  corporate  litigation  more 
generally. Yet even these settle1nents packed little punch when  it ca1ne  to 
116 
deterring corporate fraud. As I have discussed else\vhere, remarkably fe\v of 
the  settlernents  involved  financial  consideration,  and  even  fe,ver  of  the 
settlements  involved  financial  consideration  that  actually  benefited  the 
plaintiff corporation.
111 
Setting  aside  the  stock  option  suits,  which  are  discussed  below,  only 
3.3%  of shareholder de1ivative  suits  in  the  study involved  a  settle1nent  in 
which  tl1e  plaintiff  corporation  received  1noney  or  another  meaningful 
financial  benefit. The ren1aining settlements in  tl1ese suits \Vere  corporate 
118 
governance  settlements  or  settlements  in  \vhich  the  plaintiff corporation 
agreed to relinquish claims against its officers and directors in exchange for 
reforn1ing  its  O\vn  corporate  governance  practices.  Altl1ough  these 
settlements had the potential to  benefit corporations, the majority included 
only  cosmetic  reforms  that  did  little  to  remedy  tl1e  aJleged  governance 
problems. 
11!1 
Moreover,  shareholder  derivative  suits  are  about  deterrence,  not 
corporate governance reform, and on  this score, the settlements also fall 
120 
short.  A  corporate  officer  or director  who  is  contemplating  engaging  in 
fraud  or  other  misconduct  is  unlikely  to  be  deterred  by  the  threat  of a 
corporate  governance  settlement.  Even  if  the  settlen1ents  included 
meaningful corporate governance reforms, the settlements targeted plaintiff 
corporations,  not the individual  wrongdoers. Officers and directors may be 
required  to  play a  role  in  tl1ese  reforms,  but this  role  is  typically n1inimal, 
such  as  attending  additional  training  sessions  or  1neeting  in  executive 
sessions at board  meetings.  Moreover,  individual  defendants \vho  have  left 
the co1npany are  not i1npacted by tJ1ese  settle1nents at all.  Viewed  through 
the lens of deterrence,  these settlements are  therefore even  less  promising 
than the settlements in other parallel la,vsuits. 
1 15.  A:; I discuss below in Part III, corporate managers n1ay be deterred si1nply by the threat 
of being named in a lawsuit, regardless of its ulti1na1e outcome. 
1 16.  Securities class actions,  for exa1nple,  have  roughly  the opposite ratio of settled and 
dis111issed cases. Studies have found that nearly 60% of securities class actions settle, while 40% 
s,, 
are  dis1nissed  by  the court.  CORNERSTONE  RE.sF.ARCll.  SECURITIES  CLASS  Ac:r10N  fll.INGS:

The stock option suits in  the srudy fared  better.  Unlike  the settlenients 
in the other shareholder derivative suits, the settle1nents in the stock option 
suits  t)'pically  invoh·ed  an  agreen1ent  by  the  officers or directors \vho  had 
receh·ed  backdated stock  options  to  return  the e  options  to  the  company. 
Specifically, defendants in  72.4 % of the stock option settlements agreed to 
reprice  or  forfeit  backdated  options  or  disgorge  any  profits  that  they 
received  as  a  result of the  backdating.  In  short,  the  individual defendants 
had  to  surrender  so1nething-often  stock  options  \VOrth  a  considerable 
an1ount of n1oney-to settle the claims filed against the1n. 
At first glance. tlie  e settle1nents appear to offer meaningful deterrence. 
Even  in  these  cases,  ho,vever,  the  deterrent  value  is  mixed.  Yes,  the 
defendants had to return their ill-gotten gains, but the sanctions \vere ain1ed 
at disgorge1nent rather  than  penalizing  the  individuals.  These  defendants 
only had to return money that they never should have  had in the first  place; 
they did not have  to bear the full cost of their actions.'"' Such disgorgement 
certainly has some deterrent value-people '''ill  not steal money if they knO\V 
they 'viii  have  to  pay it back-but  it al o  mean  that the \vorst that most of 
these  defendants had  to  fear  that  they '''ould  have  to  repay ,,,hat  they 
"~as 
took.  Despite  tl1is  critique,  ho,vever,  there  is  littJe  doubt  that  the  stock 
option  suits  ended  \Vith  far  1nore  meaningful  sanctions  than  the  other 
derivative suits, a point explored further in Part Ill. 
Why do so 1nany shareholder derivative  suits end ''ritl1  \Vorse  outco1nes 
than  other  types  of corporate  fraud  la,vsuits?  The  ans,ver  likely  lies  in  a 
combination  of  t\\'O  factors.  First,  shareholder  de1;vative  suits  are  often 
strangled  b)' a  host of procedural require1nents. 'fhese requiren1ents are all 
ai1ned  preventing frivolou  clcrivative  litigation, but their effect is to 1nake 
al 
it  nearly  in1possible  for  derivative  plaintiffs  LO  present the  merits  of their

Second, 1nany shareholder derivative suits  rnay . irnply serve  as cagalong 
suits to other type  of corporate litigation. The data above suggest tl1at most 
derivative suits today Larget fraud, rather than n1orc traditional forms of self 
dealing. The  rnost con11non  for derivative plaintiffs to challenge alleged 
\vtl)' 
fraud is by alleging that the board of directors breached its duty of oversight 
by failing to prevent the alleged fraud. Courcs  have generally been skeptical 
of these backdoor efforts  to challenge suspected  fraud, largely because fe"'

hard enough to prove fraud in  the first place-it is  harder still  to prove that 
the  board  breached  its  fiduciary  duties  by  failing  to  prevent  the  alleged 
fraud. 
These  observations  provide  a  starting  point  for  future  reform  of 
shareholder  litigation.  Corporate  la\v  scholars  uniformly  agree  that 
shareholder litigation is in need of serious reform.••3 The data above present 
a compelling case that shareholder derivative suits should be an early target 
of any  reform  efforts.  Yet these  efforts  must  take  place  within  the  larger 
landscape  of corporate  fraud  litigation.  Any  refo1ms  that  encourage  the 
filing  of  shareholder  derivative  suits  against  only  the  most  culpable 
individuals  would  likely  result  in  suits  that  simply  duplicate  government 
enforcement efforts. Similarly,  reforms that alto'" corporations, rather than 
individuals,  to  bear  the  bulk  of the  settlement  burden  \vould  encourage 
shareholder derivative suits that are simply tagalong suits  to securities class 
actions and other private litigation. If shareholder derivative suits are to play 
a  meaningful  role  in  deterring  corporate  fraud,  they  must  have  a  role 
beyond duplicating otl1er litigation. In a \VOrld of parallel litigation, the time 
has co1ne for n1ore targeted deterrence of corporate fraud. 
Ill. 
IMPLICATIONS: TOWARD TARGETED DETERRENCE OF CORPORATE FRAUD IN 
SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE LITIGATION 
We  have now seen that allegations of corporate fraud often give rise to 
nu1nerous  parallel  lawsuits.  Outside  the  realrn  of corporate  law,  parallel 
litigation  serves  a  co1npensatory  function-different  la\vsuits  compensate 
different groups of plaintiffs. Corporate fraud la,vsuits,  however, typically do 
not se1ve  a  co1npensatory goal.  Instead,  legal  scholars  have  long agreed 
12
4 
that the chief purpose of these  lawsuits  is  deterrence, 125  a  goal  that makes 
analyzing parallel  la,vsuits  more  complicated. As  appealing as  it may  be  to 
thro\v  ever  1nore  legal  resources at deterring  corporate fraud,  it does  not 
make sense  to have  multiple la,vsuits aimed al the same goal of deterrence. 
Under the current regi1ne,  shareholder derivative suits have  little  marginal 
i1npact  in  deterring corporate  fraud  because  these  suits  so  closely  mirror 
other types  of litigation. This Part presents a  frame,vork for 1nore  targeted 
deterrence  of  corporate  fraud,  exploring  opportunities  for  shareholder 
derivative  suits  to  comple1nent  the  deterrence  efforts  of  other  parallel 
litigation.

The first area '"here shareholder derivative suits can  play a key role i  in 
con1bating  corporate  fraud  and  other  malfeasance  in  private  companies. 
Most  shareholder  derivative  suits  are  filed  on  behalf  of  large,  public 
con1panies,'"6  and  the  findings  in  Part JI  focus  on  these  public  company 
suits.  Yet  23 %  of the  suits  in  the  study  '"ere  filed  on  behalf of private

accompanied by a parallel securities class action, compared to nearly 75 % of 
the public con1pany suits. 
•~9 
These  figures,  ho\vever,  do  not  mean  that  the  players  in  private 
companies are ah\'ays less  litigious.  In 47 .4 % of the suits,  there  at least

contract suits or direct fiduciary duty claims. 
Moreover, the  ettlements that \\'ere pre  entcd to the court appear to be 
far  more  beneficial  to  the  plaintiff corporations  than  the  public company

130.  noted abo\'e, this study may also understate the le\'el of parallel litigation in pri,oate

grievances.·~· 
The  litigation  involving a small  Pennsylvania  company called Circle of 
Friends  ADHC,  Inc.  illustrates  the  promise  of derivative  suits  in  private 
companies. This suit involved a corporate tug-of-\var over Circle of Friends, a 
•3• 
care  center  for  senior  citizens  in  Philadelphia.  According  to  the 
complaint, the defendants stole  money from  Circle  of Friends and  refused 
to pay the plaintiffs  their rightful share of the corporation's profits.'33  The 
defendants vehemently denied  the allegations,  claiming  that  the  plaintiffs 
\Vere  the  ones  \vho  had  stolen  from  the  company.  After  t'vo  years  of 
•:1.1 
heated litigation, the parties agreed to a settlement in 'vhich the corporation

The  case  complicated  and  messy,  but  the  derivative  litigation

ultimately  provided  a  means  for  the  parties  to  exu·icate  themselves  from 
protracted corporate combat. 
It  is  impossible  to dra\v defini tive  conclusions from  Circle  of Friends  or 
the other thirty-seven private company suits in  the dataset. Even  this limited 
dataset,  ho,vever,  suggests  that  private  company suits  have  more  promise 
than  their  public  company  counterparts,  both  in  compensating  plaintiff 
corporations and in deterring future instances of corporate \Vrongdoing. On 
the co1npensatory side, private  company disputes are more  likely to involve 
overt  misconduct-stealing  from  the  company,  usurping  corporate 
opportunities,  entering  into  sham  transactions  \vtth  the  company,  etc.  In 
these  instances,  shareholder derivative  suits  may  be  the  best  'vay  for  the 
companies  to recoup their losses.  Indeed, shareholder derivative suits  \Vere 
traditionally designed  to target this  kind of self-dealing,  not the fraud  and 
other related  claims  that  have  overtaken  public  company  derivative  suits. 
Private company suits are also likely to be less expensive to litigate, tilting the 
cost-benefit analysis in favor of pursuing the suit. 
Shareholder derivative suits may also have greater potential in deterring 
corporate malfeasance in the private company setting. As explained above in 
Part II,  it is  often  quite  easy  for  shareholders in  public  cornpanies  to  turn 
derivative  claims  into  federal  secu1ities  claims  and  vice  versa.  Yet 
shareholders in private companies \vho suspect that a 1najority shareholder is

breached.  A  direct  claim  for  breach  of  fiduciary  duties  requires  the 
shareholder  to  establish  that  it  hurt  in  a  ''ray  distinct  from  the

private  companies,  providing  a  remedy  for  shareholders  \vho  might

UTIC:\ T/0,\1 VACUU1\IS 
In  a  \VOrld  of parallel  litigation,  \vhat  role  do  derivative  suits  play  in 
combating  fraud  or  other  1nisconduct  in  public  companies?  The  (irst 
possibility  lies  in  \Vha1  I  have  termed  "litigation  vacuums"- ituations  in 
\vhich a derivative suit is  the only suit, or one of the onl)• suits, that is filed. 
The concerns raised in  Part II  apply in situations in \Vhich a derivative suit is 
filed  along  \vith  other  la,vsuits,  allo,ving  the  derivative  suit  to  seive  as  a 
tagalong  la\\'Suit  rather  than  a  meaningful  source  of  deterrence  for 
corporate  managers.  Yet  there  are  sicuations  in  \Vhich  the  shareholder 
derivative suit stands alone, and these situations may present an opportunity 
for de1ivative suits to shine. 
As  '"c  sa'"  in  Part  II,  n1ost  shareholder  derivative  suits  target  fraud, 
mirroring  the  allegations  in  other  types  of litigation.  In  theory,  however, 
shareholder  derivative  suits  have  the  potential  to  target  corporate 
'vrongdoing that does not sound in fraud. The classic example is a corporate 
officer  \Vho  usurps a  corporate  opportunity from  the  con1pany.  Corporate 
la\v tnakes clear that such usurpation violates the oflicer's fiduciary duties. •:sS

If the  corporate  opportunity  involved  an  amount  of 1noney  that  \¥as  not 
n1aterial  to  the co1npany or did not involve a  false  or 1nisleading statement 
to the market, the shareholders likely \viii  not be able to  bring a claim under 
the federal securities la\\'S. In  these cases, a  shareholder deriYarive suit may 
be  the  only \vay  to  pursue  legal  redress.'39 The sarne  legal  vacuum  might 
result if a corporation overpays its executives or the board does not exercise 
proper oversight over corporate operations, if these acts are not reflected in 
a false or misleading statement to  the market. In theory, therefore, there is a 
legal  vacuum  in \vhich  derivative  suits stand alone as  the  only legal  option 
for shareholders of public corporations. 
Yet this theory does not match the reality of corporate litigation. As  this 
study demonstrates, any litigation vacuum may be fairly small, at least in  the 
federal courts. Only 5.6% of the public company suits in my sample  (7 out 
of  26 suits) \Vere unacco1npanied by any parallel litigation or investigations. 
i 
The seven stand-alone suits are interesting for one simple reason-none of 
the suits ended \vith  a  meaningful financial settlement for the company.
14° 
Although  these  examples  are  anecdotal  given  their  small  number,  they 
challenge  the  theory  that  the  value  of derivative  suits  lies  in  litigation 
vacuums. 
On  the  other  hand,  the  litigation  vacuum  may  be  larger  than  these 
figures  indicate.  This  study  focused  on  corporate  fraud  litigation  in  the 
federal  courts,  \vhere  parallel  litigation  may  be  1nore  common.'4'  It  is 
possible  that there are  more stand-alone suits in  the state courts. There  is 
little  empirical data on state court derivati,·e suits,'·••  but the data that does 
exist  suggests  that  derivative  suits  filed  in  state  court  may  play  a  111ore 
distinctive role in deterring corporate managers. In  their study of derivative 
suits filed  in  the Delaware Court of Chancery, Randall Thomas and Robert 
Thompson  found  that approxi1nately forty shareholder derivative  suits  are 
filed  per year in  Oela\vare state courts,• 13  a  far smaller number than  in  the 
federal  courts. Yet  almost  half of the  public  co1npany  Dela\vare  suits

139.  Despite  the  ubiquitousness  of such  cases  in  corporate  law  1rcas1ises.  there  were  no 
corporate opponunit)' cases in this stud)' that ended with a 1neani11gful financial benefit. 
140.  Specifically,  three of  the suits  were  involuntarily dis1nissed,  one suit was  \'Oh1n1arily 
disrnissed,  and  the re1naining three suits settled.  None of these se1tle1nentS  ended with  the 
plaintiff corporation recehing a n1eaningful financial benefit. 
141.  As  discussed  above,  the  federal  couns have  exclusive jurisdiction o\·er 1nan)' clairns 
brought under the federal securities la\\'s. Accordingly. one n1igh1 expect shareholder derivaLive 
suits based on the sa1ne allegaLions as parallel securiLies class actions 10 be filed in federc1l coun 
and sLand-alone derivative suits to be liled in sta1e coun. 
142.  There  is  no state  court equivalent  to  PACER, and  tl1ereforc,  state  coun  litigaLion 
research must focus either on a single business court, such as the Delaware Court of Chancery, 
or published decisions available  through  a  co1nmercial database.  as  \\'estlaw  or  Lexis.

•s~ 
packed a  big deterrent punch, both  for the specific individuals \vho agreed 
to contribute  to  the settlement and for other corporate  managers 'vho may 
be contemplating related types of corporate 'vrongdoing. Many of the other

The  stock  option  suits  presented  the  perfect  opportunity  for 
shareholder  derivative  suits  to  shine.  First,  unlike  nearly  all  other 
shareholder derivative  suits, the defendants in  these suits received  niillions 
of dollars  to \Vhich  they \Vere  unequivocally not entitled.  By  contrast,  most 
shareholder  derivative  suits  do  not  involve  claims  that  the  defendants 
personally  benefited  from  their  actions  in  such  a  clear  and  direct  way. 
Second, the  facts  often did  not support claims under  the  federal  securities 
la\v.  Many shareholders  did  file  securities  class  actions  against  companies 
that  backdated  stock  options,  but  these  shareholders  often  could  not 
establish loss causation or other legal  requirements of a fraud  claim.  The 
'3!> 
fiduciary duty claims were a better fit for the underlying facts than causes of 
action that sounded purely in  fraud  because the core problem was  bad aces, 
not bad disclosures. 
In  the  end,  ho,vever,  these  litigation  vacuums  may  be  fe,v  and  far 
bet\veen.  Stock  option  suits  are  a  nearly  unparalleled  example  of  ho\v 
de1ivative suits can shine among the 'vide array of enforcement alternatives.

C.  THE CASE OF CORPORA 'TE OUTSIDERS 
If legal vacuums are an aberration, \vhat role can shareholder derivative 
suits  play  in  the  more  common  situation  in  \vhich  these suits are  filed  in 
concerl \vi th other cypes of corporate fraud litigation? The grealest potential 
for  shareholder  derivative  suits  may  lie  in  their  ability  to  deter  outside 
directors. 
As  explained in Part II, shareholder derivative suits are  the only type of 
corporate  fraud  la\vsuit  that  routinely  targets  outside  directors.  These 
findings  likely  reflecl  strategic  concerns  unique  to  shareholder  derivative 
suits.  Stace  la'" mandales thal shareholders  make  a  presuit demand on lhe 
plaintiff corporation's board unless such a  demand '''ould be  futile.  One 
•.;1 
of the rnost common \vays for a shareholder to plead futility is Lo  allege that 
the  board  itself faces  a  significant risk  of liability  in  the suit and  therefore 
'"ould be  unlikely lo autho1ize  the corporation  to file suil. This procedural 
require1nent  leads  to  plaintiffs'  allomeys  targeting  outside  directors  and 
then clain1ing thal de1nand  is excused because the outside direclors cannot

158.  Additionally. the legal standards in other types of claims n1ake it difficult for securities 
plaintiffs  to  target  outside director.;.  For example,  a  plaintiff seeking 10  pre\'ail  on  a federal

incentives for derivative  plaintiffs to sue outside directors,'59  incentives that 
do not exist in other types of corporate fraud la,vsuits. 
Moreover,  even  \Vhen  outside  directors  are  named  in  these  other 
la,vsuits,  they  almost  never  have  to  make  a  financial  payment,  'vhich 
undercuts the deterrent value of these suits.'00 As  a  nu1nber of studies have 
demonstrated  (including  this  one),  outside  directors  enjoy  a  de  facto 
immunity at the settlement table. This immunity reflects the fact that outside 
directors are typically sued along  corporations, and these corporations 
''~th 
are often \\Tilling to  pay the entire settlement amount to end the litigation. 
Shareholder  derivative  suits  are  different  because  the  corporation  is  the 
plaintiff,  and  therefore  individuals  cannot  hide  behind  a  corporate 
defendant.  By  isolating  from  their  corporate  employers, 
indh~duals 
shareholder derivative suits have the potential to offer greater deterrence. 
Yet shareholder derivative  suits  are not exploiting this opportunity. As 
the  figures  in  Part  II  demonstrate,  outside  directors  rarely  contribute 
financially in  shareholder derivative suits. They may be more  involved 'vith 
the day-to-day litigation decisions, but at the end of the day,  they are rarely 
required  to  make  the  hard  financial  sacrifices  that  lead  to  n1eaningful 
deterrence.  In  short,  there  is  a  gap  between  the  promise  and  payoff of 
derivative suits. 
The  reason  for  this  gap  likely  Lies  in  corporate  la"•'s  ambivalence 
regarding  the  legal  liability  of outside  directors.  Corporate  la'v  maintains 
several  theories  of liability  against  outside  directors,  but  makes  it  nearly 
impossible  for  shareholders  to  hold  outside  directors  liable  under  any of 
these  theories.  This  ambivalence  is  evident  in  the  recent  case  la\v

In  Lhe  decision  of Stone  v.  Ritter,  the  Dela\\iare  Supreme  Court 
2006 
addressed  the  role  of good  faith  in  Dela,vare  corporate  la,v. The  court 
161 
upheld the continued  of tJ1e  duty of good faith,  holding that it ''ras 
\~tality 
part of ilie duty of loyalty.  In  tJ1e  (admittedly small) hierarchy of fiduciary 
•6~ 
duties, ilie duty of loyalty is the 1nost important.16 Corporate managers '"ho 
:1 
violate the duty of loyalty are vie,ved as more deserving of sha1ne  than those 
'"ho  violate  the  duty  of care  or  oilier  legal  obligations.  Standing  alone, 
therefore,  this  part  of the  opinion  reinforced  ilie  need  to  hold  outside 
directors accountable. 
Yet \vhat the Dela,vare Supreme Court gave \vitJ1  one  hand it took a\vay 
'"it11  ilie  ot11er.  The  court  'vent  on  to  emphasize  ilic  steep  hurdles 
shareholders  face  in  attempting  to establish  a  breach  of the  duty  of good

'~olation 
duty  of  good  faitJ1  by  proving  tJ1at  "(a)  the  directors  ullerl)'  failed  to 
imple1nent any reporting or  information syste1n  or controls;  or  (b)  having 
implemented  such  a  system  or  controls,  co11sciously  failed  to  monitor  or

shareholders that the duty of good faith i  "possibly the 1nost difficult tJ1eory

"~n  :, 
Putting  these  t'vo  halves  of the  opinion  together,  the  Dela,vare  Supreme 
Court maintained the possibility of liability for outside directors but 1nade it

The point is not that the Dela,vare Supreme Court should have defined 
the duties of outside directors more broadly. Just because there is  a hole in 
the la\v does not mean that \Ve should rush  to fill  it.  There are good reasons 
for  courts  to  pr.)tect  outside  directors.  A  limited  liability  standard 
encourages  directors  to  take  more  risks  in  the  boardroom,  and  this  risk 
taking generally benefits shareholders.  If outside directors were subject to 
•68 
greater liability,  they \vould  naturally become more risk-averse because they 
\vould  be  bearing more of the  risk  of their decisions \vithout experiencing 
more of the benefits.  AJternatively, outside directors might decide that the 
•69 
risks  outweigh  the  benefits  and  decide  not  to  serve  on corporate  boards. 
Accordingly, it may well  make sense for the courts to enforce only a minimal 
liability standard for directors. 
Yet  the  fact  remains  that  it  is  incredibly  difficult  to  hold  outside 
directors liable for breaching their fiduciary duties. This point highlights the 
irony  of shareholder  derivative  suits.  When  viewed  through  the  lens  of 
parallel  litigation,  shareholder  derivative  suits  appear  poised  to  play  a 
1neaningful  role in  deterring corporate directors, a  role that other types of 
corporate  litigation  do  not  play.  Yet  the  substantive  law  in  shareholder 
derivative  suits undercuts  this deterrence function.  Indeed,  the  substantive 
la'v may reinforce the  idea that derivative  suits  are frivolous.  It is  extremely 
difficult for shareholders  to allege a  viable claim, so  most claims inevitably 
fall short, v;hich in turn bolsters the belief that these suits lack merit. 
Granted, shareholder derivative  suits  may  have  deterrent value even  if 
these suits  do  not result in  meaningful  sanctions. People presumably do 
11° 
not like  to  be sued,  and  they 1nay  refrain  from  violating  the la\V  simply  to 
avoid  the social stigma of being named as a  defendant in  a  la,vsuit  even  if 
they do not fear serious penalties in  the suit.'7'  This may be especially  true 
for high-level  corporate executives, who may  be even more concerned with 
protecting  their reputations. Yet existing scholarship suggests  that any such

possible legal liability for their decisions that they will  take little or no risk or innovative action 
in the boardroo1n. lf directors spend n1ost of their tin1e building paper trails in order to assure

reasons  for  Lhis  deference  to outside  directors as  well.  Se,,  e.g.,  Stephen  M.  Bainbridge,  The

170.  Alternati1ely,  outside  directors  n1ay  not know  the small  likelihood  of being  found 
1
liable for breaching their fiduciary duties.  In ot11er words, deterrence may result not from  t11e 
law  itself,  but fro1n  a misapprehension of the law. See,  e.g.,  Ehud Kamar,  Slrarelrolder Litigation

Directors \\ill not experience  ocial shame if there is a \videspread belief that 
the litigation in question is  frivolous. 1·1 Given  the unimpressive sanctions in 
1
most shareholder derivative suits, many directors may vie'" being named as a 
defendant as a sign of bad luck rather than bad performance. 
This critique highlights the difficulties in  reforming derivative suits. As 
the  pre,rious  t\,·o  sections  demonstrate,  there  are  t\vo  key  areas  in  \Vhich 
shareholder derivative  suits can  add  value  in  a  \\orld  of parallel  litigation. 
1
The first area is  in  litigation  vacuums  in  'vhich shareholder derivative suits 
are a1nong the only suits  that are  filed.  Yet  these vacuums  are  fe,v and  far 
beC\veen,  at  least  in  the  federal  courts.  Moreover,  other than  the  atypical 
exan1ple of stock option suits, n1ost litigation vacuums are not places '"here 
shareholder derivative suits earn their keep. The second  pron1ising area is in 
deterring  corporate directors. Yet  as  \Ve  have just seen,  the substantive  la'" 
\VOrks  hard  to avoid  imposing personal  liability  on outside directors in  all 
but the  most egregious case . 
Perhaps  the  greatest  potentiaJ  for  shareholder  de1ivative  suits  lies 
beyond their lin1ited  ability to  deter corporate '"rongdoing. The discussion 
no"' turns  to chi  final  possibility  in  the search  to find value  in shareholder 
derivative  uits 'vithin the parallel \vorld of corporate fraud litigation.

These instilutions have then attempted to enforce these guidelines through 
voting efforts, shareholder proposals, and other similar campaigns.'"' 
Yet  outsourcing  the  production  of corporate  norms  could  also  dilute 
the  effectiveness  of these  norms.  Board  members,  as  'veil  as  their  legal 
advisors, may listen to the courts more than other social actors. Courts have 
an  i1nprimatur  of legiti1nacy  that  comes  from  being  an  independent yet 
educated observer of corporate disputes.  The judiciary also  has  the threat, 
however 1niniscule, of legal  liability in  those  rare instances in \Vhich  board 
members  blatantly disregard  their duties.  Other institutions  lack  this  rare 
combination of stature and sanction. 
This  combination  of  traits  also  raises  important  questions  about 
institutional  competence.  Should  courts  be  in  the  business of setting  best 
practices  for  the  business  \Vorld?  It  is  one  thing  for  courts  to  establish 
liability standards; it is  quite another for courts to set aspirational standards 
for corporate America. This concern has traditionally been alleviated by the 
fact that Dela,vare courts enjoy a high degree of confidence among business 
leaders  and  corporate  lawyers.  Dela\\rare  has  long  been  kno,vn  for 
appointing judges  'vith  a  canny  business  sense,  and  in  many  instances, 
Delaware courts have proven to be more flexible t11an political institutions in 
responding  to  ever-changing  corporate  governance  demands.  As  more 
211 
litigation  leaves Dela,\lare  for the federal  courts, however, it is i1nportant to 
ask whether other courts are equipped to fill  Delaware's big shoes. Indeed, 
the judiciary's role in setting corporate norms 1nay \veil  recede as corporate 
litigation increasingly moves outside of Dela\vare. 
The final  question  is  the cost of developing these  norms. This Article 
focuses on a comparative analysis of the benefits of corporate fraud litigation. 
Yet  shareholder  derivative  suits  impose  steep  costs  on  the  litigants  and 
judicial system alike, and a final verdict on these suits depends on both costs 
and benefits. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the costs can be substantial. 
In  t11e  derivative  suit  filed  on  behalf  of  Affiliated  Computer  Services 
described above, for exa1nple, the company estimated that its litigation costs

neither co1npen  ale corporations nor deLer  corporate fraud.  The question

CONCLUSION 
Conventional '''isdom  holds that more liLigation is better '"hen it comes 
to  co1nbating  corporate  fraud.  As  this  study  demonstrates,  ho\vever,  this 
,\fi.sdom  does  not  reflect  the  nlodem  reality of  corporate  fraud  litigation. 
The study reveals a '"orld of parallel litigation  in ,,,hich the san1e allegations 
of corporaLe rnisconduct often  lead to different la,vsuits  based on  different 
legal  theories.  The e  finding  raise  critical  questions  abouL  traditional 
theories  of deterrence  in  corporate  la'"·  Scholars  have  long assumed  that 
different  types  of  corporate  litigation  offer different avenues for  deterring 
the 1naster1ninds of corporate  fraud. Yet parallel  corporate  fraud  litigation 
often  targets  the  san1e  underlying  misconduct.  leaving  OLher  conduct 
be)'Ond the la,,,·  reach. 
The  tre1n enclous  upheaval  in  the  financial  markets  gives  rene,,•ed 
importance to efforts to deter corporate fraud. "fhe  time  has come to bring 
these ne'" empirical insights to bear in refor1ning corporate fraud litigation. 
Understanding  the  role  of  parallel  litigation  is  critical  to  these  efforts, 
raising  key  questions  that  have  long  gone  unexplored  in  corporate  la'" 
cholarship. Can \\'e  reform  parallel litigation  to ensure  that different type 
of litigation  '"ork  in  harmony  to  deter  corporate  fraud?  Is  the  current 
panoply of litigation options necessary to achieve optimal deterrence? These 
issues ren1ain for another day, but one thing is clear. The time has come for 
more targeted deterrence of corporate fraud.
