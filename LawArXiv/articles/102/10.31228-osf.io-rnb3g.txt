INTRODUCTION
The problem of inconsistent judgments on the same claim or
issue no longer exists-in theory-thanks mainly to  the law of res
judicata. True, Edward Coke long ago lamented the "contrarieties  of
Ziff Professor of Law, Cornell University. I would like to thank for fruitful
exchanges  Sam Baumgartner,  Zachary Clopton, Stdphanie Francq, Bob Hillman,
Rosalie Jukier,  Jan Kleinheisterkamp,  Jeff Rachlinski,  Stewart  Schwab,  Harumi
Takebe,  Barry  Vasios,  and  the  participants  in  Cornell  Law  School's  summer
faculty workshop.2  THE RE VIEW OF LITIGATION  [Vol. 36:1
verdicts  and judgments one against  the  other."' But if the problem
did still exist, it would be serious.  First,  society now recognizes  an
efficiency  interest  in  avoiding  inconsistent  adjudications.  At  best,
inconsistency would erode faith in our system of justice and diminish
acceptability of its output. At worst, inconsistency would put a party
into  an impossible  situation of conflicting  obligations.  Second,  any
decrease  in  the  certainty  and  stability  of  repose  would  create
inefficiency.  Society has  an interest  in  increasing certainty  for the
purposes of primary conduct; once a court determines legal relations,
we all need to be able to act in the world with assurance  that those
relations are indeed fixed to some known extent.  Society also has an
interest in increasing stability in the judicial system;  we all benefit
when courts treat prior decisions, from the same or other courts, with
respect and comity. Third, fairness further argues for equal treatment
in similar circumstances,  and for furtherance  of reliance  interests by
consistently adhering to prior adjudication.2
One of the obvious  purposes  of our  res judicata  law  is  to
minimize  the possibility  of inconsistent judgments.3  However,  the
doctrine  cannot  completely  eliminate  that  possibility.  On  the  one
hand,  res judicata  must  be  raised in  the  subsequent  action  by the
party who seeks to take advantage  of it.4 If that party fails to assert
the preclusive effect of the  former adjudication,  a judgment may be
rendered in the subsequent action that is inconsistent with the former
judgment. On the other hand,  inconsistent judgments can result even
when the party entitled to rely upon the initial judgment does  assert
it, but the subsequent court erroneously or willfully refuses to give it
preclusive  effect,  or  correctly  refuses under  its  own  conflicts  law.
The  subsequent  court  may  assert  that  some  requirement  of  res
judicata  is  lacking  or  some  exception  applies,  and  the  resulting
relitigation may then produce a different outcome.
Picture a Mississippi plaintiff who loses a judgment to a New
York defendant in New York (Forum #1  or F-1). The plaintiff needs
a more favorable forum. For that purpose,  she brings an action upon
the same claim in Mississippi (F-2). Mississippi disdains New York
values and so refuses to recognize,  or give effect to, the New  York
judgment, holding it unworthy of full faith and credit. Proceeding to
the merits, the Mississippi court gives judgment for the plaintiff. This

denial  of full  faith  and credit is unconstitutional,'  so the  defendant
appeals,  unsuccessfully.  Finally,  the  plaintiff decides  to  go  back
nearer  the  defendant's  home  in pursuit  of assets  for  enforcement,
suing upon her Mississippi judgment in New Jersey (F-3).
Thus  we encounter "inconsistent judgments,"  defined in the
sense  of F-1  and F-2 judgments,  between the  same parties or their
privies, that differently decide the same claim or issue and that would
each  independently  be  preclusive  in  a  new  action  in  F-3.  To  be
preclusive, both prior courts had to render valid and final judgments
that are recognizable by F-3, where  "valid" roughly means no more
than  that  the  rendering  court  possessed jurisdiction  and  afforded
notice.6  Besides  this  specific  hypothetical,  many  different
circumstances  can generate inconsistent judgments.
When inconsistent judgments do come about, how should the
law handle them? Under the well-known rule followed in the United
States, when there are two inconsistent judgments, it is generally the
later judgment that is entitled to res judicata effects.' That is, if by
failure to assert or apply res judicata two inconsistent judgments are
rendered,  then the  one later rendered has the  controlling preclusive
effects.'  This somewhat  arbitrary  practice  is  called  the last-in-time
rule.  It  forms  part of our  constitutional  doctrine  of full  faith  and
credit.9
So our New York defendant will have to pay in New Jersey.'0
Full faith and credit means that F-3  must bow to an erroneous, even
unconstitutionally erroneous, judgment by F-2, and thus give no faith

and credit at all to F-I's judgment.  Shocking? Now imagine that F-2
is a foreign nation:
Suppose,  for instance, the first judgment is an
American judgment.  If the second action takes place
in Graustark, in the Graustark action one of the parties
relies on the American judgment,  the Graustark court
says, "We will not give any credit to the judgment of
an imperialist court," and so the Graustark court just
rides over the American judgment.
In  that  case  it  seems  rather  doubtful  to  me
whether in the third action,  which takes place  in this
country  again,  the  court  should prefer  the  Graustark
judgment to the American judgment."
Whatever  the  rationales  for  applying  the  last-in-time  rule
domestically,  should  an  American  F-3  ever  prefer  a  foreign  F-2
judgment to an American F-1 judgment?
Part I of this Article will lay out the range of application of
the last-in-time rule under current law. Part II will question the basis
for that rule. Part III will argue for proper limitations on the reach of
the  rule.  The journey  is worthwhile  because  considering  how this
rather  technical  problem  has  been and  should be  resolved  reveals
depths  of not only res judicata  and conflicts  theory, but also of the
legal process entailed in effectuating that theory.
I.  PROBLEMS OF INCONSISTENT JUDGMENTS
These  problems  of  inconsistency  arise  in  a  variety  of
circumstances.  These problems  also involve  the whole  range of res
judicata, and the last-in-time rule applies throughout.
Repetitive litigation of a claim can occur  when the plaintiff
sues again to obtain a better outcome.  More commonly,  the plaintiff
may  sue  again  to  seek  enforcement  elsewhere.  Alternatively,  the
defendant may put the claim back in court by pursuing declaratory or
11.  41 A.L.I. PROC.  277 (1964) (Prof.  Rudolf B.  Schlesinger).  This passage
comes from the transcript of the American Law Institute's debates on what would
become  RESTATEMENT (SECOND)  OF CONFLICT OF LAWS  ยง 114 (AM. LAW INST.
1971).  Graustark  is a  fictional  country  near Romania  that was the  setting  for
several novels by George Barr McCutcheon,  including BEVERLY OF GRAUSTARK
(1904).Winter 2017] LIMTING LAST-IN-TIME RULE 5
injunctive  relief from the judgment or its enforcement.12 Repetitive
litigation  of  an  issue  can  occur  when  the  same  issue  arises  in
subsequent  litigation,  often  in the  course of a different  claim.  The
issue could  constitute part of the merits,  or it could be a threshold
issue such as jurisdiction.
The parties'  incentives that result in inconsistency can cover
a  broad  range.  They may  fail  to  raise  res judicata  as  a  result  of
default, out of ignorance, or by way of litigation strategy where one
or both parties seek a fresh adjudication. Knowing that some law of
res  judicata  will  be  in  play  also  can  shape  strategy,  especially
through forum-shopping.
Sometimes the genesis of the problem is that something has
gone wrong in the  application  of res judicata, joinder,  lis pendens,
forum non conveniens,  or antisuit injunctions.  But often, especially
in international litigation, the genesis lies in the absence of control by
a  higher  law  or  by  a  higher  court  of F-2's  disrespect  for F-i's
judgment.
It is therefore important  to get a handle on what exactly the
last-in-time rule prescribes in all these circumstances.  I shall lay out
the prescriptions by surveying the rule's application  across the three
subdoctrines of res judicata.
A.  Claim Preclusion
For a claim preclusion example, imagine a plaintiff who won
a judgment  but remains  dissatisfied  with  the  amount of damages
awarded.  Instead of seeking enforcement  of the judgment,  she  may
sue  again on the original claim.  The defendant relishes  another try,
especially because he risks less in the second suit (greater damages)
than does the plaintiff (total loss). Although the claim merged in the
prior judgment for the claimant,"  neither party asserts res judicata,
and  so  the  court  holds  another trial  on the  merits  of the  original
claim.  The judgment reached in this second action might be for the
defendant. Hence, inconsistent judgments can come into existence.
First,  if the  same  claim  is  presented  in  a  third action,  the
question will arise as to which, if either, of the now two inconsistent
judgments is to be given preclusive effect in the third action. That is,
if the originally successful plaintiff were now to bring a third action,
12.  GARY  B.  BORN  &  PETER  B.  RUTLEDGE,  INTERNATIONAL  CIVIL
LITIGATION IN UNITED STATES COURTS 567, 1144-45 (5th ed. 2011).
13.  See RESTATEMENT (SECOND)  OF JUDGMENTS  ยง  17(1)  (AM.  LAW  INST.
1982) ("[T]he claim is extinguished and merged in the judgment and a new claim
may arise on the judgment ....  ).6 THE RE VIEW OF LITIGATION [ Vol. 36:1I
which might  be either  an action on the  original  claim or an action
upon  the  first  judgment,  could  the  defendant  invoke  the  second
judgment  as  a defense?  Yes, the  second judgment is entitled to res
judicata effect under the last-in-time rule.14
Second, if the defendant had raised the defense of res judicata
in the plaintiffs second action, but the court had refused to consider
or uphold it, the result would be the same as if the defense had not
been raised, unless the second judgment is appealed and reversed."
Third,  if,  instead  of the  defendant's  winning  the  second
action in the example, the plaintiff had won a judgment for a greater
amount than had been  awarded  in the  first action,  maybe  even by
default,  the  second judgment would  still be  the one  entitled to res
judicata effect.16
B.  Issue Preclusion
Now, for an issue preclusion example, in F-I a fact issue may
go in favor of A  over B, the issue having been actually litigated and
determined  and been  essential  to  the judgment.  If the  same  issue
arises in a second action  in F-2 between  the  same parties but on a
different claim, and A  fails to raise collateral estoppel or F-2 refuses
to consider or uphold it, another trial on the merits might produce an
essential  determination  on  the  issue  in  favor  of B.  For  a  more
concrete example, imagine  a litigated determination  of the value of
some  land  for tax purposes.  Both parties  think that  they could  do
better.  So  they both  would  decline  to  raise  collateral  estoppel  in
litigation of the different claim for a subsequent  tax year's liability.
Another trial on the merits might yield a different valuation.'7  Hence,
again, inconsistent judgments can come into existence.
First, if the  common  issue  appears  in  a third action in  F-3
between the same parties on yet another claim, and B raises collateral

estoppel,  what  happens  in  the  face  of  the  two  inconsistent
judgments? F-3 must accept the determination of F-2.18
Second,  if F-3 and F-I were in fact the same court, the result
would still be that the determination of F-2 prevails. So even though
F-I  acted first,  and even though the proceeding  in F-2  should have
been  precluded,  the  court  in  F-i  must  ignore  its  own  previous
determination of the issue. Indeed, the result is the same if F-2 is the
same  court  as  F-1  or  F-3  or both.19  Although  the  first judgment
normally would  not be  undone  or otherwise  overturned,  it  would
stand shorn henceforth of any continuing relief including preclusive
effects.20
Third,  if the  third  proceeding  were  not  a  third  action  but
merely an appeal in F-1  from the  first judgment, perhaps  even then
the determination of F-2 should govern the disposition of the appeal,
subordinating the earlier trial court determination in F-i  to the later
determination of F-2.21 Yet the appellate court in F-I would naturally
tend to  resist  this  astounding  application  of the  last-in-time  rule.
Indeed,  the better approach  is for the F-i  appellate  court to review
the lower-court decision in the ordinary way, treating res judicata as
any other claim or defense that ordinarily had to have been presented
below  and  thus  not  bowing  to  F-2.22  But  in  the  future,  F-2's
judgment would be the one with preclusive effects.

Finally,  for  an  example  that  involves  the  subdoctrine  of
jurisdiction to determine jurisdiction,23 P of F-1  might sue D of F-2
in F-1, which  upon challenge finds  that personal jurisdiction  exists
over D. F-I  gives judgment for P. Then P brings an action upon the
judgment in F-2, where D's assets  are.  But on collateral  attack,  D
asserts that the prior judgment is  invalid.  F-2 finds that F-I  lacked
personal  jurisdiction,  even  though  the  doctrine  of jurisdiction  to
determine jurisdiction  should have  foreclosed that  issue.  F-2  gives
judgment for D. Finally, P sues upon the first judgment in F-3. Upon
a new collateral attack, the court in F-3 faces inconsistent judgments.
First, on the  issue of personal jurisdiction,  F-3  must accept
the determination of F-2 as the last-in-time.24
Second, even if in the third action P had gone back to F-1  in
order to utilize the first judgment, F-I would be obliged to respect F-
2's judgment over its own judgment.25 However, P could now sue on
his original claim, the statute of limitations permitting.26
Third, if F-i's judgment  went instead by default, then F-2's
decision  on  personal  jurisdiction  would  not  be  an  inconsistent
finding, even if the cases' outcomes were inconsistent.  F-2's finding
on jurisdiction would be preclusive.  It is in fact the only decision on
F-i's  personal  jurisdiction,  which  decision  is  binding  under  the
ordinary rules of issue preclusion.27 Of course, if F-2 had rejected the
collateral attack, that decision would have issue-preclusive effect.28

II.  DISSECTING THE LAW'S RESOLUTION
A.  Rationales of the Rule
Think again of that last hypothetical:  default judgment in F-I
and successful collateral attack in F-2. Such a situation,  where there
are  technically  no  inconsistent  findings  but  the  judgments  are
fundamentally at odds, is quite common and is commonly treated as
a variation of the problem of inconsistent judgments. It can arise not
only when F-2 passes on F-i's invalidity but also where F-2 accepts
another ground for F-i's nonrecognizability.  F-2's decision on F-I's
binding effect is controlling.
Picture  a New York plaintiff who  wins  a judgment by jury
verdict in New York. The defendant's assets  in New York are few,
so  the plaintiff needs  to  enforce  the judgment  elsewhere.  For that
purpose, she brings an action upon the judgment in Mississippi. But
the Mississippi judge unconstitutionally refuses to recognize the New
York judgment,  thus  giving judgment  for the defendant  under  the
influence of local policy.  The plaintiff appeals,  unsuccessfully.  She
finally decides to go closer to home for enforcement, suing upon the
first judgment in New Jersey. However, the plaintiff will fail in New
Jersey.29 As suggested  above, the best explanation  for the result in
this particular situation rests not so much on any rule for inconsistent
determinations,  but  rather  on  the  rule  that  F-2's  decision  on  the

recognizability of F-I's judgment in any other state is binding in F-3
under the ordinary rules of issue preclusion.
The value of this illustration is to reveal that the problem of
inconsistent  judgments  often  involves  two  decisions  in  F-2:  an
implicit  or express  decision  on whether  to respect  F-i's judgment
and then a treatment of the merits that differs from F-i's treatment.
For  those  two  decisions,  different  rationales  arise  to justify  F-3's
bowing to F-2's judgment as last-in-time.
1.  Waiver/Preclusion  on Issue of Full Faith and
Credit
The party entitled to the benefit of res judicata in the second
action was in a position to try to avoid the possibility of inconsistent
judgments. On the one hand, if the benefitee failed to avail himself of
the  opportunity to invoke res judicata, and so allowed the matter to
be relitigated,  he should not be entitled to complain when the second
determination  is treated as conclusive  in a third action.  On the other
hand, if the benefitee did assert his right to preclude, but the second
court  denied  it,  he  should have  sought  correction  of any  error by
appeal from the second court, as with any other error by a trial court.
The American Law Institute's most recent restatement of the
rationale  for  the  last-in-time  rule  buys  into  this  line  of waiver
thinking. It reads thus:
The  considerations  of  policy  which  support  the
doctrine of res judicata are not so strong as to require
that the court apply them of its own motion when the
party himself has failed to claim such benefits as may
flow from them. Accordingly,  when a prior judgment
is  not relied  upon  in  a  pending  action  in  which  it
would have had conclusive  effect as res judicata, the
judgment  in  that  action  is  valid  even  though  it  is
inconsistent with the prior judgment.  It follows that it
is this later judgment, rather than the earlier, that may
be successfully urged as res judicata in a third action,
assuming that other prerequisites are satisfied. Indeed,
the  later  of  the  two  inconsistent  judgments  is
ordinarily held conclusive in a third action even when
the  earlier  judgment  was  relied  on  in  the  secondWinter 2017] LIAITING LAST-IN-TIME RULE 11
action and the  court  erroneously held that it  was not
conclusive.30
Nonetheless,  the  ALI  has  thereby  formulated  a  mighty
peculiar rationale.  We  are to  apply the  later judgment  because  the
party who could have benefited from it waived its benefits by failing
to  urge  the  F-1  judgment  on  the  F-2  court.  However,  the  ALI's
formulation  goes  on  to  provide  the  same  result  even  though  that
party  forwarded the  F-1  judgment in the  loudest  terms possible.  It
seems  that  the  waiver  idea  might  sometimes  give  an  added
motivation to apply the last-in-time rule. But it seems not to qualify
as  a rationale,  because  the  last-in-time  rule  applies  even when the
waiver notion is inapt.
Therefore,  as  the  ALI shifts to the situation  of the  fighting
benefitee, its rationale cannot be waiver.  The ALI instead embraces
the  rationale  of res  judicata. 1  We  should  honor  F-2's  decision
30.  RESTATEMENT (SECOND)  OF JUDGMENTS  ยง  15 cmt.  b (AM.  LAW INST.
1982).
31.  Similarly,  some authorities  forward the rationale that F-2 has implicitly
vacated the F-1 judgment.  See RESTATEMENT (SECOND)  OF CONFLICT OF  LAWS
ยง 114  (AM.  LAW  INST.  1971)  (applying  last-in-time  "if the earlier judgment  is
superseded by the later judgment"); 41 A.L.I. PROC. 278-79 (1964)  (Prof. Michael
Cardozo  IV) (debating what would become the  Second Restatement's ยง 114);  1
FREEMAN, supra note 20, ยง 102, at 181  (maintaining that in some states the later
judgment governs, "the presumption being that the first one has been vacated").
The RESTATEMENT (SECOND)  OF CONFLICT OF LAWS ยง 114 cmt. b (AM. LAW INST.
1971) combines the ideas of waiver and vacatur in its rationale:
The rule of this Section is based upon principles of res judicata
and of full faith and credit. It is appropriate that the losing party
should  be  precluded  from  attacking  the  later  inconsistent
judgment if he has not sought review of this judgment both by
the appellate courts of the State of rendition and by the Supreme
Court of the United States or if the judgment has been affirmed
by these courts. So, if under these circumstances the same issue
has been  differently  decided  in different  actions  between  the
parties, the determination that is later in time should control if it
would  have  this  effect  under  the  local  law  of the  State  of
rendition.  Similarly,  if the  court  in  the  second  action  gives
consideration  to  the  earlier judgment  and  decides,  for  some
reason or other, that this judgment does not bar the action, the
second judgment should control if it would have this effect under
the local  law  of the  State  of rendition.  To  be  sure,  the  later
judgment may be erroneous  and the first judgment correct. But
the parties had the opportunity to litigate the point at issue before
the second court to appeal from its judgment and ultimately to
seek review by the Supreme Court. The parties should be bound
by the  later judgment  so  long  as  it  remains  unreversed  and12 THE RE VIEW OF LITIGATION [ Vol. 36: 1
because  it is a "thing adjudged." A decision  on res judicata is itself
entitled to  preclusive  effect.32  Indeed,  given  the  complexity of res
judicata decisions under American  law, with its carefully delineated
rules and narrowly crafted exceptions, there is especially good reason
to adopt F-2's decision. The point of res judicata is to avoid having
to reconsider the prior adjudication.  So F-2's decision on res judicata
should control even when it was clearly oblivious  or wrong on full
faith and credit.
Actually,  there  will  be  no  inconsistent  decisions  on  res
judicata.  F-1  could  not decide  the  res judicata  effects  of its  own
judgment,  as  only  a later case  can decide  res judicata.33  Thus,  the
only decision on res judicata is F-2's. Because it is the only decision
on point, this last-in-time judgment will govern. True, the result on a
collateral  attack for lack  of jurisdiction might  involve  inconsistent
jurisdictional decisions from F-I and F-2, but the real issue for F-3 is
the res judicata effect of F-I's conclusion on jurisdiction under the
subdoctrine of jurisdiction to determine jurisdiction, and on that issue
F-2 has given the only decision.
Rethink the situation  in which  F-2 decided  that res judicata
by F-i's judgment  did not apply,  because  of some recognizability,
validity,  finality,  or bindingness  defect.  F-2  had a reason to do  so,
and F2 often will have been right. The very idea of res judicata, even
as to an earlier decision about res judicata,  is that F-3 should not get
involved in deciding whether F-2 was right or wrong. Moreover, F-3
simply has no authority to say that F-2  was wrong in deciding that
res judicata did not apply. Only a higher court with jurisdiction over
F-2 had the authority to review it.
Perhaps, then, waiver and preclusion can work in tandem as a
rationale for the last-in-time rule, each rationale  applying separately
to different  situations.34  First, if the benefitee  of the first judgment
provided that the judgment would have this effect under the local
law of the  State of its  rendition.  If the  State  where  the  later
inconsistent judgment is rendered applies  the ordinary rules of
res  judicata,  this  State  will  hold  that  the  later  judgment
supersedes the earlier judgment to the extent that the judgments
are inconsistent.

33.  See FIELD ET AL., supra note 27, at 293, 767-68 (explaining that only in a
second action can res judicata be raised and decided).
34.  Such a tandem motivation is known to the law: (a) if the defendant fails to
raise personal jurisdiction correctly, the jurisdictional point is waived; but (b) if the
defendant raises personal jurisdiction unsuccessfully, the point is precluded by the
res judicata subdoctrine of jurisdiction to determine jurisdiction. CLERMONT, supra
note 23, at 359-60, 363.Winter 2017] LIMTING LAST-IN-TIME  RULE 13
fails  to  invoke  it  in F-2,  then waiver  makes  the  second judgment
binding.  Second,  if the  benefitee  does  assert it,  but the  F-2  court
rejects its bindingness, then F-2's decision on res judicata is binding
and,  consequently,  so  should  its  merits  decisions  be  binding.
Together, waiver and preclusion really drive the U.S.  acceptance  of
last-in-time.
2.  Simplicity of Looking to F-2 on Issue of
Respect for F-1
Other  arguments  for  the  last-in-time  rule,  although  hardly
overwhelming  and  far  less  important  than  waiver/preclusion,  do
exist.  The  initial  supporting  argument  is  that  looking  at the  later
judgment involves less judicial effort.35
If F-3  were  to  take  it  upon  itself to  verify  whether  F-i's
judgment  should  have  been  preclusive  in  F-2,  it  would  have  to
reexamine  that  judgment's  recognizability,  validity,  finality,  and
bindingness,  which F-2's judgment may have already indicated  are
questionable, and probably also examine whether  the winner in F-i
had  waived  the  victory  by  not  pushing  it  sufficiently  in  F-2.
Alternatively,  if F-3  were just to  switch  to  a  first-in-time  rule,  it
would still have to reexamine  the  recognizability, validity,  finality,
and bindingness  of F-i's judgment.  By virtue  of waiver/preclusion,
F-3 can duck these questions and just look to F-2's judgment.
Admittedly,  F-2's  recognizability,  validity,  finality,  or
bindingness  might  be  challengeable  too.  But  in  the  situation  of
inconsistent judgments,  the  status  of F-i's judgment  is  necessarily
questionable. The status of F-2's judgment might be straightforward.
Thus, it should on average slightly reduce the litigatory load to look
to the often less challengeable judgment of F-2 rather than look to F-
I's questionable judgment.36
3.  Reliability of F-2 on the Merits
Another line of argument is that the later judgment is perhaps
more  apt  to  be  well-contested,  well-informed,  and  correct  on  the
35.  See William L. Reynolds, The Iron Law ofFull Faith and Credit, 53 MD.
L. REv. 412, 416 (1994)  (noting that the F-3 court is spared the task of comparing
the judgments of F-I and F-2 and deciding which is correct).
36.  See also infra note 214 and accompanying  text (suggesting another way
that first-in-time is actually the more complicated rule).14 THE RE VIEW OF LITIGATION [ Vol. 36: 1
merits, as it usually resulted from relitigation and redetermination.37
Additionally,  if we  abandon  formalism  for realism,  F-2  may very
well have manipulated its full faith and credit decision because it felt
that F-1  was  wrong on the  merits.  Although  res judicata does  not
customarily  look  to  whether  the  prior judgment  was  correct,  the
lawmaker when  formulating  a rule  of res judicata  need not ignore
which decisions will on average tend to have been correct.38
Counterarguments  to this reliability rationale  do exist.  First,
in the most troubling cases, F-3 will have good reason to think that
F-2  was  wrong,  especially  on  the  res  judicata  effect  of  F-i's
judgment.  Any comfort  drawn  from the supposed wisdom of F-2's
judgment is then likely scant.  Second, the rest of the  world,  as we
shall  see,39  follows the rule that the first-in-time judgment prevails.
Therefore,  it  is  at  best  a  weak  reason  to  favor  the  last-in-time
judgment that it is slightly more reliable.
Other arguments, along the lines that F-2 somehow gave the
more legitimate  prior decision,  vaporize  on closer inspection.  One
such argument stresses that America's  early last-in-time precedents
arose in a federal nation nurturing full faith and credit, which aimed
at  converting  the  American  sovereigns  from  a  grouping  of
"independent  foreign  sovereignties"  into  "integral parts  of a single
nation."40  The argument runs that this full faith and credit principle
naturally  implies  looking  at  the  nation's  latest  word  without
inquiring into whether it was erroneous. However,  one could almost
as easily argue that full faith  and credit implies  looking at the first
word,  given  its  having  subsequently  been  disrespected.  Moreover,
elsewhere in the world, federalism has not led to a last-in-time rule.41
37.  See 18 WRIGHT ET AL.,  supra note 20, ยง 4423, at 619. One might think
that the better-known last-in-time rule for treaties lends some tangential support. It
extends the principle of leges posteriorsp riores contrariasa brogant (later laws
abrogate  prior  contrary  laws).  But  the  principle  rests  on  textual,  structural,
historical,  and  functional  grounds  different  from the grounds  for  full  faith  and
credit. See generally Julian G. Ku, Treatiesa s Laws: A Defense of the Last-in-Time
Rule for Treaties and FederalS tatutes, 80 IND. L.J. 319 (2005).

1982)  ("Giving a prior determination of an issue conclusive  effect in subsequent
litigation is justified not merely as avoiding further costs of litigation but also by
underlying confidence that the result reached is substantially correct.").

4.  Finality on the Merits
One  last rationale  is  quite  different  from waiver/preclusion,
simplicity,  and reliability.  In order to avoid  relitigation,  one of the
inconsistent  judgments,  be  it  the  first-in-time  or  the  last-in-time,
must prevail.  In  other  words,  the  goal  of finality  calls  for having
some rule in place, even an arbitrary one.
However, this finality argument is not too strong. Supporters
of the rule may raise the specter of theoretically endless relitigation,
but in fact that risk does not exist. The approach could be that neither
F-I's nor F-2's judgment is binding and that F-3's fresh decision will
act as the henceforth-preclusive  tiebreaker.  Alternatively, the system
could provide, with nonfatal consequences  to itself, that inconsistent
results mean no preclusion ever'on the point. Yet current law usually
eschews both of these approaches,42 except that inconsistent findings
may  prevent  any  future  invocation  of  nonmutual  collateral
estoppel.43
In sum, the last-in-time rule exists because we would like one
of the inconsistent judgments to be final, and it might as well be the
later judgment both on the logic of waiver/preclusion and also in the
interests of simplicity and reliability.44 The rule is close to being an
42.  But see Shaw v. Broadbent, 29 N.E. 238, 241  (N.Y.  1891) (holding that
"one estoppel neutralizes the other, and the. question is left to be tried over"); cf
Bata v. Bata, 163 A.2d 493, 506 (Del.  1960) (dictum) ("It has been suggested that
in the face of two conflicting foreign determinations, involving a common question
but different causes of action, the court of the forum  should disregard both and
should proceed  at once  to  the  merits.").  No  case has  ever  followed  the  Shaw
holding,  and  several  have  expressly  rejected  it.  E.g.,  Bd.  of  Dirs.  of  Chi.
Theological Seminary v. People ex rel. Raymond, 59 N.E. 977, 980 (Ill.  1901).
43.  See RESTATEMENT  (SECOND)  OF JUDGMENTS  ยง 29(4)  cmt.  f (AM.  LAW
INST.  1982) (listing as a discretionary factor against nonmutual preclusion that the
"determination  relied  on  as preclusive  is  itself inconsistent  with  some  other
adjudication  of the same  issue"). Nonmutual collateral  estoppel  differs  from the
problem  of inconsistent judgments  in  that  only one  of the  prior judgments  is
potentially preclusive in F-3. The inconsistency of determinations is then just an
argument,  applicable  only  in  the  context  of nonmutuality,  against  giving that
judgment its normal preclusive effect.
For another example of nonpreclusion as the solution, the Second Restatement
provides that where a judgment rests on alternative findings, neither is binding. Id.

44.  For such a listing of reasons, see Robi v. Five Platters, Inc., 838 F.2d 318,
322-23 (9th Cir. 1988) (other citations omitted):
When two inconsistent judgments exist, it is tempting for a
court to reexamine the merits of the litigants' dispute and choose
the result it likes best. There are important reasons to avoid this16  THE RE VIEW OF LITIGATION  [Vol. 36:1
arbitrary rule for the sake of having a rule, but it is not a particularly
bad rule.
B.  Development of the Rule
1.  Emergence
The last-in-time rule merely happened. For the kinds of cases
American  courts  were  encountering,  the  foregoing rationales  made
last-in-time  seem the natural  solution. The rule's development adds
to the sense of its arbitrariness.
Early  on,  the  problem  arose  rarely,  in  state4  and  federal46
cases.  In the primitive problem's sequence of three actions, all three
temptation. First, if one party could have raised res judicata, but
did  not,  that  litigant  must  bear  the  cost  of  its  tactic  or
inadvertence.  Second, the most recent court to decide the matter
may have  considered  and rejected  the  operation  of the  prior
judgment as res judicata, and its decision  should be treated as
res judicata on  the  preclusive  effect  of the  prior judgment.
Finally, the last in time rule is supported by the rationale that it
"'end[s]  the  chain  of relitigation  ...  by  stopping  it where  it
[stands]'  after entry of the  [most recent]  court's judgment, and
thereby  discourages  relitigation  in  [yet  another]  court."  Id.
(quoting  Porter v.  Wilson, 419  F.2d 254, 259  (9th  Cir.1969),
cert. denied, 397 U.S.  1020,  90 S.  Ct.  1260, 25 L.  Ed.2d 531
(1970)).  Therefore,  even when  we think  that  the  most  recent
judgment might be wrong, we still give it res judicata effect, so
that finality is achieved and the parties are encouraged to appeal
an inconsistent judgment directly rather than attack it collaterally
before another court.

the  actions  would  be  interjurisdictional  but  still  all  American.48
Mostly the cases  involved the situation in which the benefitee of the
F-i judgment  failed to raise  it in F-2, so that the waiver notion by
itself  made  the  last-in-time  judgment  the  natural  choice.49

law  accumulated,  some  of the  cases  involved  the  court  in  F-2

underlying the rule received little discussion in the courts.

involving inconsistent judgments came to recite the last-in-time rule

treatise on judgments stated the last-in-time rule from its first edition

treatise stated the rule nicely:
The last judgment rendered in regard-to a matter is res
judicata." The  former  judgment  must  be  used  to
prevent it.. .. But if he does not bring that fact to the

We  are of opinion that,  having in his hands a
good  defence  at  the  time  judgment  was  rendered
against him [in  F-2], namely,  the  order of discharge
[in  F-1],  and  having  failed  to  present  it  to  a  court
which  had  jurisdiction  of his  case,  and  of all  the
defences which  he might have  made,  including this,
the judgment is a valid judgment, and that the defence
cannot be set up here in an action on that judgment [in
F-3].60
In  1939,  the  Supreme Court took  a giant step further  in its
leading  case  on  this  problem.  Treinies v.  Sunshine Mining  Co.
involved  a  fight over mining company stock between  stepdaughter
and  stepfather.61 First,  a Washington  probate  court,  after making  a
litigated determination that it had subject-matter jurisdiction, held for
the  stepfather.62  Second,  he  relied  on  that judgment  in  an  Idaho
proceeding, but the Idaho court found that the Washington court had
lacked  subject-matter  jurisdiction.63  The  stepfather  unsuccessfully
appealed  the  full  faith  and  credit  question  to  the  Idaho  Supreme
Court and then unsuccessfully petitioned for certiorari.64  On remand,
the  trial  court  determined  ownership  in  the  stepdaughter,  and  the
stepfather took no further appeal from that final judgment.65  Third,
Washington's subject-matter jurisdiction and the parties'  ownership
questions reappeared in an interpleader  suit in the District of Idaho,
which applied the last-in-time rule in favor of the stepdaughter.66 The
U.S.  Supreme  Court  affirmed:  "Even  where  the  decision  against
validity of the original judgment is erroneous, it is a valid exercise of
judicial power by the second court. One trial of an issue is enough."67
Any waiver argument based on a failure to assert res judicata
in F-2  was  unavailable  on the  facts  of Treinies. Consequently,  its
holding represents  a significant expansion of the last-in-time  rule to
nonwaiver situations.  However,  the  Court did not explain or justify
60.  Id. at 566. Subsequently, the Supreme Court applied the last-in-time rule
without formulating,  explaining, or justifying it, once citing Dimock, Boynton v.
Ball,  121  U.S.  457, 463-64 (1887),  but usually not citing Dimock, e.g., Davis v.

itself. None of the courts or the parties involved in the case expressly
mentioned  "last-in-time,"  and none cited Dimock. Their debate was
over whether F-3  should reconsider the duty of F-2 to give full faith
and credit to F-I's judgment68 or whether full faith and credit to F-
2's judgment meant ignoring possible errors in that judgment.69  The
Court  simply barreled  down  the  latter  route  by  assuming  that the
latest judgment controlled.70
With Treinies recently  entered  on the books,  the  American
Law Institute was compelled to address the matter for the first time.
Its involvement would prove crucial because of the Supreme Court's
failure to formulate the doctrine explicitly. In fact, through a series of
four different projects over the years, the ALI has played an outsized
role in the development of the doctrine.
In 1942, the Restatement of Judgments  codified and extended
the Treinies result, by sweepingly providing a last-in-time rule for all
of res judicata,  whether or not a waiver argument was  available. Its
blackletter  stated:  "Where  in  two  successive  actions  between  the
same  parties inconsistent judgments  are rendered,  the judgment  in
the  second  action  is  controlling  in  a  third  action  between  the
parties."71 The Restatement  stated  the  rule not  only as  a matter  of
domestic res judicata  law but also  as  the  law  governing  interstate
situations.72  The  appended  comments  gave  no  rationale,  and  the
Restatement  contained no reporter's notes. The  section appeared  in
essentially  identical  form  in the  initial  drafts 73  and  seems  to  have
received  no group  attention  or discussion  at the annual meetings.74
The broad rule apparently was accepted as well-settled.

By  far  the  premier  citation  on  this  subject  is  the  1969
Harvard Law  Review  article  by  then-Professor  Ruth  Bader
Ginsburg.7"  It was a simply constructed  article.  She focused on the
internal  American  approach,  putting  international  litigation  to  the
side.76 The article proceeded in just two parts.
The first part recited in detail the four leading Supreme Court
precedents at that time.77  She showed how those cases enshrined the
last-in-time  rule.78  It  applied  not  only  where  the  benefited  party
waived the F-1  judgment by failing to  assert it,  but also where  the
party  strongly  resisted  F-2's  denial  of full  faith  and  credit.79  It
applied even where F-I and F-3 were the same courts.80
The  second part discussed  three  state cases that had flouted
their seeming duty to apply the last-in-time rule, tending in particular
to do so when F-i and F-3  were the same courts.81 These cases met
counts.  That is true where the judgments are inconsistent with each  other,  and  it

the Supreme Court to grant certiorari and put down the rebellion.
A  point made  almost  in passing  in the  article  attracted the
most attention and still receives regular citation. It was her suggested
limitation on F-3's full faith and credit obligation to honor the last-
in-time:
But  the  Court  has  not  yet  considered  the  ultimate
question: where credit for the first state's judgment is
demanded  but  denied  in  the  second  state  and  the
diligent pursuit of the appellate route concludes with a
denial  of  certiorari,  does  the  lastin-time  rule  still
apply? Justification  for the rule depends  on both the
full faith and credit obligation of the second state, and
the availability of an impartial  tribunal to correct the
second  state's  error,  should  it  fail  to  give  the  first
judgment the respect constitutionally due it. When the
impartial  arbiter refuses  to  act,  however,  the  second

83.  Ginsburg, supra note 75,  at 811-19.  Despite her plea, the rebellion still
simmers. See,  e.g., Medveskas v. Karparis, 640 A.2d 543 (Vt.  1994) (involving a
sequence  of Vermont,  Massachusetts,  and Vermont  support  actions,  where the
benefitee of the F-1 judgment had raised it unsuccessfully  in F-2). But see, e.g.,
Thoma v.  Thoma,  934 P.2d 1066,  1070-71  (N.M.  Ct. App.  1996)  ("Cases like
Medveskas exemplify the parochial  attitude that the Full Faith and Credit Clause
was intended to override."). Denial of certiorari without dissent in cases presenting
the problem during her time on the Court include Stauber v.  McGrath, 555 U.S.
969 (2008)  (involving a sequence of Ohio, California, and Ohio paternity actions,
where the benefitee of the F-1 judgment had raised it unsuccessfully in F-2; Ohio

state's rejection  of the  first  state's judgment  should
not automatically become the national solution to the
matter in controversy. Rather, the court subsequently
confronted with the  conflicting judgments  should,  in
effect, provide the check  unsuccessfully sought from
the Supreme Court.84
In her view, if the second action is brought in a different state from
the  state  of the  first judgment's rendition;  the  court  in the  second
action refuses to  accord preclusive effect to the  first judgment;  the
appellate  courts of the second state affirm;  the U.S.  Supreme Court
denies  certiorari;  the  matter  arises  in  a third  action;  and the  third
court finds the second court's full faith and credit decision  to be in
contravention  of the Full Faith  and Credit Clause85  and Act,86 then
the  third court should  give  full  faith  and credit to  the  first court's
judgment.
3.  Retrenchment
The second version of the Restatement of Conflict of Laws in
1971  added  a  section  to  treat  inconsistent  judgments.  Expressly
relying  on  the  Restatement  of Judgments'  provision,  it  stated  an
elaborated blackletter rule:
A judgment rendered  in a  State of the  United States
will not be recognized or enforced in sister States if an
inconsistent,  but  valid,  judgment  is  subsequently
rendered in another action between  the parties and if
the  earlier  judgment  is  superseded  by  the  later
judgment under the  local law of the  State  where  the
later judgment was rendered.
84.  Ginsburg, supra note 75,  at 831-32; see id at 803-04 ("Hence,  such a
denial  of certiorari  seems  hardly an  appropriate  basis  for  endowing  F-2  with
ultimate  authority  to  displace  F-i's  adjudication  with  its  own."),  805-06
("However,  when the national tribunal fails to act,  despite a properly timed and
formally correct invitation for review,  some of the distinctions between interstate
and international judgments, significant at earlier stages, lose force....  Rather, the
recognition forum should attempt to function as surrogate arbiter and view the case
from the perspective the Supreme Court would have taken had it granted review.").

Significantly, its final comment qualified the scope of the rule: "It is
uncertain  whether  the  rule  of  this  Section  will  be  applied  to
judgments  rendered  in  a  foreign  nation." 89  Moreover,  its  initial
comment ungrammatically  and ambiguously added this qualification:
"The  rule  of  this  Section  is  applicable  if the  later  inconsistent
judgment is valid (see  ยง 92) and, provided at least, that the Supreme
Court of the United States has not refused to review this judgment."90
This was  a last-minute  bow to  Professor Ginsburg,  whose  recently
published article received a "see  generally" citation in the reporter's
note,  the  only  citation  to  commentary  in  the  note.91  Unlike  the
Restatement of Judgments' provision on inconsistent judgments, this
section in the Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws received hot
debate at the annual meeting when first proposed in rather sweeping
terms.92  The  provision  was  attacked  on  the  ground  that  "it
encourages  relitigation"  and  "jurisdiction hunting."93 On  a  deeper
level,  the concerns  were over whether  the section should  extend to
foreign-nation judgments94 and whether it should extend to domestic
judgments  denying  full  faith  and credit.95  The  section  accordingly
evolved  over  time  to  acquire  its  foreign-nation  qualification  and,
eventually, the Ginsburg qualification.96

The  American  Law  Institute  revisited  the  problem  of
inconsistent  judgments  in  1982's  Restatement  (Second)  of
Judgments.  Its  blackletter  read:  "When  in two  actions  inconsistent
final judgments are rendered,  it is the later, not the earlier, judgment
that is accorded conclusive effect in a third action under the rules  of
res judicata."97  First, as the Judgments project treats only an internal
law  of res  judicata,  it  does  not  touch  foreign-nation  judgments.
Second, the drafting effort initially embraced and then abandoned the
Ginsburg  qualification.98  The initial  reporters,  Professors  Benjamin
Kaplan  and  David  L.  Shapiro,  posed  her hypothetical  of denied
certiorari  as the  central question to be faced in drafting the relevant
section.99 In the preliminary draft submitted to the project's Advisers
for discussion in October 1972, they followed the earlier Restatement
of Judgments and the Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws, but
added a comment that would allow F-3 to reconsider F-2's full faith
and  credit  decision  at  the  behest  of a  party  denied  certiorari."oo
Almost  immediately,  however,  they  retreated  to  a  mere  cross-
reference to the reservation of the point in the Restatement (Second)
of Conflict of Laws. 101  That approach carried forward,102  producing
no  discussion  at the  annual  meeting.1 03  Essentially,  the  American

The U.S.  Supreme Court has since returned to the problem of
inconsistent judgments, and its capstone message  explained that, for
American judgments,  American law  embodies  the  last-in-time  rule
seemingly unadorned by exceptions. In the ParsonsS teel case,104 the
sequence began with plaintiffs suing a bank for fraud in an Alabama
court. A couple of months later, they sued the bank for the same acts
under a federal banking  statute  in the  federal  court  for the  Middle
District of Alabama. The federal action went to judgment first (F-1),
with a decision for the bank.  The bank then asserted claim and issue
preclusion  in the  state  action,  but the  state  court  ruled against  res
judicata  without  giving  reasons  and  awarded  the  plaintiffs
$4,000,001  in damages (F-2), against which the bank filed post-trial
motions. The bank immediately returned to the same federal district
court,  which  decided  that  its  prior judgment  was  claim-preclusive
and so  issued  an injunction  against enforcement  by the  state-court
plaintiffs  (F-3).  The  court of appeals  affirmed  in relevant part.  The
Supreme Court unanimously reversed the federal-court injunction:
Once the state court has finally rejected a claim of res
judicata, then the Full Faith and Credit  Act becomes
applicable and federal courts must turn to state law to
determine  the  preclusive  effect  of the  state  court's
decision.

Maybe  the  ALI  should  have  faced  its  reserved  questions.
Maybe  the  Supreme  Court  should have  spoken  more  precisely,  to
avoid being seen as sidestepping those questions. If modem law had
the gumption to answer, is the Ginsburg exception sound? No.
Although she had no case support for her exception, hers was
a  plausible  proposal.  It  was  arguable  that  the  party  claiming  the
benefit of the first judgment should not be bound by the preclusive
effect of the second judgment if the Supreme Court denies certiorari.
After  all,  the  party  could  have  done  nothing  more  to  avoid  an
inconsistent judgment,  and the nation's neutral arbiter had failed to
act.  Moreover,  her  hypothetical  has  emotional  force.  It  tempts
because  it involves a. past error on preclusion when we are trying to
decide  about  preclusion  and  because  it  inspires  a  distaste  for
respecting  the  disrespecting  F-2.  At  the  very  least,  her  scenario
works well to expose,  on peculiarly wrenching facts,  the somewhat
arbitrarily cruel nature of the last-in-time rule.
Her solution was to cast preclusion aside as a rationale for the
last-in-time  rule.  She  in essence  embraced  waiver  as  the  exclusive
rationale.  She  would apply the  last-in-time  rule only when waiver,
however  attenuated,  bolstered  the  second  state's  judgment.  To
accommodate the case law, she had to extend waiver to the extreme
of requiring the benefitee  to pursue the res judicata  point as  far as
possible  in F-2,  going after the very  final judgment  all  the way to
certiorari  whether or not it would be rational to  do so.  Then  if the
Supreme Court denied audience to the benefitee, the last-in-time rule
would cease to apply.
Waiver makes the most sense, however,  if what it means  is
failure  to  assert res judicata in  F-2 at all.  Prior  cases  had utilized
preclusion as a partial rationale  for stretching the last-in-time rule to
situations where the benefitee had in fact asserted res judicata in F-2.
A  preclusion  rationale  would  honor a  final  decision of F-2  on res
judicata,  while  her  approach  would  not  if  the  loser  banged
unsuccessfully on the doors of the U.S.  Supreme Court.
Her approach collides with the rest  of res judicata  doctrine.
Res  judicata  frequently  enshrines  erroneous  judgments,  including
those to which the  Supreme Court has denied certiorari.  It needs to
do this to accomplish its aims. Errors in applying res judicata are no
different from any kind of error. They certainly are no more serious
than errors as to due process,  equal protection, or the jury right, all
being errors  as  to which  res judicata routinely makes  courts  turn a
enjoined its enforcement,  and the  court of appeals  affirmed.  First Ala. Bank of
Montgomery, N.A. v. Parsons Steel, Inc., 825 F.2d 1475 (11th Cir. 1987).28 THE RE VIEW OF LITIGATION [ Vol. 36: 1
blind eye despite  the denial of certiorari.  Her giving the relentless,
but  unsuccessful,  res judicata  disputant  a  break  clashes  with  the
treatment of all other litigants.106
To  be  consistent  with  the  rest  of res judicata,  we  should
protect  the  second  judgment  here  by  the  usual  last-in-time  rule.
Additionally, the other rationales for the last-in-time rule carry over.
They push toward application  of the usual rule even in her extreme
scenario. One judgment should prevail as final, without reexamining
the  merits  of the  prior judgments.  Also,  it  is  more  reliable  and
simpler to accept the  last judgment.  Yet  Professor Ginsburg would
have F-3 second-guess  F-2's preclusion decision when certiorari had
been denied.
The later case law,  such as  it is,  is against her.  In Porter v.
Wilson, the Ninth Circuit had to  consider four lawsuits.'07  Arizona
had issued the first judgment on ownership of a hotel. Idaho decided
that  Arizona's  judgment  was  not  binding  for  lack  of personal
jurisdiction  and  so  rendered  an  inconsistent  judgment.'o  Arizona
then decided  that the Idaho judgment did not deserve  full faith and
credit and so stuck to its view of the dispute, a decision on which the
U.S.  Supreme Court denied certiorari.109 The District of Arizona, in a
new  diversity  action,  decided  that  the  last judgment  was  binding,
whether  it was  right or  wrong,  and the  court  of appeals  affirmed:
"Defendants'  basic  error,  it  seems  to  us,  lies  in  the  mistaken
assumption that it was the role of the federal district court to review
and revise the decision of the Supreme Court of Arizona on the issue
presented to that court under the full faith and credit clause."'10
In  First  Tennessee  Bank  NA.  Memphis  v.  Smith,  a
Mississippi  probate  judgment  preceded  an  Arkansas  probate
judgment, which led to a federal interpleader action."'  The Arkansas
courts, right up to the state supreme court,  had refused to recognize
the  Mississippi  judgment  because  of lack  of jurisdiction.112  The
aggrieved  bank  then  had  petitioned  for  certiorari,  but  the  U.S.

federal-federal  permutations;  or a matter of highly  uniform  state
law if F-2 and F-3 are the same U.S.  state.119
This governing law on recognition needs to be distinguished
from other choices  of law. Recognition  for present purposes means
only whether  F-3  will look to a prior judgment, provided that it is
valid, final, and preclusive under applicable law. A valid judgment is
one  of sufficient  quality  to  withstand  an  attack  in  the  form  of a
request for relief from judgment,  which  will  typically lie  only  for
lack  of jurisdiction  or  notice  and  not  for  other  error.120  A  final
judgment  is  one  that  is not  tentative  or provisional,  which  in the
United States generally means it was the trial court's last word on the
merits.121  Preclusion  turns  on  all  the  rules  and  exceptions  of res
judicata law.122
When  F-3  faces  the  question  of whether  F-2's judgment  is
valid and final,  it normally  should  apply the  law  of F-2  (which  is
subject to any applicable external restraints,  such as due process and
other federal provisions imposed on and becoming part of the F-2's
law).123  When F-3  faces  the  question of the  extent or reach of res
judicata based on F-2's judgment,  it normally should apply the res
judicata law that F-2 would apply (including any applicable external
restraints).124 Thus, once over the initial recognition hurdle, the basic
approach is retroverse, in the sense of turning backward to look at F-

C.  ComparativeP  icture
Before  getting  to  how  American  courts  should  treat
inconsistent foreign-nation judgments, I need to take a look at how
the rest of the world handles the problem of inconsistent judgments.
This comparative  study will  shed light backward  on the  rationales
and  development  of  the  American  last-in-time  rule,  as  well  as
forward on treatment of foreign-nation judgments.
In brief, the rest of the world does not follow our last-in-time
rule. They follow a first-in-time rule. This comparison reinforces the
feeling that our rule is a rather arbitrary one.
1.  England and Most of Its Progeny
English and Commonwealth law on res judicata is middlingly
expansive.126  It was slower to develop than American law,  and still
does  not reach  as  far.127  It  provides  fairly narrow  forms  of claim
preclusion and  mutual  issue preclusion.' 28  Yet,  it seems  poised to
expand res judicata further.129
On  the  problem  of  inconsistent  judgments,  England's
treatises' 30  and international  casesl31 make clear that it follows the

first-in-time  approach.  It  seemingly does  so  on the  undertheorized
idea that once  things are  settled, they should remain settled.  But it
seems to occur to no one that a subsequent decision of nonpreclusion
might  itself be entitled to preclusion.  The Privy  Council  explained
the split from the American approach:
Some  reference  was  made  in  the  course  of
argument  to  the  position  in  the  law  of the  United
States of America, where the last-in-time rule appears
to be applied in the case of conflicting judgments,  at
least when the  matter arises  in an inter-state  context
where  the  "full  faith  and  credit"  clause  of  the
Constitution  applies....  The  rationale  of the  rule
appears to be that the second judgment has the effect
of deciding that the first judgment does not constitute
res judicata so that the second constitutes res judicata
of that issue as  well as  of any others  that may have
been raised. This is so whether or not the issue of res
judicata was argued in the  second proceeding by the
party  who  was  successful  in  the  first,  because  on
ordinary principles a party is not entitled to raise in a
later proceeding a point which was open to him in an
earlier one but which he did not take. Their Lordships
do not consider that the position in the United States
is of assistance for present purposes ... 132
Worth noting is that in the international cases generating the
first-in-time  rule,  the  first  judgment  was  most  often  an  English
judgment. 
133
English  law  provides  the  possibility  of  cross-estoppel,
whereby the failure by the winner in F-i to raise res judicata in F-2
will  equitably  estop  that  party,  and  so  F-2  will be  the  preclusive
131.  See Vervaeke  v.  Smith  [1983]  1  AC  145  (HL) (applying  first-in-time

judgment.134 In other words, here England applies a last-in-time rule.
These cross-estoppel  cases most often are domestic cases. Their rule
makes much  sense.  Failure to raise res judicata is  a solid basis for
waiver.  Just like any other defense, the benefitee  is obliged to raise
or lose it.
Canada,  as  a  federal  country,  provides  an  interesting
variation.  Its  res  judicata  is  founded  on  the  English  approach,135
although  it  is  not  immune  to  influences  from the  more  expansive
American  approach.136  For  two  foreign-nation  judgments  or  two
intraprovincial  judgments,  a Canadian  province  follows  England's
first-in-time rule.137
The  curious  thing  for  an  American,  however,  is  that  the
Canadian federation does not have a full faith  and credit provision.
The  provinces  treat  judgments  from  other  provinces  as  foreign
judgments.138  When  a  province's  judgment  is  inconsistent  with
another  province's  judgment  or  any  other  foreign  judgment,  the

2.  Civil-Law Countries
Civil-law res judicata is relatively narrow in scope. Its aim is
merely to keep a cause of action, once resolved for either plaintiff or
defendant,  from  being  reconsidered.  There  is  little  by  way  of
collateral estoppel  and jurisdiction to determine jurisdiction,  and no
res judicata as to res judicata determinations.140  However,  there are
signs  in  a  number  of  countries  of a  doctrine  on  the  brink  of
expansion."141
On the problem of inconsistent judgments, a striking aspect is
the  civil  law's  lack  of discussion  of the  problem  as  a  matter  of
domestic law. The domestic doctrine,  such as it is today, favors the
first-in-time  rule.  When  inconsistent judgments  inevitably  came to
present  themselves  in  international  litigation,  the  civilians  had  to
confront it consciously.  But defensibly parochial  impulses were then
in  play,  so  that  the  codes  tended  to  go  with  the  local judgment
whether first or last.
Why  does  this  problem  seem  smaller  to  civilians?  The
explanation  might  be  that  we  are  more  comfortable  in
acknowledging  inconsistencies.  More probably,  the  problem  arises

preference for local proceedings into the arena of pending cases, so that the foreign

res judicata.  Narrower res judicata means that res judicata will apply
less  often  in  a  second  action,  to  say  nothing  of  a  third  action.
Moreover, without collateral estoppel, the problem would arise only
in  the  more  unlikely  scenario  of repetitive  assertion  of the  same
cause  of action  involving  the  same parties.  In  such  a  scenario  the
doctrines  of res judicata and  lis pendens  usually will work well  to
prevent inconsistency  from arising in the first place.  The doctrines
will work  even  better  given that  civil-law judges  in F-2  can  raise
them sua  sponte,142 and given that the judges sitting without a jury
will avoid inconsistent  determinations  thanks to the prior judgment
being  admissible  in  evidence  on  the  merits.143  Finally,  civil-law
countries  define  "inconsistent"  narrowly.'"  The  tendency  is  to
require  something  like  legal  consequences  that  mutually  exclude
each other.145
Take Germany as the prime example.146 Unlike Canadian and
U.S.  federalism, Germany treats a judgment of any German state as a
German  judgment,  automatically  enforceable  anywhere  in  the
country.147  "Conflicts  between  judgments  rendered  by  different
German  courts  are  usually  resolved  according  to  the  priority
principle  (Priorititsprinzip)-'first  in  time,  first  in  right."'148
Although  the  same  principle  applies  to  conflicts  between  foreign
judgments, when the inconsistency is between any German judgment
and a foreign judgment, the German judgment prevails. The relevant
code prohibits recognition  of a foreign judgment between the same
parties on the  same subject matter if the "judgment is  incompatible

$275,000.'15  By  service  in  Japan,  Marubeni  America  impleaded
Kansai,  which  attacked  jurisdiction.156  The  Supreme  Court  of
Washington  upheld jurisdictional power  on the ground  that Kansai
had  transacted  business  in  Washington  by  building  the  press  to
Boeing's  extensive  specifications,  by  sending  to  Washington  its
engineers to test and inspect the press and to oversee repairs, and by
sending replacement parts to Washington; moreover, the court found
the  exercise  of jurisdiction  not  to  be  unreasonable  in  view  of
Kansai's other extensive business in the United States, the burden on
Marubeni  America,  and the  location  of evidence. 57  On  September
17,  1974,  the  trial  court  awarded  Marubeni  America  a judgment
against Kansai for $86,000.1ss
F-2: Meanwhile,  Kansai  was  not  asleep  in  Japan.  It  sued
Marubeni America in the Osaka District Court to declare nonliability
for  indemnification. 159  After  stretching  to  find  jurisdiction,  the
Japanese court followed precedent to reject a lis pendens defense by
construing  the word  "court"  in the code's prohibition  to mean that
the  prior  action  had  to  be  pending  in  a  Japanese  court.160  The
Washington judgment,  valid and  final  under Washington  law,  was
not final under Japanese law because there was still time to appeal.161
On October  14,  1974, the  Osaka District Court ruled that Marubeni
America had  no right to indemnity under  Japanese  contract or tort
law. 162
F-3:  Next,  Marubeni  America  sued  Kansai  upon  its
Washington judgment in that same Japanese court. In 1977, the court
rejected  that  claim,  denying  recognition  on  the  ground  that  the
Washington judgment was inconsistent with a Japanese judgment (its
own 1974 judgment) and hence was contrary to the public policy of
Japan, regardless of the two judgments' sequencing.163

By any view,  this ten-year battle  of lawsuits is  not a pretty
picture. In the U.S.  view, the Japanese court in 1974 should probably
have  given res judicata effect to the  Washington judgment.  But the
Japanese  court  refused  to  go  that  route,  and  the  result  was
inconsistent judgments.  In the Japanese  view, the Japanese  court in
1977 was likely right in preferring its own prior judgment.
The  civilians'  preference  for  local  judgments  is  further
indulged by  their willingness,  as  seen  in Marubeni, to apply  their
own  law  to  the  validity,  finality,  and  bindingness  of the  foreign-
nation's  judgment.16  The  result  might  then  be  that  the  foreign
nation's judgment  never  gets  into  the  running  as  an  inconsistent
judgment.
3.  European Union
Under  the  2015  revision  of  the  Brussels  Regulation,  a
member  state  must  not  recognize  or  enforcel65  another  member
state's judgment "if the judgment is irreconcilable  with a judgment
given between the same parties in the Member State addressed" 66  or
"if the judgment is irreconcilable with an earlier judgment given in
another Member State or in a third State involving the same cause of
action  and  between  the  same  parties,  provided  that  the  earlier
judgment  fulfils the conditions  necessary  for its  recognition  in the
Member  State  addressed." 167  Irreconcilability  arises when  the  two
judgments entail "mutually exclusive legal consequences."168
The  Regulation  thus  follows  the  first-in-time  rule,  except
when F-2 and F-3 are courts of the same member state. However, the
Regulation fails to cover the  situation where F-i  and F-2 are courts
of the same member state, which leaves the problem to the national
law of F-1  and F-2.'69 F-3's national  law governs when neither F-1

4.  Comparative Summary
Occasional  exceptions  aside,  the  national  and  EU  law that
generally prevails  in  Europe, including in England,173  fits a simple
and coherent pattern:  the first judgment governs-unless one of the
inconsistentj udgments is a localj udgment, which then prevails. At a
glance, the situation there stands in what seems to be stark contrast to
the law of the United States.
Why?  In  this  corner  of  the  law,  the  solution  is  path-
dependent. A legal system's rule arises in a certain context, and then
it proceeds to have a life of its own.

the  EU Regulation  art.  45  did  not apply  and  saying that  "the  recognition and
enforcement procedures enable a judgment to have the same effect in the Member
State addressed as it would have had in the Member State of origin").

in-time  line.  Its  Regulation  Concerning  Jurisdiction  and  the  Recognition  and

Responsibility adopts a last-in-time for judgments on parental responsibility for the

The  early  cases  in  the  United  States  were  domestic  cases
involving the benefitee's  failure  to assert res judicata in F-2.174 For
these,  last-in-time  seemed  the  natural  answer.  Because  of  the
expansiveness  of  American  res  judicata,  the  cases  presenting
inconsistent  judgments  multiplied  and  last-in-time  became
entrenched.  Because America's  devotion to res judicata meant that
we  should honor decisions  about res judicata,  last-in-time  came  to
apply  in  situations  where  the  benefitee  asserted  res  judicata
unsuccessfully in F-2.
Elsewhere  in the world,  the problem tended to present  itself
with obviousness in international cases, and parochialism defensibly
led to a preference for any local judgment.  A lesser devotion to res
judicata led to a first-in-time rule when the time came to backfill a
solution  for  the  problem's  rarer  contexts.  This  solution  could  be
leavened  by  notions  of waiver,  however,  as  achieved  by  cross-
estoppel in England where a relatively broader res judicata has led to
a more developed law on inconsistent judgments.
But perhaps  the  difference  between  the  American  solution
and  that  of the  rest  of the  world  is  not as  stark  as  a  first  glance
suggests.  If the United States were not to apply its last-in-time rule
sometimes  when  a  foreign-nation  judgment  was  involved,  and  if
other countries would adopt the British notion of cross-estoppel, the
difference  between  the  United  States  and the  rest  of world would
become  not at all stark.  Indeed,  the difference  would shrink to the
realm of cases where F-1  and F-2 are both domestic and F-2 actually
decided,  rightly or wrongly, to reject the benefitee's  assertion of res
judicata based on F-i 's judgment. There American law alone opts for
the last-in-time rather than the first-in-time.
That small remaining difference is explainable by the driving
force  of the  American  ardor for res judicata.  It  leads  us  to  apply
preclusion  even  to  determinations  about  res  judicata.  We  give
definitive  credit to F-2's resolution of the res judicata effect of F-i's
judgment,  while  the  rest  of the  world  does  not. Here  lies  the true
difference  between  the  United  States  and  the  rest  of the  world.
Because we accept F-2's decision on res judicata,  we choose last-in-
time as the background rule, and they choose first-in-time.

III.  LIMITING THE RULE FOR FOREIGN-NATION  JUDGMENTS
Say, first, Pierre of France sues Doug of New York in a New
York court for a large installment of interest on a French-made loan,
and he loses by a defense of release of the obligation to pay interest.
So,  second, for all interest that has by then  fallen in arrears,  Pierre
sues  Doug  in  France  and  wins  after  the  French  court  refuses  to
recognize  the  New York judgment  and  finds no release.  Naturally
enough,  third,  Pierre  sues  Doug  in  New  York  upon  the  French
judgment to enforce it where Doug's assets are,  and also sues Doug
upon the underlying claim  for all interest due, but he  encounters  a
fight over recognition. Doug invokes the  first New York judgment.
Pierre  invokes  the  second judgment,  even  though  it  likely  is  not
preclusive under French law on the finding of no-release, 175 to argue
that the later French decision should prevail over the prior New York
judgment.
This hypothetical  emerged during  a classroom  discussion. It
struck me then as a situation where the arguments for the last-in-time
rule  vaporized.  The  second  judgment  being  nonpreclusive  and
foreign  seemed  to  scream  for New  York  to  honor  its  own  prior
judgment. Now to support that intuitive  outcome,  I shall separately
consider how the two features of F-2's judgment-it is nonpreclusive
and it is foreign-together  destroy the rationales for the last-in-time
rule.
A.  Nonpreclusive Judgments
The Pierre v.  Doug hypothetical raises the question  of what
to  do  with  the  last-in-time  judgment  if  it  is  nonpreclusive.  A
conceivable  approach  would  be  to  say  it  "doth  put the  matter at
large," 76 the old expression meaning that no preclusion applies.  The
idea would be  that the  last-in-time  judgment  controls,  and  it  says
there  is  to  be  no  preclusion.  But  no  case  takes  that  approach.
Moreover,  looking to F-2's nonpreclusion would undo the rationale
175.  Because  these  are  different  claims,  and because  French  res judicata
provides little in the way of collateral estoppel, the F-2 judgment would probably
not be issue-preclusive  in F-3  on the claim for interest. FIELD ET AL., supra note

W.T. Clarke, 19th ed. 1832) (1628).42 THE RE VIEW OF LITIGATION [ Vol. 36: 1
for  having  some  priority  rule,  namely,  that  one  of the  preceding
judgments  should  be  the  final  word.  Therefore,  if the  last-in-time
judgment  is  nonpreclusive,  F-3  should  look  to  the  first-in-time
judgment if it would be preclusive.
This  rather obvious qualification  is better handled as part of
the  rule  rather  than  as  an  exception  to  the  rule.  Accordingly,
Professor  Ginsburg  could  begin  her  article  with  this  sentence:
"Under traditional res judicata doctrine,  where  there are  conflicting
judgments and each would be entitled to preclusive effect if it stood
alone, the last in time controls in subsequent litigation."177
Indeed, without a preclusiveness requirement, the last-in-time
rule would be far too broad. Many subsequent determinations  could
be  inconsistent  in  some  sense  and  would  potentially undermine  a
judgment's res judicata effects widely.  Thus, preclusiveness  should
enter  into  inconsistency's  definition.  That  is,  to  be  inconsistent
means that the prior judgments would preclusively resolve the claim
or issue differently in F-3.  If F-I or F-2 does not yield preclusion on
the  claim or issue, there is no inconsistency,  and hence the  last-in-
time rule does not come into play. For example, a decision that did
not get reduced to a judgment would not be considered inconsistent.
Or  a judgment  that  is  not recognizable,  valid,  or final  would  not
come  down  to  F-3.  Likewise,  a  decision  in  a  forum  with  a  res
judicata  law too  narrow to  preclude  the claim  or issue  would  not
come down to F-3.
An  illustration would  be where  Driver  1  sues  Driver  2  for
negligence  and  wins,  establishing  negligence  and  the  absence  of
contributory  negligence.  Passenger  next  sues Drivers  1  and  2  for
negligence  in. the  same accident  and wins,  establishing  negligence
against both.  Then  Driver  1  sues  Driver 2  for contribution  on the
second judgment based on comparative  fault. Even though Driver 2
might be able invoke the second judgment against Driver 1  for some
purposes,178 that judgment did not decide their comparative fault. So,
Driver  1  should be  able  to  invoke  the  first judgment  to  establish
Driver 2's sole fault.179

An  international  example lies  in Ackerman v.  Ackerman.180
First,  the  wife  obtained  a  small  New  York judgment  against  the
husband for failure to pay support. 81  Second,  she  sued the husband
in California upon that judgment and for big amounts subsequently
due,  but  her  attorney  mistakenly  dismissed  that  action  with
prejudice.1 82  Third,  she  sued  in  England  for  those  subsequent
amounts  due,  and  the  court  rejected  the  California judgment  and
awarded her over a million dollars.183  Fourth, she sued back in New
York upon the English judgment,  and the husband removed  to the
Southern  District  of New  York  on  the  basis  of diversity.184  The
husband  argued:  "The  English judgment. . . , not being  that  of a
sister state, is not constitutionally entitled to full faith and credit, nor
to superseding effect under the last-in-time rule."185 The district court
nevertheless applied the  last-in-time rule, observing that the English
court had proceeded impartially,  sensitively,  and soundly. The court
of appeals  ducked that  "knotty  question,"l86  and instead ruled that
New York would look to California res judicata law under which the
California judgment was not preclusive.187  With the California case
off the table, there were no inconsistent judgments and so the English
judgment governed.'88
Ackerman illustrates the important point that while we search
for the proper formal rule, we cannot blind ourselves to legal realism.
Both the district court and the court of appeals wanted to apply the
English result. They differed only in how to manipulate  the rules so
as to get there. The widest route to manipulation is nonpreclusion.  A
court wishing to evade a prior determination would simply identify a
defect  in the  prior judgment's  recognizability,  validity,  finality,  or
bindingness,  which  is  often  doable  thanks  to  those  doctrines'
complicatedness.  So,  where  F-i  faces  a  decision  from  F-2  that
disrespected  F-i's prior judgment,  F-1  might very  well be  able  to
ignore  F-2's  "nonpreclusive"  judgment  without openly  flouting  its
duty to give full faith and credit.'89  This dose of realism thus drives

home  the  significance  of  the  formal  rule's  prerequisite  of
preclusiveness as a path to the desired result.
This subsection's  detour into nonpreclusion  allows us  better
to understand  the  last-in-time rule. The  law in the United States  is
that  the  last judgment  governs-when  two  prior judgments  offer
preclusion of a claim or issue but would preclude differently.190  This
detour  is  also  an  appropriate  introduction  to  foreign-nation
judgments because often the foreign judgment will be nonpreclusive
under the foreign nation's narrow res judicata law, and thus not even
qualify as an inconsistent judgment.
B.  American v. Foreign Judgments
"One of the key problems facing international litigants is the
possibility of irreconcilable judgments or proceedings  arising out of
parallel  litigation."191  How  should  American  law  address  an
inconsistent foreign-nation judgment?
Because  our conflicts  law developed in the interstate setting
rather  than  the  international  setting,  our  law  does  not  show  an
instinctive  wariness  of foreign-nation  judgments.  The  last-in-time
rule  is well-established  enough that American courts  presume  it  to
apply even to international  litigation, at least when two inconsistent
foreign-nation  judgments  arrive  at  an  American  court.192  The

This  provision  says  that  F-3  need  not recognize  a  foreign judgment  if "the
judgment is irreconcilable with another foreign judgment entitled to recognition or
enforcement  under  the  Act.  and  involving  the  same  parties."  The  pertinent
comment explains that the F-3 court "should inquire into the circumstances giving
rise to the inconsistency" and usually should recognize the  F-2 judgment only if
the F-2 court had "considered  the other judgment or proceeding  and declined to
recognize it under standards substantially  comparable to the standards set forth in46 THE RE VIEW OF LITIGATION [ Vol. 36: 1
"Clearly"  serves  the  purpose  of  enhancing  predictability.
"Preferable"  will  turn  most  heavily  on  how  disrespectfully  F-2
considered F-I's judgment.
Accordingly,  the  highly  influential  Uniform  Act  on
recognition  provides  that  a  foreign-nation  judgment  need not be
recognized or enforced  if "the judgment conflicts with another final
and  conclusive  judgment." 97  If  F-3  does  not  recognize  an  F-2
judgment  under the Act, then F-3  would look to the F-I judgment.
This  provision  thus  handles  two  inconsistent  foreign-nation
judgments arriving at an American court.
What  if,  of the  two  inconsistent  judgments,  the  first  is
American  and the  second is  foreign?198  Certainly,  the flexibility of
comity allows F-3 to  disregard the  foreign F-2.  But the inclination
might  still  persist  to  apply  the  last-in-time  rule  presumptively  in
favor  of  the  foreign-nation  judgment.199  I  shall  show  that  the
inclination here is misplaced.
One could indeed argue over whether F-3  must disregard the

mandatoriness  remains  an open one,  but I shall argue in support of
mandatoriness.
As we have seen, the American  Law Institute at first punted
on the application of last-in-time to international litigation.201  Then,
in  the  Restatement  (Third)  of  Foreign  Relations  Law,  the  ALI
expressly adopted the discretionary approach of the Uniform Act,202
thereafter  attracting  some  case  support.203  Now,  in  its  proposed
statute  on  recognition,  the  ALI  has  extended  the  Uniform  Act's
approach, by providing, without case citation and only in a comment
to  its proposed  statute,  that  F-3  must not respect  a  foreign-nation
judgment over an American judgment:
If recognition or enforcement of a foreign judgment is
sought  in  a  court  in  the  United  States  and  the

comment  went  on  to  say:  "If a  later  foreign  judgment  otherwise  entitled  to
recognition in  a court  in the United  States conflicts with  an earlier sister-State
judgment, there is no principle requiring automatic preference for the sister-State

In  other  words,  the  ALI  finally  approved  the  approach
followed  in  the  rest  of the  world's  countries  to  favor  their  own
judgments.  American  courts  would  be  wise  to  get  on  this
bandwagon.  The rest of the countries may know what they are doing
here.  There may even be a value in applying the same rule as other
countries  do  for  local-foreign  inconsistencies,  In  any  event,  the
rationales  for the last-in-time  rule  do not carry over to this setting,
and so the balance of policies tips to a first-in-time rule. If America
were to get on the bandwagon,  we would operate  under the scheme
summarized in the following table:

memorandum, at xviii (AM.  LAW INST. Proposed Final Draft, 2005) (noting that the

American F-2, we should be wary of increasing the  compulsion on
someone,  who  has  won  in  the  United  States,  to  show  up  in  the
foreign-nation  forum.  We  should  also  be  wary  of  compelling
someone, who has shown up abroad, to make what they may view as
a hopeless contention  that the foreign court should give res judicata
effect to  a prior American judgment.  Indeed,  it is  puzzling how to
contend that failure to argue preclusion under foreign law somehow
constitutes waiver of the full faith and credit argument.
Second,  an even more powerful  point is that the preclusion
rationale  drops  out altogether.  If F-2 were within the  full faith  and
credit circle, the binding effect of F-i's judgment would be the same
question whether it is faced  by F-2 or by F-3.  But the res judicata
question faced by a foreign-nation F-2 is a different question (should
it,  under  the  foreign  law,  recognize  the  American  F-i  judgment?)
from the one faced by an American  F-3  (would it, under American
full faith and credit, recognize the American F-1 judgment?).  Thus F-
2's res judicata decision should have little or no preclusive effect in
F-3  (even  making  the  unlikely  assumption  that  a  foreign  nation
would  give  issue  preclusion  to  its  own  determinations  about  res
judicata). Moreover, even if F-2 was wrong under F-2 law in denying
res judicata to F-i's judgment, there was no possibility of getting a
supranational court to correct the denial of preclusion.
Third,  it  is  difficult  to  believe  that  looking  at  the  later
judgment  is somehow  simpler.  If F-3 were  instead to look to F-i's
judgment,  it could avoid the question of recognizability of a foreign-
nation judgment and the task of testing the F-2 judgment's validity,
finality,  and  preclusion  under  foreign  law.  It  should  on  average
reduce  the litigatory  load to  look to the  American judgment  rather
than the foreign-nation judgment.
Fourth,  it is hard to work up enthusiasm  for the proposition
that the  foreign-nation judgment  is, on average,  likely more correct
or otherwise more acceptable than the prior American judgment. The
foreign-nation  court  probably  used  different  choice-of-law  and
substantive doctrines,  and employed procedures that probably would
not appeal to us, to come to an inconsistent decision.  It is not being
parochial to presume that F-1 produced  a decision  as likely reliable
as F-2's.
Fifth,  going  beyond  the  rationales,  independent  arguments
against the last-in-time rule  exist in this context.  Honoring the last-
in-time  would be  an  invitation  to  forum-shopping  among  foreign-
nation courts  by the F-i  loser, who could either  sue abroad on the
claim or seek an injunction  or declaratory judgment of nonliability.
A last-in-time rule would result in "judgment scrubbing," whereby a50 THE REVIEW OF LITIGATION [Vol. 36: 1
compliant foreign-nation  court could erase the effects of a loss in the
United States.205 By contrast, domestic forum-shopping is not such a
concern, because full faith and credit stands as a defense to shopping.
Sixth,  one  purpose  of the  conflict  of laws  doctrine  is  to
enhance  the  coherence  of the  country's  legal  system. 206  In  this
situation of conflicting local and foreign judgments, it is not coherent
to treat the judgments as equals. The suggestion here is not for blind
adherence  to the American judgment.  The suggestion is that a valid
and  final  American  judgment  was  originally  entitled  to  a  certain
respect  in American courts,  and that the intervening  foreign-nation
judgment had no authority to defeat that respect. Nor was the foreign
nation's  decision  on recognition  even  focused  on that  respect.  To
repeat,  the  foreign-nation  court  is  operating  under  a  different
recognition  regime.  The  foreign-nation  judgment was  not deciding
the respect owed in America, but only respect under the foreign law.
In any event, the American F-3 should feel little motivation to honor
the  judgment  of a  foreign  nation  that  has  refused  to  honor  an
American judgment, as they often do.207
Seventh,  there  is  no  case  law  standing  in  the  way  of the
United States adopting a rule of local preference.  A tricky illustration
of the closest precedents lies in Derr v.  Swarek.208
The first judgment in Derr came by voluntary dismissal with
prejudice  of a Mississippi  action by  the purchasers  of Mississippi
farmland  against  the  German  sellers.209  Even  though  under
Mississippi res judicata law the purchasers'  claim was extinguished,
the second judgment came in a suit by the sellers in a German court,
which rejected res judicata to reach the merits of the contract dispute,
granted  the  sellers  a  declaratory  judgment  of  nonliability,  and
assessed nearly $300,000  in court costs against the purchasers.210 For
the  third  action,  the  sellers  resorted  to  the  Southern  District  of
Mississippi to enforce the German judgment for costs. 211
205.  The  allusion  is  to  the  "judgment  laundering"  practice  of getting  a
compliant court to convert a shaky foreign judgment into an unassailable domestic
judgment. CLERMONT, supran ote 23, at 436-37.

The Derr federal district court rejected the German judgment,
and the court of appeals affirmed.  "Because  federal jurisdiction was
invoked by way of diversity of citizenship, we apply Mississippi law
governing  the  recognition  of foreign judgments."212  In the  federal
court  of appeals'  view,  the  German  court's  failure  to  respect  the
purchasers'  dismissal  with  prejudice  of their  claims  against  the
sellers  violated Mississippi public  policy and rendered  meaningless
the right of the purchasers to put an end to litigation of their claims.
"As  the  German  declaratory  judgment  and  attendant  cost  award
issued only because the German court ignored the res judicata effect
of the . . .dismissal with prejudice, the district court did not abuse its
discretion in refusing to extend comity to the judgment."213
The Derr facts  seem  to suggest  a slight  complication.214  in
one  sense, the judgments were consistent, as the purchasers  had lost
in both F-I and F-2.215 But Germany would have decided differently
if it  had  given  the  American judgment  its  claim-preclusive  effect.
How then can we refine the rule to empower Mississippi to look at
Mississippi's prior judgment? We need to include this kind of case-
when  F-3  wants to  look at  F-I's judgment to  knock out  an action
upon  F-2's  judgment-within  the  problem  of  inconsistency.
Inconsistent  judgments  have  to  be  made  to  include  the  situation
where  enforcing  F-2's  judgment  in  F-3  would  defeat  the  claim
preclusive-effect that F-i's judgment would have  under its own res
judicata law.
The Derr federal  courts viewed the denial of recognition to
the German judgment as a discretionary decision under Mississippi's
comity-based  state  law.216  They  could  go  the  Mississippi  way
because  the  case's  facts  of Mississippi  (F-1),  Germany  (F-2),  and
Mississippi (F-3) put it outside the reach of any federal  compulsion.
In  any  event,  because  the  federal  district  court  had  exercised  its

214.  This complication is an additional argument against applying the first-in-
time rule broadly. See supra text accompanying note 36. The last-in-time rule more
simply sidesteps the complication in all but this foreign-nation judgment situation.
See supra text accompanying note 10.
215.  The Pierre v.  Doug hypothetical presents  the same complication.  See
supra text accompanying note 175. The first New York judgment and the French
judgment are not inconsistent in all senses, as the New York judgment technically
could not be used for preclusion in the later action upon the French judgment in F-
3. But the New York judgment should have claim-precluded the French action, and
so F-3 would want to escape the last-in-time rule.
216.  See Derr, 766 F.3d at 442, 446 (noting that Mississippi has not enacted
the Uniform Act, but it follows the usual public-policy exception to comity).52 THE RE VIEW OF LITIGATION [Vol. 36: 1
discretion against the German judgment, the court of appeals did not
have to decide whether the district court was obliged to disregard the
German judgment, under Mississippi or federal law.217
The ALI believes that the general American law should make
mandatory  the  denial  of  recognition  to  the  foreign-nation
judgment.218  In  my  view  too,  based  on  the  reasons  above,  an
American  court  must  disregard  a  foreign-nation  judgment
inconsistent with an American judgment.  Whether the foreign-nation
court just ignored the American judgment, correctly rejected it under
the foreign law, or erroneously denied respect under the foreign law,
the American  court  should look to  the  American judgment.  If the
foreign  country  was  trying  to  respect  the  American judgment  but
erroneously interpreted American law, that is a tougher call on which
there is no case guidance. Because the line between naked disrespect
and  honest  mistake  could be  rather  fine and  because  many  of the
arguments  for letting the local judgment control still apply,  I would
persist in saying the American  court must disregard  such a foreign-
nation  judgment.  If,  however,  the  foreign-nation  court  were,
someday,  to  become  mutually  obligated  by  treaty  to  give  the
equivalent  of full faith  and  credit  to  an  American judgment,  the
balance would tip back to the last-in-time rule.219
The ALI simply attributed  the mandatory preference for the
local judgment to the Full Faith and Credit Clause and Act. I was less
certain that these provisions address this point. No case has squarely
addressed the point, because the court can duck it by disregarding the
foreign judgment "in its discretion" as the Derr courts did. When the
issue  finally arises,  I do  think that an American court  should hold
that  the  preference  is  mandatory,  at  least  as  a  matter  of federal
common law. Although the Uniform Act and some other state laws
leave  the  preference  for  the  local  judgment  discretionary,  the
217.  The  same  issues are  currently  on  appeal  in  the Fourth  Circuit.  The
sequence of cases there was District of Maryland, Iraq, District of Maryland. The
federal cases  were in diversity,  and Maryland is a Uniform Act state.  See Iraq
Middle Mkt. Dev. Found. v. Harmoosh, No. 15-CV-01 124, 2016 WL 1242598, at
*8-9 & n.9 (D. Md. Mar. 30, 2016) (rejecting Iraqi judgment on another ground),
appealfiled, No. 16-1403 (4th Cir. Filed Apr. 11, 2016).
218.  See supra text accompanying note 204.
219.  An argument against constitutionalizing the preference for an American
judgment would be that it might hamper our ability to enter into such treaties. See
generally Kevin M. Clermont, JurisdictionalS alvation and the Hague Treaty, 85
CORNELL L. REv.  89, 124-27 (1999)  (discussing similar constitutional issues in the
context  of jurisdiction).  But  recall  that  U.S.  CONsT.  art.  IV,  ยง  1  authorizes
congressional  exceptions  to full  faith  and  credit.  The  implementing  legislation
could adjust the preference for local judgments.Winter 2017] LIMITING LAST-IN-TIME RULE 53
mandatoriness  of the federal law would override it when that federal
law was applicable interjurisdictionally.  If F-2 is a foreign nation and
F-1 and F-3 are the same U.S.  state, then state law would govern.
Nonetheless,  I ultimately believe that the ALI was right that
mandatoriness flows from the Full Faith and Credit Clause and Act.
The way they work is  to require  that an American  court give  full
faith  and credit  to  an American judgment,  subject  only to  narrow
exceptions  expressly provided  by statute  or by rare  court  decision
based on a national  policy.220  In the  situation  under  consideration,
there is only one prior American judgment,  and no statute or strong
policy  calls  for  an  exception  in  favor  of  a  last-in-time  foreign
judgment, so the Clause and Act impose a first-in-time rule.
CONCLUSION
The  current  American  law  on  inconsistent  judgments
enshrines  the last-in-time  rule, despite  the fact that it is  out of step
with the rest of the world's devotion to a broadly applicable  first-in-
time  rule.  Although  America's  law  is  a  bit  imprecise,  not  even
defining  the  idea  of  "inconsistent"  judgments,  it  shows  lack  of
complete conviction only when the last-in-time judgment loser could
not get review in the U.S.  Supreme Court or when a prior domestic
judgment goes toe-to-toe with a subsequent foreign-nation judgment.
It  is  high  time  to  refine  the  imprecisions  and  to  resolve  the
uncertainties.
To  do so,  this  Article  proposes  the  following  "blackletter"
formulation:221
INCONSISTENT  JUDGMENTS:  When  two  (or
more)  prior judgments would  preclude a claim  or
issue differently in a subsequent action, the last-in-
time of the prior judgments will  be  recognized  as
controlling on the claim or issue.
If, however,  both judgments come  from foreign
nations, the flexibility of comity  means the last-in-
220.  See CLERMONT, supra note 23, at 429-31  (discussing rule of full faith
and credit under "state-state" and "state-federal"  situations).
221.  See Kasia  Solon  Cristobal,  From Law in  Bischletter to  "Blackletter
Law," 108 LAw LIBR. J. 181  (2016) (tracing the history of this phrase's meaning
from the off-putting use in law of very black Gothic type to the concise statement
of the basic principles of a legal subject).54 THE RE VIEW OF LITIGATION [ Vol. 36: 1
time  judgment  need  not  be  recognized  as
controlling in circumstances that make the first-in-
time resolution appear clearly preferable.
Moreover,  in  an  inconsistency  between  an
American  judgment  and  a  foreign-nation
judgment,  including  where  enforcing  the foreign-
nation judgment would  defeat the claim-preclusive
effect  that  the  American  judgment  would  have
under its own  res judicata law,  the foreign-nation
judgment will  not be  recognized  as controlling  on
the claim or issue.
This  formulation  realizes  the  slight advantages  of a last-in-
time  approach,  while  recognizing  needed  exceptions  for  treating
foreign-nation judgments. Additionally, it accords with the American
cases,  intelligently  reread,  a  case  law  position to  which  a goodly
number of Supreme  Court cases  have pretty  much  committed  us.
Finally, given American  law's  current exception  for foreign-nation
judgments, and recalling the incipient acceptance abroad of waiver as
an exception to their first-in-time rule, it turns out that America and
the  rest  of the  world  are  not  so  far  apart  in  the  treatment  of
inconsistent  judgments  after  all.  The  consequential  irony  is  that
comparative law, which prompted my questioning of American law,
ultimately  reveals  convergence  and  so  provides  support  for  the
proposed reformulation.
