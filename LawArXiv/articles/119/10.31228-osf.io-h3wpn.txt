Copyright Provisions in Law Journal Publication Agreements*
Benjamin J. Keele**
Mr. Keele examined copyright provisions of law journal publication agreements and 
found that a minority of journals ask authors to transfer copyright. Most journals also 
permit authors to self-archive articles. He recommends journals make their agree-
ments publicly available and use licenses instead of copyright transfers.
Introduction
¶1 Authors, law journal editors, and librarians should always consider copy-
right law when dealing with scholarly articles. Generally, copyright issues relating 
to an article are handled through a publication agreement between the law journal 
and author. Because journal editors develop agreements, authors negotiate modi-
fications, and law librarians advise and educate about copyright, all three parties 
have an interest in the terms under which articles are published.
¶2 Examining a sample of U.S. law journal publication agreements can provide 
information on the copyright practices used by most journals. With this informa-
tion, editors can make more informed decisions about modifying their agreements, 
authors can more carefully weigh publication terms when choosing publication 
venues, and librarians can help both editors and authors establish a healthy balance 
between journal and author rights. The distribution of copyright privileges can 
also be analyzed to determine the extent to which publication agreements permit, 
or even encourage, open access to legal scholarship. 
Why Publication Agreements Matter
¶3 Publication agreements between journals and authors generally govern each 
party’s ability to use the article covered by the agreement, and are thus an extremely 
important factor in the movement to increase open access to legal scholarship––
making scholarly articles available to the general public online, without charge, and 
with minimal legal restrictions.1 Open access can be achieved either by journals, as 
a matter of policy, making their contents freely available online, or by authors 
archiving their own works in institutional, disciplinary, or personal digital reposi-

tories.2 Because publication agreements bind both the journal’s and the author’s 
use of an article, agreements can either facilitate or hinder open access.
¶4 Open access emerged from the confluence of two trends in scholarly pub-
lishing: increasing prices for journal subscriptions and the growing practice of the 
digital dissemination of scholarship.3 While the cost of subscriptions to law jour-
nals has never been as high as for other academic periodicals,4 contracts between 
law  journals  and  subscription  databases  such  as  Westlaw,  LexisNexis,  and 
HeinOnline have meant that most legal scholarship is available only in databases to 
which the general public does not have access. Law students and professors expect 
articles to be easily accessible online, and the general public can also benefit greatly 
from such access,5 but this benefit is reduced when access to articles is subject to 
subscription fees. Assuming that open access to most law journal articles is desir-
able, do most publication agreements support or inhibit this goal?6 
¶5 One widely publicized example of the ability of publication agreements to 
constrain open access was Dan Hunter’s experience with the California Law Review. 
In 2003, the journal, with which Hunter had signed publication agreements that 
transferred copyright in his articles, ordered drafts of his articles removed from the 
Social Science Research Network (SSRN).7 Hunter lost control of his academic 
work, and the journal, protecting its royalties from subscription databases (a major 
source of funding), had worked against open access to scholarship. After Hunter’s 
protests, the California Law Review changed its copyright policy, further highlight-
ing  the  importance  of  publication  agreements  and  their  effect  on  legal 
scholarship. 
¶6 Just as agreements can give journals or authors control over which drafts of 
articles are made available and how costly access will be, they also determine who 
can have articles translated for readers in other countries, reprinted in anthologies 
or course packets, or migrated into new formats to help maintain long-term digital 
preservation. In sum, through copyright agreements, journals and authors struc-
ture the relationships between themselves, librarians, vendors, and readers for the 
foreseeable future.
Trends Toward Author Rights and Open Access
¶7 In the past, like many academic journals, law journals often required authors 
to transfer all their copyright rights, giving the journals exclusive control over 
articles. Lawrence Solum noted that this exclusive control was an obstacle to open

access, because the transaction costs of obtaining permissions discouraged poten-
tial users.8 In 1998, recognizing that complete copyright transfers granted journals 
more power than was necessary to efficiently publish their content, an Association 
of American Law Schools (AALS) committee produced a model publication agree-
ment.9 The chair of the committee, Marci Hamilton, explained the process behind 
the model agreement by listing four presuppositions of the committee underlying 
the agreement’s provisions: (1) articles should never be works-for-hire, depriving 
scholars of any copyright interest; (2) authors should not publish the same work in 
competing venues within one or two years after first publication; (3) provision 
should be made for disseminating articles to other audiences and in other forms; 
and (4) the educational mission of student-edited law journals’ means their articles 
should be available for noncommercial use.10 
¶8 The AALS agreement leaves copyright with the author and gives the journal 
an exclusive license for one year, after which the license is nonexclusive. Although 
drafted when the open access movement was just beginning to influence the dis-
semination of legal scholarship, the agreement was prescient in providing that 
authors may self-archive online (although it is unclear if third-party sites are under 
the author’s “effective control” as required by the agreement), provided that origi-
nal publication is acknowledged. The agreement also permits educational, non-
commercial reproduction of articles, making it much easier for teachers to legally 
distribute material for class reading.
¶9 In 2005, the Open Access Law Program, a joint venture of Creative Commons 
and Science Commons, issued an Open Access Law Model Publication Agreement.11 
While the AALS agreement emphasizes permitting educational uses, the Open 
Access Law Program’s agreement focuses on self-archiving, explicitly stating that 
posting drafts online does not constitute prior publication and committing the 
journal to giving the author a digital copy of the published article. Creative 
Commons licenses,12 which did not exist at the time the AALS agreement was 
drafted, are included as options for journals to allow and authors to select. The 
Open Access Law Program also developed four principles that journals can publicly 
adopt. The principles call for journals to require no more than a temporary exclu-
sive license, permit authors to use Creative Commons licenses, provide digital cop-
ies of articles to authors for self-archiving, and post their publication agreements 
online. Authors are required to attribute original publication to the journal, unless 
the journal omits this requirement.13

¶10 Authors also have the option of negotiating different copyright provisions 
before signing the publication agreement. The Scholarly Publishing and Academic 
Resources Coalition (SPARC) has developed a publication addendum that (with 
publisher assent) supersedes contrary copyright agreement provisions to ensure 
that authors can self-archive, make derivative works, and reproduce for noncom-
mercial purposes as long as the original publication is credited.14 Some law jour-
nals have accepted the SPARC addendum,15 and several journal editors responding 
to my requests for publication agreements noted that they often negotiate with 
authors on copyright terms. Legal scholars and librarians have become more aware 
of the importance of retaining crucial rights to their articles, and tools have been 
created to help preserve authors’ rights. But how many law journals have embraced 
the trend toward author rights and open access?
¶11 Several authors have examined the extent of law journals’ shift from copy-
right transfers to nonexclusive rights. Richard Danner notes that the popularity of 
SSRN and Berkeley Electronic Press’s repositories indicates that journals “are com-
fortable with a culture that both allows and encourages authors to assume some of 
the responsibility for disseminating their works.”16 This observation comes with a 
caveat, though: “It is difficult to know how many journals actually allow broad self-
posting in their author publication agreements.”17 Carol Parker, in her article on 
self-archiving in open access institutional repositories, claims that as awareness of 
open access increases among authors and editors, “a growing number of law jour-
nal editors are reviewing journal publication agreements to ensure that they do not 
needlessly demand exclusive rights, even for a limited period of time.”18
¶12 A study of law journals’ copyright policies, published before the Danner 
and Parker articles, was not optimistic about open access. In 2004, Hunter surveyed 
the general law reviews of American Bar Association (ABA)-accredited law schools. 
From the sixty-five journals that disclosed their policies on self-archiving, Hunter 
found that thirty had no set policy or went on a case-by-case basis, twenty-six per-
mitted self-archiving in some form, and nine prohibited self-archiving.19 Hunter 
suggests that law journals, especially the top-ranked ones, feared that open access 
archiving would adversely affect their royalties from database providers. Even some 
of the journals that permitted self-archiving imposed conditions, such as embargo 
periods, removal of drafts after publication, or not using the published, definitive 
version.20 On the whole, Hunter writes, “the fact remains that the majority of law 
reviews that responded to the survey do not allow open-access archiving, have yet 
to develop a policy on archiving, or claim to allow archiving but only in a way that 
effectively negates the public benefit of open-access archiving.”21

¶13 A more recent study gives some reason to be optimistic about journal poli-
cies. Plotin examined the copyright policies (often contained in publication agree-
ments) of the top twenty law journals in the ISI Journal Citation Reports. She 
found that “while traditional law reviews may contain copyright restrictions for 
future uses, many have become open-access journals” and that several journals only 
required nonexclusive licenses from authors, thereby permitting authors to self-
archive their articles.22 Perhaps the arguments for open access and authors’ rights 
have more widely influenced law journals since Hunter’s study.
Examination of Publication Agreements
Methodology
¶14 Hunter’s study surveyed the main law journals of every ABA-accredited law 
school. Plotin looked at the copyright and open access policies of the twenty most-
cited journals according to the ISI Journal Citation Reports.23 Following in the vein 
of Coleman’s study of library and information journals,24 my study focused on 
publication agreements. Using the Washington and Lee law journal rankings,25 I 
made a list of the top-200 ranked U.S. law journals, regardless of whether the jour-
nals were general or specialized, student-edited or peer-reviewed.26 In August and 
November 2009, each journal’s web site was examined for a copy of its publication 
agreement. I did not exhaustively search each web site, but checked the two sections 
most likely to contain an agreement: the “About Us” and “Submissions” sections. If 
an agreement was found, I downloaded it and did not contact the journal. If no 
agreement was found, I e-mailed the journal at the address listed on its web site. 
Forty-nine  agreements  were  collected  in August,  and  twenty-nine  more  were 
obtained in November.
¶15 Of the 200 journals, only fourteen (7%) had agreements available on their 
web sites. Seventy-one journals (35.5%) responded to my e-mails with their agree-
ments (some by indicating that their agreements were online in a part of the web 
site I had not seen); seven (3.5%) said their agreements were in the process of being

  26.  My original study was of the top 100 journals; the number was increased to 200 and a second 
round of requests was sent to all journals in order to obtain more responses.274 LAW LIBRARY JOURNAL Vol. 102:2  [2010-15]
revised, and four (2%) declined to provide their agreements, stating that they were 
only given to authors. Two journals indicated that they did not ask authors to sign 
a publication agreement. In the end, after searching journal web sites and e-mailing 
journals, I obtained publication agreements from seventy-eight (39%) of the top 
200 U.S. law journals.
¶16 Of the journals for which I obtained agreements, sixty-six (84.6%) were 
student-edited; the other twelve were peer-reviewed. Forty-two (53.8%) were gen-
eral law journals while thirty-six (46.2%) were specialized. The higher-ranked 
journals were somewhat more represented. Twenty-two (28.2%) journals were in 
the top quarter (ranks 1–50) of the Washington and Lee rankings, twenty-nine 
(37.1%) were ranked 51–100, seventeen (21.7%) were ranked 101–150, and ten 
(12.8%) were ranked 151–200.
¶17 I examined each publication agreement and noted whether it asked for a 
transfer of copyright, an exclusive license, or a nonexclusive license; the term of the 
exclusive license (all copyright transfers and nonexclusive licenses were for the 
duration of copyright); whether self-archiving by the author in SSRN, an institu-
tional repository, or any other web site was permitted; and whether self-archiving 
was limited by an embargo or conditioned on attributing first publication to the 
journal. While some editors indicated that other journals published by the same 
school or publisher used identical publication agreements, I chose to only report 
what I found in agreements I actually examined. A list of the journals I contacted 
and which agreements were included in this study can be found in the appendix.
findings
¶18 The findings regarding what type of license the publication agreements 
request are presented in table 1. Copyright transfer was the least common practice. 
Only seventeen journals (21.9%) asked authors for their copyright. Twenty-six 
journals (33.3%) requested an exclusive license of some sort. Most of the exclusive 
licenses were temporary. Slightly under half (35, or 44.8%) of the publication 
agreements  asked  for  a  nonexclusive  license.  One  journal  took  the  unusual 
approach of giving authors a choice between transferring copyright and merely 
granting a nonexclusive license. Since that agreement would allow an author to 
choose a nonexclusive license, I categorized it as a nonexclusive agreement. This 
sample of agreements suggests that nonexclusive licenses may now be much more 
prevalent than copyright transfers, and somewhat more common than exclusive 
(usually temporary) licenses. Of course, this study had some limitations. The

sample could be biased in that journals willing to disclose or put their publication 
agreements online may also be more likely to require nonexclusive licenses. The 
percentages of each type of license changed only slightly when the twenty-nine 
agreements obtained in November were added to the forty-nine gathered in August, 
indicating that the sample is reasonably representative of the journals willing to 
disclose their agreements. While I strove to be thorough and consistent, I coded the 
agreements myself, so human error in reading the agreements and recording the 
results could have affected the findings.
¶19 In other academic disciplines in which articles are peer-reviewed and pub-
lished in journals managed by corporate publishing conglomerates and university 
presses, copyright transfers are more common.27 Twelve of the agreements I col-
lected were from peer-reviewed journals. These twelve peer-reviewed journals were 
published by eight different publishers: the University of California Press (one jour-
nal), the University of Chicago Press (three), Wiley-Blackwell (two), the American 
Bar Association (ABA) (two), and four law schools that each published one journal. 
The university presses and Wiley-Blackwell required copyright transfers, while the 
ABA and law schools did not. This would seem to support the notion that univer-
sity and corporate presses generally tend to require copyright transfers, but with 
only three such publishers in the sample it would be hasty to draw that conclusion. 
Further comparison of the copyright practices of law school-published journals 
with university and corporate presses would be interesting.
¶20 The sample of agreements indicates that most journals permit self-archiving, 
regardless of peer-review, or even copyright license requested. Seventy-three (93.5%) 
of the copyright agreements specifically authorize self-archiving or provide for non-
exclusive licenses and are silent about self-archiving. The five agreements that did 
not authorize self-archiving specifically reserved electronic publication rights to the 
journal, took exclusive rights and did not grant back self-archiving rights to the 
author or, in the case of one journal, permitted the author to post drafts online, but 
then mandated their removal before final publication of the article.
¶21 Most agreements imposed some sort of condition on self-archiving. By far 
the most common condition was attribution of first publication to the journal. Of 
the seventy-three journals that permitted self-archiving, only four did not have this 
term in their publication agreements. Some journals took further steps to protect 
their brand. In addition to requiring original attribution, some journals asked 
authors to take down pre-publication drafts and replace them with the definitive 
version once it has been published. The motivation behind this policy is presum-
ably to avoid confusion between a rough draft and the cite-checked, edited, defini-
tive version.28 Some journals only permitted the final, published version to be 
  27.  See Elizabeth Gadd, Charles Oppenheim, & Steve Probets, RoMEO Studies 4: An Analysis of 
Journal Publishers’ Copyright Agreements, 16 LeaRned pubL’g 293, 295 (2003).

posting of pre-prints and working papers. If you choose to submit a pre-publication version of your 
accepted paper to a non-commercial, discipline-specific pre-print or working paper archive, however, 
we require that appropriate credit be given to the journal as described above and ask you to remove 
the working paper from the archive after your article is published or replace it with the published 
version.”). 276 LAW LIBRARY JOURNAL Vol. 102:2  [2010-15]
self-archived. This policy contrasts strongly with the self-archiving policies of pub-
lishers in other disciplines, many of whom only allow archiving of preprints (drafts 
before peer review) or postprints (drafts including revisions made in response to 
peer review, but not including the publisher’s final editing and formatting).
¶22 Most journals that asked for more than nonexclusive licenses seemed more 
concerned about competition in print publication than online distribution. Of the 
forty-three agreements that contained copyright transfers or exclusive licenses, 
only eight placed embargoes on self-archiving. Rather, most exclusive licenses bar 
republication in other journals or edited books for a time. This period of exclusiv-
ity is apparently intended to position the journal to collect license fees from com-
mercial publishers of textbooks and periodicals and to prevent the author from 
publishing in another journal immediately after first publication (most of the pub-
lication agreements in the sample required the author to warrant that the article 
had not been previously published). Embargo periods ranged from six months to 
two years, with most journals selecting the middle ground of a one-year embargo.
¶23 It is difficult to quantify the influence of the AALS and Open Access model 
agreements on law journals, because many journals use the model agreements as 
templates and modify them to suit their particular needs. As I read publication 
agreements for this study, I noticed that many provisions bore a strong resem-
blance to their model counterparts, so it is clear that these model agreements have 
had some effect on journals’ copyright policies. Fourteen agreements appeared to 
adopt the AALS agreement with few or no changes. The AALS agreement was 
developed before the Open Access agreement and had the backing of a major legal 
education organization, so it is not surprising that many more journal agreements 
had adopted or borrowed from the AALS model. Only three of the agreements 
examined in this study expressly provided for Creative Commons licenses. While 
nonexclusive licenses would not prevent an author from attaching a Creative 
Commons license, the lack of a specific provision indicates that most journal edi-
tors have not yet considered these licenses common enough to warrant express 
mention in their publication agreements.
¶24 Based on the publication agreements I examined, it appears that journals 
are accepting author rights and moving from copyright transfers to nonexclusive 
licenses or exclusive licenses that are limited in scope and duration. Self-archiving 
has also become widely permitted. The practice of transferring copyright and then 
granting back a nonexclusive license to the author in the same publication agree-
ment seems to have little practical difference from a carefully crafted exclusive or 
nonexclusive license for the journal. On the whole, most journal publication agree-
ments provided for a nonexclusive license (either immediately or after the exclusive 
license expires), and virtually all agreements permitted self-archiving at some 
point, with some conditions. This indicates that journals are becoming more 
accepting of author rights and the green road to open access. However, there is still 
some work to be done.Vol. 102:2  [2010-15] cOPYRIgHt PROVISIONS IN LAW JOURNAL PUBLIcAtION AgReeMeNtS 277
Recommendations
¶25 Publication agreements can have long-lasting consequences for authors, 
journals, libraries, book editors, and readers, so when authors are considering 
which journals to publish in, the terms of publication agreements are a relevant 
factor. The Open Access Law Principles call for journals subscribing to the princi-
ples to post their agreements online if they do not adopt the Open Access Law 
model agreement.29 Unfortunately, most of the agreements in my sample were not 
readily accessible. Only fourteen (17.9%) journals had agreements available on 
their web site in a place where a busy author would have a realistic chance of finding 
them. 
¶26 In terms of access to publication agreements, most discouraging is the 
stance of some journals that their publication agreements should not be fully pub-
lic. Several journals would not share the agreement with me, stating that they show 
them only to committed authors. Several more provided their agreements, but 
asked for assurances that the text would not be published. Such policies are particu-
larly troublesome because most authors submit manuscripts to multiple journals at 
once. They thus may have competing publication offers, and knowing copyright 
terms could be valuable in selecting the best offer. Publication decisions are often 
made very quickly, so even if journal editors send a publication agreement with an 
offer, this may not give authors enough time to make informed decisions.
¶27 Publication agreements often contain provisions not relating to copyright, 
such as descriptions of the production process, author warranties to reduce the 
journal’s liability, and information regarding reprints. It is not clear, though, what 
would make them in any sense proprietary. A journal’s value is largely determined 
by the scholarly quality of its content and the efficient execution of editing and 
production. None of these factors are influenced greatly by the secrecy of publica-
tion agreements, so it is difficult to imagine what competitive edge nondisclosure 
provides. One journal explained to me that it regarded its publication agreement as 
an internal document. But publication agreements directly affect many parties out-
side the staff and are, in many ways, concrete expressions of the journal’s copyright 
policies; thus they should be not regarded as any more internal than their submis-
sion guidelines.
¶28 Publicly posting agreements online would enable authors to place their 
articles in journals that have favorable publication agreements. Librarians and 
authors seeking to archive scholarship could gain useful information about journal 
policies, and journal editors would be able to ascertain if their agreements were 
within the discipline’s norm. To the extent that a certain copyright policy causes a 
competitive disadvantage for a journal, then the journal could adapt by negotiating 
alternative terms with authors or amending its agreement. If authors are to know 
whether they will be able to retain their copyright and librarians are to know what 
works can be self-archived by their faculty, public disclosure of publication agree-
ments is a crucial first step. Several projects collect and present information on 
journal copyright policies online, enabling authors to easily inform themselves 
  29.  Sci. Commons, supra note 13. 278 LAW LIBRARY JOURNAL Vol. 102:2  [2010-15]
about journals with which they may publish.30 Journals should disclose their copy-
right and self-archiving policies to these groups and keep their information current 
and accurate.
¶29 It appears that authors expect certain rights to their articles, regardless of 
whether they transfer copyright. If a journal wants to have the right to publish an 
article in an issue, on its web site, in any database, and control permissions for 
reprinting articles in textbooks and anthologies, while also permitting the author 
to self-archive and reproduce for classroom use and later work (perhaps with some 
conditions), then copyright transfer is unnecessary. Properly worded exclusive or 
nonexclusive licenses can achieve the same objectives while also letting the author 
retain rights that might have been left unaddressed.
¶30 Many journals have successfully adopted nonexclusive or limited exclusive 
licenses to allocate copyright privileges to authors. Journals that request copyright 
transfers should reevaluate whether copyright ownership is necessary to fulfill their 
publishing objectives. Limited embargoes to avoid direct competition clearly aid 
journals’ interests in publishing original scholarship, and requiring original attri-
bution acknowledges journals’ editing contributions and eases citation for the 
reader.
¶31 Requiring authors to archive the definitive version also simplifies citation 
and increases articles’ value to most readers, who want the final version, but it also 
reduces authors’ autonomy over their drafts. Perhaps during editing an author 
decides to remove a section and develop it into another article. She may want to 
leave the draft in SSRN to obtain comments about that section. Or maybe an 
author wishes to leave documentation about her scholarly thought process. The 
popularity of preprint archives should also lead journals to adopt clear policies on 
archiving pre-publication drafts. A journal’s interest in ensuring that the definitive 
version is clearly marked may be served by asking authors to clearly mark archived 
drafts as unpublished instead of requesting their removal.
¶32 These recommendations are not entirely novel,31 but the information 
gained from this examination of journal publication agreements indicates that 
they are well-grounded in journals’ growing experience with open access and 
author rights. Many journals have adopted agreements that keep copyright and 
other valuable rights with authors. Authors can encourage journals with which 
they publish to use nonexclusive or limited exclusive licenses, request modifica-
tions to agreements, or attach addenda. Librarians should continue to educate 
authors about their options and advise editors to use agreements distributing 
rights over legal scholarship that serve all parties, including the general public. 
Based on responses to my inquiries, it appears that for some schools, publication 
agreements for all journals are developed by a central office. In some schools, those

offices were located in the law school library. On the other hand, some journals 
appeared to operate independently from the law school administration or other 
journals. Thus, it is not clear who (law school administrator, librarian, or journal 
editor) is most responsible for setting policies relating to publication agreements. 
The study also shows that many agreements permit self-archiving, so legal scholar-
ship is fertile ground for librarians seeking to harvest articles for institutional and 
disciplinary repositories. 
¶33 Further research would help answer questions such as: How have journal 
copyright policies changed over time? What are the differences between peer-
reviewed and student-edited journals or between journals published by law schools 
instead of academic publishers? How many journals impose embargoes on self-
archiving or require (or prohibit) use of the definitive version instead of drafts? To 
what extent are authors and editors negotiating and modifying agreements? It 
appears copyright agreements are not the primary obstacle to widespread self-
archiving of legal scholarship. If this is so, what obstacles require more attention?280 LAW LIBRARY JOURNAL Vol. 102:2  [2010-15]
