law journals through research and administrative assistance, and many are
taking a greater role in disseminating legal scholarship.4
Both authors and editors of law journal articles—whether student, fac-
ulty, or professional—want legal scholarship to reach appropriate audi-
ences in useful formats. They also want to know how their works are
being used. Before widespread electronic communications, printing the
articles in paper volumes and distributing them to subscribers (mostly
libraries) was the best path. Now with digital publishing technologies,
journals also post their content online and distribute them through legal
research databases. However, most journals hew to the closest digital coun-
terpart to printed paper, the Portable Document Format (PDF) ﬁle. Digital
5 
01 legal scholarship is, for the most part, comprised of black text on a white
2
e  background with footnotes, typeset and paginated for publication in a print
n
u issue.
J
16  To see what is truly possible in scholarly publishing, we can look
8 
0 to science, technology, engineering, and medicine (STEM) journals. They
3:
1 have adopted tools and practices that take better advantage of the ca-
at  pabilities digital communications offer. These practices include publish-
] 
e
el ing in formats other than PDF and using persistent standard identiﬁers,
e
K such as digital object identiﬁers (DOI) for online articles. Legal scholar-
n 
mi ship can implement these ideas with some modiﬁcations and thereby im-
a prove its accessibility and usability, both in the short term and for future

n PUBLISHING BEYOND THE PDF

I
y [ As far as documents go, law review articles have not been very complicated.
b
d  They have plenty of text and footnotes, but compared to scientiﬁc research,
e
d there are few images or tables, much less dynamic simulations or video.
a
o
nl STEM journals have incorporated these more-complex features to display
w
their author’s ﬁndings. Legal scholarship could be enriched through inte-
o
D
grating images, video, and other media if law journals could augment their
publishing capacities.
The key to achieving greater publishing ﬂexibility is to discard the men-
tality that articles need only be PDF ﬁles. Legal scholarship’s use of PDF
as the virtually exclusive format of choice has prevented journals from ex-
perimenting with different media and hindered the exchange of ideas and
4 See Simon Canick, Library Services for the Self-Interested Law School: Enhancing the
VisibilityofFacultyScholarship,105LawLibr.J.175,184(2013).ImprovingLegalScholarlyPublishing 121
research between legal scholarship and other ﬁelds of study. The attitude
that law review articles should be in PDF and closely resemble articles as
they were printed in the past is understandable, in the sense that PDF is
comfortingly familiar and therefore maintains the printed page’s association
with scholarly inquiry and professorial authority. PDF ﬁles can be copied,
searched, and printed, but other formats can do much more. This is not to
suggest that PDF should not be used but rather that it should not be the
primary or exclusive distribution format.
Publishing in HTML and EPUB formats provides greater ﬂexibility for
formatting, more display options for readers, and deeper computer analysis.
This is because PDF is an image-based format. It is very good at present-
5 
01 ing content the same way, regardless of the device displaying it. HTML and
2
e  EPUB, in contrast, are based on markup languages. This means the infor-
n
u mation is marked, or tagged, with directions that tell devices how to display
J
16  the text. In a sense, the information is separated from its presentation so
8 
0 that each reader can decide how the text will be shown. Readers wishing
3:

at  these adjustments. HTML is also more likely to be readable by screen reader

e
K For example, the science journal PLoS ONE, published by the Public

a the HTML version of a PLoS ONE article.5 It looks like an online Web page

e ForreaderspreferringPDForwishingtoprintanarticle,thePDFversion
rsiti of the PLoS ONE article (Figure 3) contains all the information that can be

U reading in print. Some PDF articles in STEM journals are set in two columns

law journals. With persistence, though, editors, librarians, and support staff

v

a journal PDFs have page numbers, but they start at page 1 and often note

numbers. This approach has a couple of advantages. First, the article is
amenable to pinpoint citation regardless of format, and second, a citation to
a paragraph is more precise than one to a page.
Paragraph numbers have been adopted by a few law journals, among
them the Richmond Journal of Law and Technology8 (Figure 7), the early

footnotes including the old URLs are likely to break. Redirects are an option,
but editors are unlikely to be able to maintain multiple layers of redirects
to keep all the URLs functional. Broken links to a journal’s articles hurt the
citing articles and complicate the task of determining where and how often
the journal’s content has been cited. Reducing link rot would strengthen the
law’s scholarly literature.
TheprimarytoolusedbySTEMpublisherstoaddressthisproblemisdig-
ital object identiﬁers (DOIs). DOIs have been established as an International
Standards Organization standard and are often used like URLs. However, a
DOI is assigned to an intellectual object and then matched with a URL for its130 B.J.Keele
current online location with a registry. If an article’s URL changes, the pub-
lisher provides an update to the registry. When a researcher enters a DOI
in a browser URL bar, the DOI is resolved to the current URL. Thus, DOIs
provide a persistent way for publishers to point readers to articles. DOIs
are useful for addressing link rot in citations of scholarly works; for other
types of online resources, other Web archiving services, such as Perma, the
Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine, and WebCite, should be used.
CrossRef is a major DOI registration agency in the scholarly communi-
cationsﬁeld.Membershipfeesarerequired,butacademiclawjournalscould
join through an afﬁliated university press or university library, which may
reduce the cost. The California Digital Library offers a service called EZID
5 
01 for assigning and maintaining DOIs for research products.

e  A DOI is written “10.(publisher preﬁx)/(publisher-assigned identi-
n
u ﬁer).” For example, the DOI 10.2307/1372820 is expressed as a URL
J
16  by adding “doi.org/“ in front, so doi.org/10.2307/1372820 resolves to
8 
0 http://www.jstor.org/stable/1372820. This is a Duke Law Journal article in
13: JSTOR.13 Even if JSTOR changes its Web site or transitions to new owner-
at  ship, if it fulﬁlls its duty and updates the CrossRef registry, that DOI will lead

e
el to that article. Each DOI points to one copy of a work. The same article
e
K is available in Duke’s digital repository, but that DOI will not point to that
n 
mi copy. Also, a DOI may lead to a copy that requires payment or subscription.
a Like a normal URL, a DOI does not distinguish between business models.
nj
Be DOIs can be used like serial numbers for articles such that a citation

Cited-by linking is optional, so any list of citations cannot be known
to be complete. However, it is another useful way to ascertain how legal
scholarship connects to other disciplines, and the citation network would
become stronger if more law journals joined and added their citation data.
There have been a few suggestions that law journals adopt DOIs as
part of their citations and metadata.16 Some law journals that are published

one copy of the article, there may well be more, equally legitimate copies

this is a level of transparency that may not be comfortable for some authors.
