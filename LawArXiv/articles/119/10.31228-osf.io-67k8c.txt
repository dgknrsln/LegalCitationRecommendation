“. . .  [T]HOU  WILT  NOT  TRUST  THE  AIR  WITH  SECRETS.”  —
 SHAKESPEARE, TITUS ANDRONICUS1 
During a 1993 congressional oversight hearing on the integrity of 
telephone networks,2 security researcher  sutomu Shimomura  used a 
“software hack” to turn an analog cellular phone into a scanner that 
enabled all present in the hearing room to hear the live conversations 
of nearby cellular phone users.3 Shimomura had been granted immun-
ity to perform this demonstration under the watchful gaze of a nearby

agent from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (“FBI”).4 The event 
was a practical demonstration of what Subcommittee Chairman Ed 
Markey called “the sinister side of cyberspace.”5 
The demonstration illustrated a significant security vulnerability 
impacting then-widely used analog cellular phone networks: calls 
were not encrypted as they were transmitted over the air and could, 
therefore, be intercepted with readily available equipment,6 such as an 
off-the-shelf radio scanner or a modified cellular phone. 
Although the threat demonstrated by Shimomura was clear, Con-
gress and the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) took no 
steps to mandate improvements in the security of analog cellular 
calls.7 Such a technical fix would have required wireless carriers to 
upgrade their networks to support more secure telephone technology, 
likely at significant cost.8 Instead, Congress outlawed the sale of new 
radio scanners capable of intercepting cellular signals and forced 
scanner manufacturers to add features to their products to prevent 
them from being tuned to frequencies used by analog cell phones.9

This action by Congress, however, did nothing to prevent the potential 
use of millions of existing interception-capable radio scanners already 
in the homes and offices of Americans to intercept telephone calls.10 
In 1997, four years after the FCC enacted congressionally man-
dated regulations banning the sale of scanning equipment capable of 
intercepting cellular signals,11 a couple from Florida recorded a con-
ference call between several senior Republican politicians, including 
then Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich, which they were able to 
intercept because one of the call’s participants was using a cellular 
phone.12 Although the couple did not intend to critique U.S. commu-
nications policy when they turned on their radio scanner, their act was 
high-profile proof that Congress’ response to the analog interception 
threat was not successful.13 What ultimately fixed the analog phone 
interception problem was not further congressional action but, rather, 
the wireless industry’s migration away from easily intercepted analog

12. The participants of the call — who included Republican Majority Leader Dick 
Armey, Republican Whip Tom Delay, New York Congressman Bill Paxon, and Ohio Con-
gressman John Boehner — were discussing an investigation of Gingrich by the Congres-
sional Ethics Committee. The Florida couple gave the recording to the ranking Democratic 
member of the Ethics Committee (and thus the leader of the Gingrich investigation). See

phone technology to digital cellular phones — a decision motivated in 
part by the increase in cellular phone cloning fraud.14 Digital phone 
conversations were, at the time, far less likely to be intercepted be-
cause the necessary equipment was prohibitively expensive and thus 
available to fewer potential snoops.15 
Governments with significant financial resources, however, have 
owned and used cellular phone surveillance equipment for quite some 
time.16 Indeed, for nearly two decades, U.S. federal, state, and local 
law enforcement agencies have employed sophisticated cellular sur-
veillance  equipment  that  exploits  vulnerabilities  in  cellular  net-
works.17 Once only accessible to a few global powers at six-figure 
prices, similar technology is now available to any government — in-
cluding those with a history of spying in the United States — and to 
any other interested buyer from surveillance companies around the 
world, often for as little as a few thousand dollars per device.18 More-
over, hobbyists can now build less advanced but functional intercep-
tion equipment for as little as $100.19 The normal course of economics 
and innovation has destroyed the monopoly a select group of global 
powers once enjoyed over digital cellular surveillance technology, 
rendering surreptitious access to cellular communications as univer-
sally available as it once was in the analog world. Surveillance has, 
once again, become democratized, this time with a much more expan-
sive set of capabilities. 
During congressional testimony in 1997, current FCC Chairman 
Tom Wheeler, then the president of the Cellular Telecommunications 
Industry Association (“C IA”), warned the Committee of this out-
come: “Unless Congress takes a forward-looking approach, history 
will likely repeat itself as digital scanners and decoders, though ex-
pensive now, drop in price in the future.”20 Mr. Wheeler’s prescient 
warning has come true. Although the technology has changed, we are 
                                                                                                                  
14. Cell phone cloning is a process by which one phone’s unique account number can be 
captured and programmed into another phone for purposes of billing one phone’s calls to 
another phone. See Jeri Clausing, Congress Moving Quickly To Try To Curb Cell Phone

rapidly approaching a future of widespread interception that feels like 
the past, but with a much larger range of public and private actors 
with more diverse motives for snooping. Whoever employs this tech-
nology can obtain direct, unmediated access to information about and 
from a cellular phone without any aid from a wireless provider.21 In 
some cases, this technology can even intercept the contents of cellular 
phone calls, text messages, and other communications data transmit-
ted to and from the phone.22 
In this Article, we will argue that policymakers did not learn the 
right lesson from the analog cellular interception vulnerabilities of the 
90s: That is, the communications of Americans will only be secured 
through the use of privacy-enhancing technologies like encryption, 
not with regulations prohibiting the use or sale of surveillance tech-
nology. 
Nearly two decades after Congress passed legislation to protect 
analog phones from interception by radio scanners,23 the American 
public is poised, quite unknowingly, at the threshold of a new era of 
communications interception that will be unprecedented in its perva-
siveness  and  variety.  Foreign  governments,  criminals,  the  tabloid 
press, and curious individuals with innumerable private motives can 
now leverage longstanding security vulnerabilities in our domestic 
cellular communications networks that were previously only exploita-
ble by a few global powers. 
In spite of the security threat posed by foreign government and 
criminal use of cellular surveillance technology, U.S. government 
agencies continue to treat practically everything about the technology 
as a closely guarded “source and method,” shrouding the technical 
capabilities, limitations, and even the name of the equipment they use 
from public disclosure.24 The source and method argument is invoked 
to protect law enforcement agencies’ own use of cellular surveillance 
technology by preventing criminal suspects from learning how to 
evade monitoring and detection.25 This secrecy is of questionable effi-
cacy for that purpose, however, and it comes at a high collateral cost: 
For twenty years, the American public has been kept in the dark about

cellular network vulnerabilities and is thus generally unaware of the 
need to secure their private communications. Indeed, even though 
cybersecurity threats are a top congressional priority, it is only over 
the past year that a few policymakers have publicly acknowledged the 
exploitable vulnerabilities latent in our cellular networks, largely due 
to efforts by the press, privacy advocates, and researchers. Moreover, 
to date, there has been no corresponding serious policy debate about 
how to secure private communications from those threats. 
If the United States and its close allies had a monopoly over this 
technology, the law enforcement community could credibly argue that 
certain national security interests furthered by the use of the technolo-
gy — and thus the need to maintain the secrecy of all related infor-
mation — trump the need to inform the American public about the 
vulnerability of cellular communications. This Article, however, dis-
pels the myth that this technology is, in fact, secret at all. Indeed, it 
has been the subject of front page stories in leading newspapers,26 has 
been featured in Hollywood movies27 and television dramas,28 and, 
more ominously, can be purchased over the Internet29 from one of 
many non-U.S. based surveillance technology vendors or even built at 
home by hobbyists.30 We therefore argue that the risks to the Ameri-
can public arising from the U.S. government’s continued suppression 
of public discussion about vulnerabilities in our cellular communica-
tions networks that can be exploited to perform unmediated surveil-
lance outweigh the now-illusory benefits of attempting to keep details 
of the technology secret. Congress should address these network vul-
nerabilities and the direct surveillance techniques they enable, as well 
as the necessity for responsive privacy-enhancing technologies like 
strong encryption,31 as part of the larger cybersecurity debate, to

equipment to exploit the vulnerabilities in phone networks, putting the

argues that the public is paying a high price for the U.S. government’s 
perpetuation of a fictional secrecy surrounding cell phone surveillance 
technology. Specifically, such fictional claims of secrecy prevent pol-

II. AN INTRODUCTION TO CELL PHONE SURVEILLANCE 
TECHNOLOGY 
Because cellular telephones send signals through the air, cellular 
communications are inherently vulnerable to interception by many 
more parties than communications carried over a copper wire or fiber 
optic cable into a home or business.32 This increased exposure to in-
terception exists because anyone wishing to tap a traditional wireline 
telephone  call  must  physically  access  the  network  infrastructure 
transporting that call — such as by attaching interception equipment 
to the telephone wires outside the home of the target or at the tele-
phone company’s central office.33 In contrast, intercepting a cellular

the target, such as at a call-switching center. Today, telephone carriers have modern inter-

telephone call only requires sufficient geographic proximity to the 
handset of one of the callers and the right kind of wireless interception 
equipment. 
Cellular telephone calls can, of course, be intercepted by govern-
ment agencies with the assistance of the wireless carriers via govern-
ment-mandated interception capabilities these companies have built 
into their networks.34 In fact, the vast majority of surveillance per-
formed by law enforcement agencies in the United States is, almost 
certainly, carrier-assisted surveillance.35 But cellular phone transmis-
sions  can  also  be  captured  without  the  assistance,  or  even  the 
knowledge, of the carriers. The unmediated nature of this kind of in-
terception, combined with the growing ease of access to cellular sur-
veillance technology, makes the universe of private parties that can 
intercept a cellular call inestimably larger, and the range of their mo-
tives correspondingly broader, than the pool of potential law enforce-
ment and national security actors who have both the legal capacity 
and technical capability to initiate a traditional wiretap of a wireline 
phone. 
The technologies that enable the direct interception of cellular 
phone calls without the assistance of a wireless carrier generally fall 
into two categories: passive and active.36 The former merely inter-
cepts the signals sent between nearby phones and the wireless provid-
er’s network, while the latter transmits data to, and directly interacts 
with, the cellular phones under surveillance.  
Passive interception technology functions in two stages. First, the 
signals exchanged between a cellular phone and the wireless carrier’s 
network are intercepted as they are transmitted over the air. This pro-

cess does not disrupt the signals in transit. Second, once intercepted, if 
the communications are encrypted, they must be decrypted for analy-
sis.37 Not all communications are encrypted in transmission but, if 
they are, the ease of decryption varies based on the strength of the 
encryption algorithm chosen by the wireless carrier.38 As described in 
greater detail in Part V of this Article, the major Global System for 
Mobile communications (“GSM”) network operators in the U.S., such 
as AT&T and T-Mobile, still use extremely weak encryption algo-
rithms for their older, second generation (“2G”) networks which can 
be easily deciphered with widely available software or purpose-built 
hardware.39 Moreover, although the competing code division multiple 
access (“CDMA”) cellular networks (operated by Verizon and Sprint) 
use different, incompatible cellular technology and encryption algo-
rithms, surveillance companies offer products capable of intercepting 
and tracking CDMA phones too.40 
                                                                                                                  
37. Encrypted cellular communications must be decrypted before they can be listened to. 
In some countries, like India, encryption between phones and the network base stations is 
disabled. In India, this is a result of legislation prohibiting the use of encryption, likely 
intended to make interception by the government easier. See Nehaluddin Ahmad, Re-
strictions on Cryptography in India — A Case Study of Encryption and Privacy, 25

no encryption . . . .”). In the United States, there is no law requiring wireless carriers to use 
encryption to protect calls. The choice is left entirely up to the carriers, which do use en-
cryption in some cases, but not always. See infra Part V.B.3. 
38. A number of encryption algorithms are supported by modern cellular telephone sys-
tems, but the specific algorithm used to encrypt communications between a telephone and 
the carriers’ network is chosen by the wireless carrier. In the United States, the A5/1 algo-
rithm and A5/0 (the “NULL” encryption option) are still used by major GSM carriers, such 
as AT&T and T-Mobile, for their 2G networks. See infra Part V. The major CDMA carriers, 
Sprint and Verizon, use different encryption algorithms for their 2G and 3G networks. The 
Long  erm Evolution (“L E”) 4G cellular standard, which is the next generation technolo-
gy adopted by all U.S. carriers, includes support for encryption algorithms that are much 
stronger. However, as with prior generations of cellular technology, wireless carriers can 
still choose to not use any encryption (the NULL option) with LTE. See VERIZON, THE

Active surveillance, performed with a device known as an Inter-
national Mobile Subscriber Identity (“IMSI”) catcher or cell site sim-
ulator, works by impersonating a wireless base transceiver station 
(“B S”) — the carrier-owned equipment installed at a cell tower to 
which cellular phones connect — and tricking the target’s phone into 
connecting to it.41 For some surveillance capabilities, such as inter-
cepting communications content, the IMSI catcher can also imperson-
ate  the  carrier’s  network  infrastructure,  such  that  calls  and  text 
messages are transmitted through the IMSI catcher, once again with-
out disrupting the communication and thus remaining imperceptible to 
the target.42 Depending on the particular features of the surveillance 
device and how they are configured by the operator, IMSI catchers

Cellular surveillance technology, by its very nature, tends to be 
invasive and over-broad in its collection of data.47 Active surveillance 
devices send signals,  often indiscriminately, through the walls of 
homes,48 vehicles, purses, and pockets in order to probe and identify 
the phones located inside.49 Both active and passive devices also pick 
up the signals of other phones used by innocent third parties, particu-
larly when government agencies using them do not know the exact 
location of their target and thus must drive through cities and neigh-
borhoods while deploying cellular surveillance equipment in order to 
locate her.50 
Both passive and active telephone surveillance technologies ex-
ploit security flaws in cellular telephones. Passive devices exploit the 
weak or, in some cases, lack of any encryption used to protect calls, 
text messages, and data transmitted between phones and the wireless 
carriers’ base stations. Active surveillance devices, on the other hand, 
exploit  the  lack  of  authentication  of  the  base  station  by  cellular 
phones.51 As a result, phones have no way to differentiate between a 
legitimate base station owned or operated by the target’s wireless car-
rier and a rogue device impersonating a carrier’s base station.52

Passive wireless surveillance devices do not transmit any sig-
nals.53 These devices are thus far more covert in operation — indeed 
effectively invisible54 — but they can only detect signals of nearby 
phones when those phones are actually transmitting data.55 Active 
surveillance devices have the disadvantage of being relatively less 
covert because they produce telltale signals that are detectable using 
sophisticated, counter-surveillance equipment,56 but their correspond-
ing advantage is that they can rapidly identify and locate all nearby 
phones that are turned on, even if they are not transmitting any data.57 
A. An Approximate History of Cellular Phone Surveillance 
Technology58 
Rohde & Schwarz, a German manufacturer of radio equipment, is 
generally believed to have created the first purpose-built active device 
capable of performing surveillance on cellular telephones.59 Their first 
model, introduced in 1996, identified nearby wireless telephones by 
                                                                                                                  
signals are first jammed. See Matthew Green, On Cellular Encryption, A FEW THOUGHTS 
ON CRYPTOGRAPHIC ENGINEERING (May 14, 2013), http://blog.cryptographyengineering. 
com/2013/05/a-few-thoughts-on-cellular-encryption.html  (“ he  biggest . . .  concern  for 
3G/L E is that you may not be using it. Most phones are programmed to gracefully ‘fail 
over’ to GSM when a 3G/4G connection seems unavailable. Active attackers exploit this 
feature to implement a rollback attack — jamming 3G/4G connections, and thus re-
activating all of the GSM attacks . . . .”). 
53. See GTReS — GSM Traffic Recording System, ABILITY COMPUTERS & SOFTWARE 
INDUS.  LTD.,  http://www.interceptors.com/intercept-solutions/Passive-GSM-
Interceptor.html (last visited Dec. 18, 2014) (describing product as “a multi-band fully 
passive GSM interception system” which “is completely undetectable”). 
54. See VERINT, supra note 45, at 7 (describing product’s ability to “[o]perate undetected 
leaving no electromagnetic signature”). 
55. Any phone that is connected to a cellular network will regularly transmit data to 
nearby base stations, even if it is not making calls, sending text messages, or using the In-
ternet. Locating a phone that is not currently transmitting data with a passive interception 
device may, however, require waiting some time until the device “checks in” with the cellu-
lar network or otherwise communicates with a nearby base station. 
56. See infra Part IV.C. 
57. See CELLXION LTD., supra note 43. 
58. As telephone interception technology is also used by intelligence agencies and the 
military, it is impossible to tell a totally accurate history of the development of wireless 
telephone interception technology. As with many surveillance technologies, the military and 
intelligence community are the first to use them, and, after time, they trickle down to law 
enforcement. Neither the manufacturers of this equipment nor their many intelligence and 
military clients advertise their use. This portion of our Article is an attempt to paint an ap-
proximate picture, but it is likely that there are many aspects to this story that are missing, 
due to the fact that they remain classified. 
59. The earliest public document describing IMSI catchers and the Rohde & Schwarz 
products is an article in 1997 by Dirk Fox, a German security consultant. See Dirk Fox, 
IMSI-Catcher, 21 DATENSCHUTZ UND DATENSICHERHEIT 539, 539 (1997), available at 
http://www.secorvo.de/publikationen/imsi-catcher-fox-1997.pdf. Five years later, Fox pub-
lished an updated, more in-depth article about the same technology. See Dirk Fox, Der 
IMSI-Catcher, 26 DATENSCHUTZ UND DATENSICHERHEIT 212, 212 (2002), available at

forcing them to transmit their serial number, or IMSI.60 Within a year, 
the company had introduced a more sophisticated product that could 
also intercept outgoing phone calls.61 
U.S. government agencies have used both active and passive 
forms of cellular telephone surveillance technology since at least the 
early 1990s, if not earlier.62 Military and intelligence agencies were 
early adopters of this technology, with law enforcement agencies 
quickly following their lead.63 Passive devices, often referred to as 
digital analyzers, were used by law enforcement agencies as early as 
1991.64 Active surveillance devices were also used by federal law en-
forcement agencies as early as 1995.65 Initially, U.S. agencies used 
devices that were “general use” cell site simulators, which wireless 
carrier technicians operated to test cellular phones.66 Later, cellular 
equipment manufacturers created and sold cell site simulators specifi-
cally designed for government surveillance. 
Infamous computer hacker Kevin Mitnick was located in 1995 by 
FBI agents using a combination of an active cell site simulator and a 
passive TriggerFish, a digital analyzer manufactured by the Harris 
Corporation.67  The  active  cell  site  simulator  was  able  to  page 
Mitnick’s phone without causing an audible ring,68 after which the 
passive TriggerFish was used to locate the phone.69 
By 2003, Harris had introduced its more sophisticated StingRay 
product,70  which  performed  active  surveillance  of  digital  cellular

B. Uses of Direct Surveillance Technology 
Law  enforcement  agencies  perform  most  cellular  surveillance 
with the assistance of telecommunications and Internet companies. 
This method of surveillance uses carrier-owned equipment or tech-
nology that enables surveillance — typically with the aid of dedicated 
electronic  surveillance  and  compliance  teams  employed  by  these 
companies.77 For more than one hundred years, the telephone compa-
nies have provided such assistance.78 While carrier-performed or ena-
bled surveillance is generally the easiest, most efficient, and most 
covert way to intercept communications, it is not the only way.79 
In spite of the user-friendly, often inexpensive surveillance capa-
bilities provided to the government by wireless carriers,80 there are 
certain situations where governments may need or prefer to engage in

police wiretapping,” where “a police officer would simply go to the telephone company and 
request that the phone company assist them with a wiretap,” which allowed the wiretap 
squad to “listen-in on any telephone call in the City of New York.”). 
79. In fact, since the earliest days of the telephone, the police have also directly per-
formed wiretaps. See Meyer Berger, Tapping the Wires, THE NEW YORKER, June 18, 1938,

direct, unmediated surveillance of telephones themselves using an 
active or passive device. These situations include:  
(1) Identifying unknown phones currently used by a known 
target. In situations where a surveillance target is believed to fre-
quently switch phones (for example, by using so-called “burner” dis-
posable phones81), investigators may wish to learn the serial number 
of the phone currently in use, which is necessary in order to initiate a 
carrier-assisted  wiretap82  or  Pen  Register/Trap  and  Trace  device 
(hereinafter Pen/Trap).83 Law enforcement can determine the specific 
phone used by a particular surveillance target by deploying an IMSI 
catcher to collect data about nearby phones at multiple locations, such 
as the target’s home and place of business.  his method ultimately 
narrows the search to only those phones that were present in all of the 
monitored locations.84 
(2) Locating devices that cannot be found by the wireless car-
riers. Federal E-911 regulations require that carriers be able accurate-
ly to determine the location of cellular phones.85 As this technical 
obligation was mandated in the context of E-911,86 it only applies to

(dialogue between two characters) (“ hey make a few calls with a burner, throw it away. Go 
on to the next phone, do the same.  here’s more of those things laying around the streets of 
West Baltimore than empty vials.” “Well, how the fuck you supposed to get a wire up on 
that?”). 
82. See 18 U.S.C. §§ 2511–2520 (2012) (authorizing the interception of wire, oral, or 
electronic communications — including communications content — by law enforcement to 
investigate crimes enumerated in the statute upon satisfying various elements set out in the 
statute). 
83. See 18 U.S.C. §§ 3121–3127 (2012) (authorizing law enforcement to install and use a 
pen register device to “record[] or decode[] [non-content] dialing, routing, addressing, or 
signaling information transmitted by an instrument or facility from which a wire or electron-
ic communication is transmitted” and to install and use a trap and trace device to “capture[] 
the incoming electronic or other impulses which identify the originating number or other 
dialing, routing, addressing, and signaling information reasonably likely to identify the 
source of a wire or electronic communication, provided, however, that such information 
shall not include the contents of any communication . . . .”). 
84. See Complaint at 8 n.1, United States v. Chaparro, No. 12 CR 969, 2014 BL 216188

pr0222_01d.pdf (“[L]aw enforcement officers . . . used a digital analyzer device on three 
occasions in three different locations where Chaparro was observed to determine the IMSI 
associated with any cellular telephone being carried by Chaparro.”); The Wire: Middle 
Ground at 00:18:20 (dialogue between two characters) (“[I]f we know the approximate time 
of [the target’s] call we can start just by pulling calls off that tower, at that time.” “ hat 
could be thousands.” “Yeah, but that’s the baseline, but we get a second hit . . . and that list 
comes down to dozens. And after a third or fourth . . . then we’ve got his number.”). 
85. See 47 C.F.R. § 20.18(h) (2014). 
86. Id. Similarly, although CALEA only required the wireless carriers to turn over infor-
mation about the cell sites used at the beginning and end of a call, supra note 34, federal law 
enforcement agencies subsequently asked the FCC to issue regulations requiring the carriers 
to be able to turn over higher-accuracy location E-911 location information at any time, 
without the knowledge of the subscriber. See FED. COMMC’NS COMM’N, PETITION FOR 
EXPEDITED RULEMAKING, IN THE MATTER OF PETITION FOR EXPEDITED RULEMAKING TO 
ESTABLISH TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS AND STANDARDS PURSUANT TO SECTION 107(B) OF 
 18   Harvard Journal of Law & Technology  [Vol. 28 
 
devices capable of making a telephone call to 911. As such, there is 
no affirmative obligation that wireless carriers be able to accurately 
locate data-only devices, such as tablet computers and mobile data-
cards. When the government wishes to locate data-only devices that 
cannot be precisely located by the wireless carrier,87 it is likely to turn 
to active cellular surveillance.  
(3) Selectively blocking devices or dialed numbers. There are 
situations and environments where public safety officials may use a 
cell site simulator to selectively block the use of particular phones.88 
Some prisons, for example, have installed devices that permit access 
to registered phones, such as those used by guards and other staff, 
while blocking all unregistered phones, such as those smuggled into 
the facility, from making or receiving calls.89 Law enforcement agen-
cies may also, during high-security events like a hostage situation or a 
bomb threat, seek to redirect outgoing numbers dialed by particular 
phones or block incoming calls to all nearby phones. 
(4) Foreign intelligence and military operations. Although U.S. 
government agencies can compel surveillance assistance from U.S. 
wireless carriers, this power does not extend to telephone companies 
in foreign countries. Moreover, even if some level of assistance is 
available from foreign governments, U.S. agencies may wish to keep 
their foreign surveillance activities covert, such as when the surveil-

available  at  http://askcalea.fbi.gov/lef/docs/20070823_JSTD025-BDeficiencyPetition 
Wappendices.pdf (stating that since the carriers now have E-911 mandated high-quality 
location data, they should be required to deliver it to law enforcement). The FCC never 
acted on this petition, but, perhaps under pressure from law enforcement, many major wire-
less carriers now provide law enforcement real-time E-911 GPS level accuracy location 
data. See Soghoian, supra note 80 (describing the real-time GPS tracking surveillance tools 
offered by several wireless carriers). 
87. The FCC gave wireless carriers the choice of using handset-based or network-based 
technology to comply with the E-911 mandate. See FED. COMMC’NS COMM’N, THIRD 
REPORT AND ORDER, NO. 99-245, IN THE MATTER OF REVISION OF THE COMMISSION’S 
RULES TO ENSURE COMPATIBILITY WITH ENHANCED 911 EMERGENCY CALLING SYSTEMS 
(1999), available at http://transition.fcc.gov/Bureaus/Wireless/Orders/1999/fcc99245.pdf. 
The handset-based solution involves the installation in telephone handsets of GPS chips that 
can be remotely queried. In contrast, the network-based solution requires the installation of 
specialized technology at the carriers’ base stations, which can then locate any device con-
nected to the carrier’s network, including data-cards and tablet computers. As such, carriers 
such as AT&T and T-Mobile, which have deployed network-based E-911 technology, are 
able to locate data-devices, while Verizon and Sprint, which deployed handset-based E-911 
technology, cannot. See id. 
88. See Miko Memorandum, supra note 44 (“ he KingFish Dual-Mode System . . . is

lance is aimed at a particular foreign government and its political 
leaders.90 As a result, when conducting surveillance abroad — and in 
some  cases,  even  domestically91 —  direct  surveillance  technology 
may be the most effective surveillance (or even the only) tool availa-
ble to U.S. intelligence agencies and military units for intercepting 
certain communications or tracking particular phones.92 The same 
logic, of course, applies to foreign governments conducting espionage 
in the United States.93

U.S. law enforcement agencies have used cellular surveillance 
technology for more than two decades94 and spent tens of millions of 
dollars acquiring these devices at federal, state, and local levels.95

91. When performing surveillance on sophisticated targets with counter-intelligence ex-

embassies in the U.S., intelligence agents are likely to use passive cellular interception 
technology because it is far more difficult to detect. See Matthew M. Aid, Spy Copters,

Notwithstanding this history, there is scant case law addressing its use 
in investigations. Indeed, when compared with traditional, carrier-
assisted cellular phone tracking,96 there is limited case law and public-
ly available internal agency guidance describing: (1) statutory authori-
ties that may permit or preclude law enforcement use and how the 
DOJ interprets such authorities to permit or limit law enforcement use 
(to include any Fourth Amendment constraints); (2) the frequency or 
regularity with which such technology is used by federal, state, and 
local law enforcement; (3) the types of investigations or actual factual 
scenarios where law enforcement agencies have used the technology; 
and (4) any related prosecution-based and policy-driven considera-
tions for the retention of data collected by an IMSI catcher. This Part 
will present and analyze the limited publicly available case law and 
DOJ guidance in an attempt to describe the policies and rules govern-
ing federal law enforcement agencies’ use of this technology. 
A. The 1995 Digital Analyzer Magistrate Opinion97 
Despite their use since at least 1991,98 it was not until 1995 that a 
federal magistrate judge in California published the first decision ana-
lyzing a government application to use a digital analyzer.99 In this 
matter, the government wanted court authorization to use a passive 
surveillance device to “analyze signals emitting from any cellular 
phone used by any one of five named subjects of a criminal investiga-
tion.”100 The agents likely needed to use this technology because they 
did not know the particular phone numbers that the targets were using, 
and thus could not seek surveillance assistance from the targets’ wire-
                                                                                                                  
Purchases included Harris devices such as the StingRay, Amberjack, Kingfish and Gossa-
mer trackers, plus spare parts and classroom instruction.”).

You See Me Now?: Toward Reasonable Standards for Law Enforcement Access to Location 
Data that Congress Could Enact, 27 BERKELEY TECH. L.J. 117 (2012). For information 
about the frequency or regularity with which federal, state, and local law enforcement agen-

less carriers.101 It also appears that the agents wanted to determine 
with whom the targets were communicating, information they could 
obtain in real time by intercepting signals as calls took place.102 
Following what was likely DOJ policy at the time,103 the govern-
ment sought a pen register order authorizing the surveillance. Magis-
trate Judge Edwards denied the government’s application without 
prejudice, explaining that a Pen/Trap court order was not required 
because the Pen/ rap statute limits its application “to a device ‘which 
records or decodes electronic or other impulses which identify the 
numbers dialed or otherwise transmitted on the telephone line to 
which such device is attached.’”104 Judge Edwards noted that, because 
the digital analyzer was not intended to be — and could not be — 
physically attached to the cellular phone, the Pen/Trap statute was not 
applicable to its use.105 
                                                                                                                  
101. The opinion notes that agents could not identify the particular cellular telephones 
they wished to analyze. Id. 
102. Id. Information about whom targets are communicating with is often relevant to 
identifying the scope of the alleged criminal activity to discover the identities of additional 
criminal targets that may not be known to law enforcement. It would not, however, be nec-
essary for the agents to continue to use a digital analyzer to determine the phone numbers 
the target phone was calling and was called by once the target phone was identified through 
its unique identifying number. Rather, agents could subpoena historical telephone toll rec-
ords from the relevant cell phone provider(s) or obtain a Pen/Trap order to collect real-time 
records from the provider(s) reflecting this information. Indeed, once target phones are

Authorizing the Use of a Cellular Telephone Digital Analyzer, 885 F. Supp. at 200.  
105. Id. The court further explained its reasoning: 
 he statutory definition of a “trap and trace device” does 
not include the limitation in the definition of a pen register described 
above, limiting the devices to those that are attached to a telephone 
line. See 18 U.S.C. § 3127(4). Nonetheless, it appears from the con-
struction of related sections of the statutes governing trap and trace 
devices that they include only devices that are attached to a telephone 
line. Specifically, 18 U.S.C. § 3123(b) requires that an order for use 
of both pen registers and trap and trace devices include “the number 
and, if known, physical location of the telephone line to which the pen 
register or trap and trace device is to be attached . . . .” 
This limitation on the proscription against pen registers 
and trap and trace devices to prohibit only devices that are “attached” 
to a telephone line cannot be assumed to be inadvertent. In other stat-
utes relating to interceptions of telephone communications, Congress 
encompassed, generally, any types of interceptions of wire, oral, or 
electronic communications — regardless of whether the intercepting 
device was “attached” to a telephone line. See, e.g., 18 U.S.C. § 2511. 
That Congress did not impose equally comprehensive restrictions on 
lesser interceptions that do not raise 4th Amendment issues, such as 
those made with pen registers and trap and trace devices, is neither 
surprising nor inconsistent. 
In any event, it must be remembered that the prohibition 
against the use of pen registers and trap and trace devices without 
court order is found in a criminal statute. See 18 U.S.C. § 3121(d). 
 22   Harvard Journal of Law & Technology  [Vol. 28 
 
Judge Edwards also found, pursuant to the third party doctrine as 
articulated in Smith v. Maryland,106 that the government’s use of a 
digital analyzer raised no Fourth Amendment concerns.107 The court 
noted that “[n]umbers dialed by a telephone are not the subject of a 
reasonable expectation of privacy” and “[n]o logical distinction is 
seen between telephone numbers called and a party’s own telephone 
number (or [device serial] number), all of which are regularly volun-
tarily exposed and known to others.”108 
Although Judge Edwards ruled that the Pen/Trap statute did not 
regulate the passive surveillance technology the government sought to 
use — that is, it neither authorized nor prohibited its use — he ex-
pressed serious reservations about its use by law enforcement.109 Spe-
cifically, he expressed concern about both the privacy of innocent 
third parties in range of the device and a lack of adequate congres-
sional oversight.110 If the court were to authorize the government’s 
use of a digital analyzer to identify the particular phones used by 
known  targets,  Judge  Edwards  acknowledged  that  such  an  order 
would essentially permit agents to intercept signals emitted from all 
phones in the target’s area.111 Thus, in addition to the unique serial 
numbers identifying the targets’ phones, the digital analyzer would 
also identify the serial numbers of phones used by innocent third par-
ties.112 Judge Edwards recognized that “depending upon the effective 
range of the digital analyzer, telephone numbers and calls made by 
others than the subjects of the investigation could be inadvertently 
intercepted.”113  
                                                                                                                  
Under well-settled principles, the statute should be strictly construed, 
and any ambiguity in its scope must be construed narrowly.

The court also expressed concern that an order, if granted, would 
permit the government to collect data about large numbers of phones 
without any record-keeping or reporting requirements, thus preventing 
effective congressional oversight of the surveillance tool. Specifically, 
the court contrasted the “lack of record production” with the statutory 
reporting requirements in the Pen/ rap statute, such as “the use of 
court orders that identified particular telephones and the investigative 
agency” and “periodic reports to Congress stating the numbers of such 
orders.”114 Noting these differences and others,115 the court found that 
the government’s application “would not insure sufficient accounta-
bility.”116  
Although clearly troubled by the surveillance capabilities of this 
technology, the court could not restrain its use by law enforcement.117 
Moreover, the court’s determination that neither the Fourth Amend-
ment nor the Pen/Trap statute authorized, restricted, or otherwise reg-
ulated law enforcement use of the technology likely reinforced the 
DOJ’s view that it did not need court authorization for use of a digital 
analyzer, even if it advised prosecutors to seek court authorization out 
of an abundance of caution or as a matter of policy.118 The DOJ later 
articulated this position in a 1997 internal document.

A document published by the DOJ in 1997, initially distributed 
nationally to prosecutors119 and later published on the DOJ’s website,

pabilities of passive and active wireless phone surveillance technolo-

elements did not conform to the surveillance technique at issue, the court risked giving: 
(1) a potentially incorrect interpretation of a statute, or worse (2) judicial approval of a 
surveillance technique that Congress appeared neither explicitly to authorize nor prohibit.

policies governing the technology’s use by federal law enforcement 
agents.121 
In this document, the DOJ took the position that, as long as 
(1) law enforcement agents were not intercepting communications 
content and (2) the acquisition of the non-content data did not involve 
the assistance of carriers, “it does not appear that there are constitu-
tional or statutory constraints on the warrantless use of [an active or 
passive surveillance] device . . . .”122 In other words, the DOJ appears 
to have recognized no need for a warrant or other judicial process for 
                                                                                                                  
121. Id. at 13–15. 
122. Id. at 14. Specifically, the DOJ reasoned that  
 itle III’s provisions (18 U.S.C. §§ 2510-2522) would not apply to 
the use of a digital analyzer or a CSS when they are used to capture 
call processing information (MIN, ESN, cell site location, status of 
call, etc.) because they do not intercept the contents of any wire, oral, 
or electronic communication as the term “contents” is defined by Ti-
tle III. Currently, Section 2510(8) states, “‘contents,’ when used with 
respect to any wire, oral, or electronic communication, includes any 
information concerning the substance, purport, or meaning of that in-
formation.” ESNs/MINs and other automatic call processing infor-
mation that are technologically necessary for the service provider to 
process cellular calls are not the types of transmissions Congress in-
cluded within Section 2510(8)’s definition of “contents” when it was 
amended in 1986. [See S. Rep. No. 541 at 13 (1986)].  
Id. (bracketed citation in original). Moreover, the DOJ asserts:  
[ ]here is no “electronic communication” [as defined by 18 U.S.C. 
§ 2510(12)] unless the MIN or ESN is “transmitted in whole or in 
part by a wire, radio, electromagnetic, photo electronic, or photo opti-
cal system that affects interstate or foreign commerce.” A transmis-
sion normally contemplates a sender and a receiver. The ECPA 
legislative history regarding the definition of wire communication 
warns against an improper mechanical reading of the phrase “in 
whole or in part . . . by the aid of wire . . .” and states that the phrase 
“is intended to refer to wire that carries the communication to a sig-
nificant extent from the point of origin to the point of reception, even 
in the same building. It does not refer to wire that is found inside the 
terminal equipment at either end of the communication.” [S. Rep. No. 
99-541, 12.] Thus, it does not appear that MINs and ESNs “forced” 
from the cellular telephone by the CSS or obtained by a digital ana-
lyzer are “electronic communications” within the contemplation of 18 
U.S.C. § 2510(12).  
Id. (bracketed citations in original). The DOJ further excludes collection of cell site in-
formation from a digital analyzer or cell site simulator from Stored Communications Act 
(“SCA”) statutory requirements:  
If cell site information is treated as a subscriber record or other in-
formation rather than a contemporaneous electronic communication 
covered by Title III, then 18 U.S.C. § 2703 (regarding stored elec-
tronic communications) might apply. It should be noted, however, 
that Section 2703 controls disclosures by service providers to Gov-
ernment entities and does not prohibit the Government from obtaining 
such information on its own without involving the service provider. 
Additionally, because CSSs and digital analyzers do not access com-
munications in electronic storage in a facility with electronic commu-
nication service, Section 2703 does not apply.

law enforcement’s use of digital analyzers and cell cite simulators 
when they are only employed to intercept non-content data (including 
location data and real-time numbers sent and received) without the 
assistance of carriers, whether in relation to specific targets or inno-
cent third parties. 
Although concluding that law enforcement use of these direct, 
unmediated surveillance devices did not require any legal process, the 
1997 DOJ Guidance, as a matter of policy, advises that “to the extent 
[cell site simulators] and digital analyzers are used as pen registers or 
trap and trace devices, they should only be used pursuant to a court 
order issued pursuant to these statutes.”123 When law enforcement 
wants to determine in real time the calls made and received by a par-
ticular phone, the government can obtain a court order compelling a 
service provider to install a pen register or trap and trace device.124 
This disclosure of information involving carrier assistance is regulated 
by statute, whereas the digital analyzer and cell site simulator tech-
nology enables government agents to obtain the same information 
directly from cell phones without any statutory process requirement. 
Perhaps in an effort to reconcile this disparity in regulation, arguably 
as early as 1995125 but certainly by 1997, the DOJ advised prosecutors 
and agents to seek Pen/Trap court process when using a digital ana-
lyzer/cell cite simulator as a Pen/Trap device.126 
The 1997 DOJ Guidance also recognized that digital analyzers 
and similar technologies could capture cell site location data (to in-
clude cell cite data for target phones as well as innocent third-party 
phones).127 While the capability to acquire location data directly may 
not have raised significant constitutional or policy-related “red flags” 
to the DOJ in 1994128 or 1997, determining and fixing the proper legal

cy”).

125.  he DOJ sought a Pen/ rap order from Judge Edwards “out of an abundance of cau-
tion.” See supra note 117. 
126. 1997 DOJ GUIDANCE, supra note 113, does not, however, give any similar guidance 
with respect to direct (non-carrier assisted) collection of cell phone location data. In other 
words, it does not advise agents and prosecutors to obtain the same legal process used to 
compel location data from carriers. 
127. Id. at 14. Digital analyzers and cell site simulators “can capture the cell site codes 
identifying the cell location and geographical sub-sector from which the cellular telephone 
is transmitting; the call’s incoming or outgoing status; the telephone numbers dialed (pen 
register order required); and the date, time, and duration of the call.” Id. 
128. In 1994, the Office of Enforcement Operations (“OEO”) opined that “investigators 
did not need to obtain any legal process in order to use cell phone tracking devices so long 
as they did not capture the numbers dialed or other information ‘traditionally’ collected 
using a pen/trap device.” 2005 ELECTRONIC SURVEILLANCE MANUAL, supra note 113, at 
45. Back in 1994, the OEO concluded that the “‘signaling information’ automatically 
transmitted between a cell phone and the provider’s tower does not implicate either the 
Fourth Amendment or the wiretap statute because it does not constitute the ‘contents’ of a 
communication.” Id. Moreover, the 1994 analysis reasoned that “the pen/trap statute did not

C. The 2001 USA PATRIOT Act Amendments to Pen/Trap Statute and 
Guidance in the 2005 Electronic Surveillance Manual 
While the PATRIOT Act is generally not thought of as privacy-
enhancing legislation, it did bring law enforcement use of passive and 
active cellular surveillance technology under some limited degree of 
judicial supervision and congressional oversight through specific def-
initional changes to the Pen/Trap statute. 
Whereas  the  pre-2001 pen  register  definition  only  applied  to 
“numbers dialed or otherwise transmitted,” the PA RIO  Act added 
the term “signaling information.”130  he 2005 edition of the DOJ’s 
Electronic  Surveillance  Manual  explains  that  “‘[s]ignaling  infor-
mation’ is a broader term that encompasses other kinds of non-content 
information used by a communication system to process communica-
tions.”131 Indeed, the DOJ instructed prosecutors that the new pen 
register definition “appears to encompass all of the non-content be-
tween a cell phone and a provider’s tower.”132 
                                                                                                                  
apply to the collection of such information because of the narrow definitions of ‘pen regis-
ter’ and ‘trap and trace device.’” Id.  herefore, “since neither the [C]onstitution nor any 
statute regulated their use, such devices did not require any legal authorization to operate.” 
Id. 
129. See generally Pell & Soghoian, supra note 96 (describing the current congressional 
debates over proper legal standard(s) and analyzing various magistrate opinions requiring 
different legal standards for law enforcement access to location data). 
130. See 18 U.S.C. § 3127(3) (2012) (defining pen register as “a device or process which 
records or decodes dialing, routing, addressing, and signaling information transmitted by an 
instrument or facility from which a wire or electronic communication is transmitted”). 
131. 2005 ELECTRONIC SURVEILLANCE MANUAL, supra note 113, at 45 
132. Id. (emphasis added). Similarly, the definition of “trap and trace” device, which 
originally included only “the originating number of an instrument or device” expanded to 
include “the originating number or other dialing, routing, addressing, and signaling infor-
mation reasonably likely to identify the source of a wire or electronic communication . . . .” 
18 U.S.C. § 3127(4). Like the expanded definition of pen register, the DOJ instructs that the 
new trap and trace definition now “appears to include such information as the transmission 
of a MIN [or other type of unique identifying number], which identifies the source of a 
communication.” 2005 ELECTRONIC SURVEILLANCE MANUAL, supra note 113, at 46. The 
DOJ’s conclusion that Pen/ rap now encompasses all non-content data between a cell 
phone and a cell tower was based, in part, on its analysis of the relevant but “scant” legisla-
tive history which suggested that the new definitions were intended to “apply to all commu-
nications media, instead of focusing solely on traditional telephone calls.” Id. Examining, 
for example, House language referencing “a packet requesting a telnet session — a piece of 
information passing between machines in order to establish a communication session for the 
human user,” the DOJ suggests that the term “provides a close analogy to the information 
passing between a cell phone and a tower in the initial stages of a cell phone call.” Id. at 47. 
Moreover, in contrast to earlier Pen/Trap definitions that referenced the attachment of a 
Pen/Trap device to a phone line, the House Report recognized that Pen/Trap devices 
“could . . . collect information remotely.” Id. 
 No. 1]  Your Secret StingRay’s No Secret Anymore  27 
 
These expanded Pen/Trap definitions had implications for law en-
forcement’s direct collection of mobile device serial numbers, real-
time monitoring of numbers called and received, and acquisition of 
location information. Specifically, post-PATRIOT Act, the DOJ took 
the position that all forms of non-content data collected directly re-
quired prosecutors to obtain a Pen/Trap court order.133  
D. 2012 Cell Site Simulator (“StingRay”) Magistrate Opinion134  
With the passage of the PATRIOT Act in 2001, the DOJ took the 
position that a Pen/Trap order was necessary to authorize law en-
forcement use of direct surveillance technology, like a StingRay, to 
intercept non-content data. It would take more than a decade, howev-
er, for a federal magistrate judge to publish an opinion evaluating an 
                                                                                                                  
It should be noted, however, that the DOJ drew a distinction between standards authoriz-
ing “off air” collection of cell phone location data via digital analyzers and IMSI catchers 
and the collection of these data through compelled disclosures from carriers. Indeed, in 
1994, the CALEA instructed that “any information that may disclose the physical location 
of [a telephone service] subscriber” may not be acquired “solely pursuant to the authority 
for pen registers and trap and trace devices . . . .” 47 U.S.C. § 1002(a)(2) (2012). The DOJ 
opined that, “[b]y its very terms, this prohibition applies only to information collected by a 
provider and not to information collected directly by law enforcement authorities. Thus, 
CALEA does not bar the use of pen/trap orders to authorize the use of cell phone tracking 
devices used to locate targeted cell phones.” 2005 ELECTRONIC SURVEILLANCE MANUAL, 
supra note 113, at 46–47. 
As applied to compelled disclosures of prospective location information from carriers, 
the CALEA dictate meant that the DOJ had to find another authority to pair with or replace 
Pen/Trap authority. Since at least 2005, the DOJ has been advising prosecutors to obtain 
both a Pen/Trap order and an 18 U.S.C. § 2703(d) order (“D Order”). See Pell & Soghoian, 
supra note 96, at 135–37. Moreover, some magistrate judges have required “probable 
cause” search warrants before issuing orders authorizing law enforcement to compel a pro-
vider to track a cell phone in real time. Id. at 137–39. As referenced earlier, the appropriate 
standard(s) for law enforcement-compelled disclosures of historical and prospective location 
data remains an unresolved issue for the courts and Congress. See supra note 96. For pur-
poses of this discussion, however, it is sufficient to note that both a D Order and a “probable 
cause” warrant standard are more stringent than Pen/ rap.  o obtain a Pen/ rap order, the 
government need merely certify that the information sought “is relevant to an ongoing crim-
inal investigation . . . .” 18 U.S.C. § 3122(b)(2) (2012). Such “certification” does not require 
any fact finding by a magistrate judge. See Pell & Soghoian, supra note 97, at 155–56. In 
contrast, to obtain a D Order, the government must assert and a judge must find “specific 
and articulable facts” that the location information sought is “relevant and material to an 
ongoing criminal investigation.” 18 U.S.C. § 2703(d). The requirement for a search warrant 
is even more stringent, as the government must show, and a magistrate must find, that there 
is probable cause to believe that the location information would be “evidence of a crime.” 
See FED. R. CRIM. P. 41(c)(1). Notwithstanding that compelling location data from a carrier 
would require a more stringent standard than that found in the Pen/ rap statute, the DOJ’s 
2005 Guidance took both the legal and policy position that a Pen/Trap order was sufficient 
for direct collection of cell phone location data by law enforcement. 2005 ELECTRONIC 
SURVEILLANCE MANUAL, supra note 113, at 47 (“CALEA does not bar the use of pen/trap 
orders to authorize the use of cell phone tracking devices used to locate targeted cell 
phones.”).

application for law enforcement use of a direct, active surveillance 
device.135 
In 2012, a federal magistrate judge from Texas issued an order 
denying an application submitted by agents from the Drug Enforce-
ment Agency for the use of a StingRay.136 The government sought a 
Pen/ rap order “to detect radio signals emitted from wireless cellular 
telephones  in  the  vicinity  of  the  [Subject]  that  identify  the  tele-
phones . . . . “137 The agents submitted their application pursuant to 18 
U.S.C. §§ 3122(a)(1), 3127(5) (the Pen/Trap statute) and 2703(c)(1) 
(a provision of the Stored Communications Act).138 The government 
informed Magistrate Judge Owsley that the application was “based on 
a standard application model and proposed order approved by the 
[DOJ].”139  
Since the subject was known to law enforcement (whereas the 
subject’s phone was unknown), the agents planned to identify the 
phone by capturing device identification data “at various locations in 
which the [subject’s] [t]elephone [was] reasonably believed to be op-
erating . . . .”140 After reviewing the application, Judge Owsley con-
ducted an ex parte hearing and ultimately denied the government’s 
application.141 Judge Owsley expressed concern that the application 
did not explain adequately either the technology itself, “how many 
distinct surveillance sites [the agents] intend[ed] to use, or how long 
                                                                                                                  
135. One likely reason for this time gap is the default sealing of all pen register applica-
tions and orders with no corresponding requirement that they be unsealed outside of the 
prosecution’s discovery obligations to indicted criminal defendants as part of the criminal 
discovery process. See generally Stephen Wm. Smith, Gagged, Sealed and Delivered: Re-

they intend[ed] to operate the [S]ting[R]ay equipment to gather all 
telephone numbers in the immediate area.”142 Moreover, the court 
noted that no explanation was given, either in writing or verbally, as 
to what would be done with the innocent information collected from 
the phones of uninvolved individuals who just happened to be in the 
area under surveillance.143 Finally, the court expressed concern that 
neither the prosecutor nor the Drug Enforcement Administration agent 
appeared to understand the technology at issue and “seemed to have 
some discomfort in trying to explain it.”144 
Notwithstanding these concerns, the court’s decision to deny the 
application appears to stem from a definitional problem the court 
identified in the Pen/Trap statute that the government did not ade-
quately address during the application or ex parte hearing process. 
While recognizing that the PATRIOT Act broadened the Pen/Trap 
definitions, “amplif[ying] the various types of information that are 
available such as routing and signaling information,”145 Judge Owsley 
interpreted § 3123(b)(1) of the pen register statute as “straightforward 
in that a telephone number or similar identifier is necessary for a pen 
register.”146 Accordingly, the judge found that the language in the 
statute “mandates that this Court have a telephone number or some 
similar identifier before issuing an order authorizing a pen regis-
ter.”147 Because the government did not provide any support to the 
contrary in case law or any other authority suggesting that the statute 
authorized collection of non-content data from unidentified devices, 
the judge denied the application without prejudice.148 
E. The Rigmaiden Federal Prosecution 
In 2011, a decade after the Harris Corporation introduced the 
StingRay,149 the FBI’s use of the device finally surfaced during the 
pre-trial stages of a criminal case.150 The government prosecuted Dan-
iel David Rigmaiden (“Rigmaiden”) for his role in a scheme through 
which he obtained fraudulent tax refunds for hundreds of deceased

persons and other third parties.151 After a lengthy investigation, feder-
al agents located Rigmaiden, in part by tracking the location of “[a 
wireless data-card] connected to a laptop computer” in his apart-
ment.152  he government did not know Rigmaiden’s actual identity 
until agents arrested him.153 Indeed, the government’s only solid lead 
was an IP address associated with the prepaid Verizon data-card that 
Rigmaiden used to transmit fraudulent tax returns to the IRS.154 To 
narrow down the location of the data-card, the government obtained 
historical cell-site records from Verizon. Those records determined 
that the data card’s location was within an approximately one-quarter 
square-mile area. As Verizon did not have the technical capability to 
provide higher-accuracy location information,155 the government used 
a StingRay to locate the data-card, leading the agents to Rigmaiden’s 
apartment.156 
Prior to locating the data-card, the government obtained a search 
warrant pursuant to Fed. R. Crim. P. 41(b) authorizing the use of a 
cell site simulator.157 After his arrest, Rigmaiden filed a motion to 
suppress, arguing that the government had repeatedly violated the 
Fourth Amendment in its efforts to locate him.158 Ultimately, the gov-

counts of wire fraud, aggravated identify theft, mail fraud, and conspiracy to commit these 
offenses. United States v. Rigmaiden, No. CR 08-814-PHX-DGC, 2013 WL 1932800, at *1

A key question to consider is why the government chose to make 
this concession when the DOJ’s 2005 Guidance did not advise that 
digital analyzers and cell site simulators raised any Fourth Amend-
ment issues that would necessitate securing a warrant. Is there a more 
nuanced DOJ position directing or advising prosecutors to obtain a 
warrant when the use of a cell site simulator may reveal the location 
of a device to be inside a home or other protected space?160

to the use of the cell site simulator, some of which were stipulated to by the government, 
including: (1) signals sent by the mobile tracking device to the aircard are signals that would 
not have been sent to the aircard in the normal course of Verizon’s operation of its cell 
towers, (2) the tracking operation was a Fourth Amendment search and seizure, and (3) the 
mobile tracking device located the aircard precisely within Defendant’s apartment. Id. at 14.

Rigmaiden, 844 F. Supp. 2d 982 (D. Ariz. 2012) (No. CR 08-814-PHX-DGC). During 
questioning by the judge, prosecutors explained: 
We generally recommend [the] use [of] a search warrant at 
a point where we think that we’re going to reasonably be interrogat-
ing a device within an area where there’s a reasonable expectation of 
privacy, because we’re — in going into that area where there’s a rea-
sonable expectation of privacy, we want to ensure a neutral and de-
tached magistrate has made a finding of probable cause at that point. 
However, it’s the same type of data that we’re getting in 
both missions, because based upon the transmissions back and forth 
to the cell tower is what we would use to direction-find the cellular 
device. 
With a pen register order, we — because the pen register 
order doesn’t include a finding of probable cause by a magistrate, we 
will generally restrict our use there to where we’re not knowingly go-
ing into an area where there’s a reasonable expectation of priva-
cy . . . . 
. . . . 
. . . . It’s not the nature of the data; it’s the nature of the in-
terest. And the — the nature of the — the legal interests, the Fourth 
Amendment — you know, where you have an expectation of privacy 
is where we would recommend using the search warrant as opposed 
to just a pen register order. 
Id. (statement by Mr. Mazel). Indeed, the prosecutors recognized that Kyllo v. United 
States, 533 U.S. 27, 40 (2001), where the Supreme Court held that “[g]overnment use[] [of] 
a device that is not in general public use, to explore details of the home that would previous-
ly have been unknowable without physical intrusion . . . is a ‘search’ and is presumptively 
unreasonable without a warrant,” would likely apply to the government’s use of a StingRay 
to send a signal though walls of an apartment complex to locate Rigmaiden’s data-card. See 
 32   Harvard Journal of Law & Technology  [Vol. 28 
 
If the DOJ anticipated actual Fourth Amendment issues with its 
use of a cell site simulator to locate Rigmaiden, obtaining a warrant 
was a reasonable, prudent precaution.  he government’s arguendo 
concession, however, is limited to the defendant’s motion to suppress 
in the instant case. In other words, the DOJ did not take the position, 
arguendo or otherwise, that law enforcement use of a StingRay in any 
other criminal investigation would constitute a Fourth Amendment 
search. Moreover, the government seems to shift positions on whether 
it believes the Fourth Amendment was implicated during some part of 
the tracking operation to locate Rigmaiden: At first, it suggested that 
(notwithstanding the arguendo concession) the tracking operation, “as 
a factual matter . . . did not involve a search or seizure under the 
Fourth  Amendment.”161  Later  during  direct  questioning  from  the 
court, however, the government explained that it seeks a warrant 
when a cell site simulator would locate an individual in a protected 
space.162 Ultimately, the 2011 Rigmaiden prosecution provides no 
clarity about the government’s view on when or if the use of a Sting-
Ray requires an agent to obtain a warrant. 
Indeed, in late 2014, the Wall Street Journal revealed that the U.S. 
Marshals Service has equipped airplanes with IMSI catchers, which, 
since 2007, the agency has flown over cities to locate targets.163 The 
IMSI catchers used in these tracking operations interact with and col-
lect data from a vast number of innocent people’s phones.164 Moreo-
ver, such surveillance necessarily involves sending signals through the 
walls of homes and apartment buildings or penetrating briefcases, 
purses, and pockets in order to identify the phones contained within. 
While the Rigmaiden case presented a situation where law enforce-
ment agents canvassed a neighborhood (and thus penetrated with elec-
tronic signals many of the homes within that neighborhood),165 the 
U.S. Marshals’ airplane-assisted surveillance operations involve sur-
veillance on a much larger scale. Indeed, they send signals into huge 
numbers of Fourth Amendment protected spaces — potentially into 
every home, purse, and pocket in a city. Such dragnet surveillance 
operations therefore raise serious legal questions, even if authorized 
by a court.166

 No. 1]  Your Secret StingRay’s No Secret Anymore  33 
 
While it is impossible to discern all elements behind the DOJ’s 
concession in Rigmaiden’s case, one aspect of the rationale emerges 
in the discovery, pre-trial motion practice, and related hearings: The 
government considers cell site simulator technology to be a sensitive 
source and method that it believes will be rendered less effective if its 
capabilities were revealed publicly, as future targets of surveillance 
would learn how to thwart the surveillance method. Accordingly, 
prosecutors appear to have made strategic choices to limit the Sting-
Ray’s exposure in the case, including an effort to protect the device’s 
name.167 In response to certain Rigmaiden discovery requests, for ex-
ample, the government argued that the technology used to locate the 
Defendant’s data-card and the manner in which the technology was 
employed was “sensitive law enforcement information”168 subject to 
the qualified privilege recognized in Roviaro and Van Horn.169 These 
cases essentially hold that the government can shield information 
about sensitive investigative techniques when a court determines that 
such disclosure would not be relevant or helpful to the defense or oth-
erwise “essential to a fair determination of a cause . . . .”170 
Hence, while Rigmaiden filed discovery motions to compel the 
government to disclose more information about the cell site simula-
tor,171 the government’s concession that the tracking operation was a 
Fourth Amendment search presumably foreclosed the relevance of at 
least some details about the StingRay and its use by law enforcement 
(thereby preventing their public disclosure).172 That the government

ed States will concede, for purposes of any forthcoming motion to suppress, that the FBI 
located the aircard within Unit 1122 of the Domocilio Apartments.”). With the “search” 
concession, the defendant is not harmed by any lack of disclosure — Rigmaiden gets to start 
from the position that the government’s actions constituted a Fourth Amendment search and 
seizure and can then make all arguments that flow from that position, while the government 
can protect details that it believes could assist potential targets in evading detection by the 
technology in the future. See United States v. Rigmaiden, No. CR 08-814-PHX-DGC, 2013

seeks to protect its use of cell site simulators as a sensitive source and 
method — to the extent that it will not even acknowledge the name of 
the specific equipment it uses173 — is, however, consistent with a 
larger effort to prevent public disclosure of the technology and its ca-
pabilities. We address that effort next. 
IV. THE GOVERNMENT’S SECRET STRINGRAY 
Based on the recent public disclosure of an affidavit by Agent 
Bradley S. Morrison, the head of the FBI team responsible for the 
agency’s use of StingRay and other cellular tracking technologies, we 
now know that the Rigmaiden prosecutors’ efforts to shield details 
about the StingRay were part of a coordinated effort across federal, 
state, and local agencies to keep law enforcement use of this equip-
ment secret.174 Specifically, Agent Morrison asserts that “disclosure 
of what appears to be innocuous information about the use of cell site 
simulators  would  provide adversaries  with  critical  information . . . 
necessary to develop defensive technology, modify their behaviors, 
and otherwise take countermeasures designed to thwart the use of this 
technology.”175 Agent Morrison warns that disclosure “could result in 
the FBI’s inability to protect the public from terrorism and other crim-
inal activity because, through public disclosures, this technology has 
been rendered essentially useless for future investigations.”176 Similar 
arguments have been made by a number of other local law enforce-
ment agencies across the country.177 
In order to ensure the continued effectiveness of cellular surveil-
lance equipment, the FBI, for the past ten years, has taken significant 
                                                                                                                  
WL 1932800, at *4 (D. Ariz. May 8, 2013) (finding “that Defendant was fully able to make 
his Fourth Amendment arguments in light of the extensive disclosures provided by the 
government, detailed stipulations of fact agreed to by the government, and information 
Defendant was able to obtain through his own investigations” and that “Defendant has been 
placed at no disadvantage by the government’s withholding of sensitive law enforcement 
information”). Moreover, because law enforcement can generally switch to carrier-assisted 
surveillance once a cell site simulator is used to identify a target, it is feasible to exclude the 
use of IMSI catcher technology from the government’s case-in-chief trial evidence. In other 
words, because an IMSI catcher may only be initially necessary to identify or locate a target 
(which may not be relevant proof of the charges at trial), additional tracking of a target, 
when needed, can be performed with carrier-assisted surveillance, which can be used as 
evidence at trial without fear of exposing a sensitive source or method. Indeed, in the 
Rigmaiden prosecution, the court noted that “the government ha[d] never suggested that it 
intend[ed] to present evidence about its location of the aircard [i.e., data-card] at trial.”

steps to prevent the disclosure of information about the specific elec-
tronic equipment and techniques used by law enforcement.178 These 
steps include what might be characterized as a purposeful lack of dis-
closure to magistrate judges when seeking approval to use a cell site 
simulator in a criminal investigation, strict non-disclosure agreements 
with state and local law enforcement, and essentially across-the-board 
refusals to turn over documents relating to cell site simulators in re-
sponse to Freedom of Information Act (“FOIA”) and public records 
requests. This Part describes the growth (one might even say the me-
tastasis) of a discourse of secrecy regarding the StingRay’s use across 
various channels and levels of government. 
A. Lack of Disclosure to the Courts  
Despite the fact that U.S. government agencies have used cellular 
surveillance devices for more than twenty years, the 2012 Judge Ows-
ley opinion is one of only two known published magistrate opinions to 
address law enforcement use of this technology. There are several 
possible reasons for this dearth of judicial analysis,179 but one of the 
most troubling possibilities may be a lack of knowledge on the part of 
magistrate judges about the specific surveillance technique(s) they are 
authorizing, due to a lack of candidly presented explanatory infor-
mation in the government’s applications. In one set of DOJ emails 
obtained by the American Civil Liberties Union (“ACLU”) through a 
Freedom of Information Act request, for example, a federal prosecutor 
in Northern California noted that “many agents are still using [cellular 
surveillance technology with a] pen register application [that] does not 
make [the use of that technology] explicit.”180 Similarly, at a confer-
ence at Yale Law School in 2013, Judge Owsley indicated that federal 
agents may frequently obfuscate the planned use of a StingRay in au-
thorization requests: 
“I may have seen them before and not realized what 
it was, because what they do is present an application 
that  looks  essentially  like  a  pen  register  applica-
tion . . . . So any magistrate judge that is typically 
looking at a lot of pen register applications and not

paying a lot of attention to the details may be signing 
an application that is authorizing a Sting[R]ay.”181 
In Tacoma, Washington, the local police have used StingRay sur-
veillance devices since 2009 and insist that they only do so with ap-
proval from a judge.182 When asked about the police department’s 
statements in 2014, however, the presiding judge of the local Superior 
Court told a reporter that the StingRay equipment had not been men-
tioned in any warrant applications that he has seen. He also revealed 
that other judges in his court were similarly surprised to hear that the 
Tacoma police were using the technology, stating that “[the judges] 
had never heard of it.”183 
That prosecutors have not made this information clear to judges 
often appears to be an intentional action. In the Rigmaiden case, for 
example, prosecutors conceded that the government had not made a 
“full disclosure to the magistrate judge [who issued the original order 
authorizing the surveillance] with respect to the nature and operation 
of the [StingRay] device [used to locate Rigmaiden].”184 The reason 
for that lack of candor, the DOJ later told the court, was “because of 
the sensitive nature of the device in terms of concerns out of the dis-
closure to third parties.”185 
Likewise, two notable events in Florida suggest an intentional ef-
fort by local law enforcement in that state to protect details about the 
use and functions of cellular surveillance technology. In a 2008 state 
case, police in  allahassee used a StingRay to locate a victim’s stolen 
phone in the defendant’s apartment.186 The police later revealed that 
they “did not want to obtain a search warrant because they did not

want to reveal information about the technology they used to track the 
cell phone signal.”187 In addition, an investigator with the technical 
operations unit of the  allahassee Police Department testified: “[W]e 
prefer that alternate legal methods be used, so that we do not have to 
rely upon the equipment to establish probable cause, [in order to 
avoid]  reveal[ing]  the  nature  [of  the  surveillance]  and  methods 
[used].”188  
In Sarasota, police have enacted a policy of describing StingRay-
derived intelligence in depositions and reports as “‘information from a 
confidential source regarding the location of the suspect . . . .’”189 Ac-
cording to emails obtained by the ACLU, this policy, which was re-
quested by the U.S. Marshals, is intended to shield information about 
the StingRay “so that [law enforcement] may continue to utilize this 
technology without the knowledge of the criminal element.”190 Even 
if the aim of this policy is to keep the general public in the dark, by 
including misleading information in court documents, the police are 
also preventing the courts from having a true understanding of the 
electronic surveillance that is being conducted under their watch. 
B. Secrecy via Regulatory Restrictions and Non-Disclosure 
Agreements 
The Harris Corporation, which manufactures the StingRay, has 
submitted to the FCC applications for equipment-authorization licens-
es for each of its cellular-surveillance products.191 These applications 
include language provided by the FBI,192 which requests that the FCC 
impose specific conditions as part of regulatory agency’s authoriza-
tion of Harris’ surveillance equipment:

the proliferation of the equipment to unauthorized users.”194 
The FBI and DOJ are indeed coordinating the use of this technol-

state and local enforcement partners.195 The FBI argues that infor-

Local law enforcement agencies that have purchased Harris cellu-
lar interception technology have also signed non-disclosure agree-
ments  with  the  manufacturer  of  the  equipment.  The  Harris  non-
disclosure agreement, which has been obtained by activists through 
Open Records Act requests,198 specifically prohibits the disclosure of 
any information about the use of the company’s products, including 
operations, missions, and investigative results that would be deemed a 
“release of technical data . . . .”199 
C. Federal FOIA and State Public Records Act Responses 
Over the past few years, privacy advocates and journalists have 
submitted numerous open records requests to federal and state law 
enforcement agencies seeking any documents pertaining to StingRays 
and related surveillance technologies.200 The FBI, DOJ, and Depart-
ment of Homeland Security (“DHS”) have, collectively, located more 
than 24,000 pages of relevant documents, but have either withheld 
them in their entirety or released them in such a heavily redacted form 
that they reveal little to no useful information. 201 
To justify their limited disclosure, the FBI, DOJ, and DHS claim 
a number of FOIA exemptions, including arguments that the produc-
tion  of  documents  would:  (1) reveal  classified  information;

(2) disclose techniques and procedures for law enforcement investiga-

Consistent with the government’s FOIA positions, the prosecutor 
in the Rigmaiden case stated that “the sensitive nature of the equip-
ment [used to locate the defendant] goes beyond issues of law en-
forcement to matters of national security,” as “some of this equipment 
is not only used in the law enforcement realm, it’s used in the national 
security realm.”203 
Local law enforcement agencies have similarly been evasive. In 
response to queries from journalists working with USA Today, thirty-
six police agencies refused to confirm whether or not they have even 
used cellular surveillance equipment.204 Several state and local law 
enforcement agencies have also refused to disclose records related to 
the use of this technology, arguing that “criminals or terrorists could 
use the information to thwart important crime-fighting and surveil-
lance techniques.”205 In sum, these federal and state responses, while 
perhaps lawful responses to FOIA and Public Records Act requests, 
illustrate a much larger secrecy policy and narrative: Law enforce-
ment agencies believe that the existence, capabilities, and limitations 
of this cellular interception technology are secret and that the secrecy 
must persist in order for the technology to continue to be an effective 
law enforcement surveillance tool.206 
V. A SECRET NO MORE 
While  U.S.  government  agencies  shroud  cellular  surveillance 
technology in secrecy, in several other countries this same technology 
is subject to legislative oversight, judicial review, and, thus, public 
discourse. In still other countries, the unregulated nature of this tech-
nology has led to a chaotic situation where thousands of untracked

interception devices are in use, many by non-governmental actors. 
Moreover, skilled hobbyists using readily available off-the-shelf com-
ponents can now build homemade cellular interception devices for a 
tiny fraction of the cost law enforcement and security agencies pay for 
Harris’ StingRay. In detailing the existence of an open, global market 
for cellular interception technology, this Part dispels any rational no-
tion that cellular interception technology is or can be kept secret.  
A. The Globalization of Cellular Interception Technology 
The first generation of cellular interception technology was intro-
duced during the early-1990s.207 Generally, it was expensive and sold 
by a few defense contractors only to major global powers. Today, 
however,  both  passive  and  active  surveillance  devices  are  much 
cheaper and available on the open market from surveillance vendors 
in the Middle East, South America, and Asia.208 The major powers 
thus no longer enjoy a monopoly over cellular phone surveillance. It 
has become, for better or for worse, irreversibly globalized. 
Defense contractors sold the first phone interception devices to 
world powers such as Germany,209 the United Kingdom,210 the United 
States,211 and most likely, Russia and Israel.212 Over the past three 
decades, the market for this technology has steadily expanded and the 
price of the technology has, consequently, dropped.213 Manufacturers

demonstration of the GSM-X interception device to potential government clients in 1999 by 
MMI Research Ltd, a British surveillance equipment manufacturer). 
211. See supra Part II.A. 
212. Given the active, sophisticated espionage efforts of the Russian and Israeli intelli-
gence agencies, it is almost certainly the case that companies in these countries were early 
manufacturers of this technology too. Today, there are many large companies in Israel and 
Russia that actively export cellular surveillance equipment around the world. For Israel, see

deed, cellular interception devices are reportedly among the “bestsel-
ling items” exhibited at surveillance industry trade shows.226 
Although several governments have employed phone interception 
technology, the extent to which it has been used responsibly and dis-
closed to the public varies considerably by country. Germany is per-
haps the most open and transparent country regarding its use of active 
interception technology. The use of such devices by German govern-

mandate, among other things, that statistical data describing their use 
be aggregated and published by the German Parliament.228 Moreover, 
there have been several formal parliamentary answers to questions 
submitted by the public regarding the use of IMSI catchers,229 as well 
as a decision from the German Constitutional Court permitting their 
use.230 
The way cellular interception devices are regulated in Norway is 
also noteworthy because of the degree to which the legislation permit-
ting their use explicitly acknowledges the dragnet nature of the tech-
nology. The relevant law permits temporary mass monitoring of all 
calls in a specific area during which police listen to all phone calls in 
the suspect’s community, regardless of whether the intercepted parties 
have any connection with the case under investigation.231 
It is in India, however, where cell phone interception technology 
has had the most high profile and politically destabilizing impact. Be-
ginning in 2005, agencies in the Indian national government imported 
passive cellular interception systems.232 In 2010, audio recordings and

devices were leaked to the press, leading to a huge scandal.233 Media 
reports revealed that, just two years after the devices were first pur-

the phone calls of senior politicians, including opposition leaders.234 
An anonymous intelligence official told one Indian newspaper 
that cellular interception technology enabled them to “dig into every-
one’s life . . . be it political and corporate leaders, journalists, social 
activists or bureaucrats. We can track anyone we choose.”235 Another 
anonymous official stressed that the principal strategic advantage of 
the technology is that it:

In addition to the high-profile use of the devices against politi-
cians, news reports also reveal that the equipment has been used to 
spy on business leaders, journalists, and families of politicians.237 One 
intelligence official stated that “the [surveillance] machine intercepted

an officer on a salary of [130 dollars] a month has pretty much unre-

A  subsequent  official  investigation  revealed  that  lax  customs 
rules permitted unregulated importation and purchase of the intercep-

forty different makes and models of cellular interception technology 
had been imported from over a dozen vendors.240 The devices had 
been purchased by numerous national governmental agencies, state 
governments,241 and the military.242 Officials estimate that thousands

B. The Democratization of Cellular Interception Technology 
The  effective  monopoly  over  cellular  interception  technology 
long enjoyed by governments was largely due to the cost.247 Devices 
retail for as much as $400,000,248 depending on the features — far too 
expensive for the average person, but a relatively small sum for the 
military, intelligence community, and even many law enforcement 
agencies. Part of the high price reflected the difficulty and significant 
capital investment required to design and manufacture the StingRay’s 
sophisticated radio equipment. As a result, hobbyists and researchers 
without large budgets were simply unable to develop cellular commu-
nications technology. This cost barrier no longer exists. Moreover, a 
set of free software tools has been developed by a community of re-
searchers and hobbyists that has lowered the skill level necessary to 
tinker with cellular communication technology. Consequently, as the 
cost and ease of developing cellular interception technology has de-
clined, the longstanding nation-state monopoly has vanished. Surveil-
lance has become democratized and, correspondingly, the motives for 
surveillance have multiplied. The next elements of this Part will de-
scribe briefly how innovations in radio technology have enabled re-
searchers and hobbyists without large budgets to develop their own 
cellular interception devices.

1. Low Cost Software-Defined Radio-Based Active Interception 
Hobbyists can now build their own active surveillance devices 
with readily available electronic components currently costing ap-
proximately $700.249 The ability to create such low-cost cellular inter-
ception devices is due to technological innovations that have lowered 
both the costs and skill-level necessary to develop radio technology. 
Specifically, a revolution in software-defined radio technology during 
the past decade has eliminated the longstanding technical barriers that 
prevented researchers and hobbyists from being able to experiment 
freely with large swaths of the radio spectrum. Software-defined radi-
os are flexible hardware platforms that, when combined with specific 
software, “can change the frequency range, modulation type or output 
power of a radio device without making changes to hardware compo-
nents.”250 Instead of having to create expensive new microchips (i.e., 
hardware) for each new radio technology — such as GPS navigation, 
Bluetooth, and High Definition TV — a low cost software-defined 
radio, combined with specific software for a particular application, 
can now be used instead. 
The development of software-defined radio has reduced earlier 
barriers of access to radio technology, thus enabling tinkering by re-
searchers of varied skill-levels. This access has allowed developers to 
create, for example, free software capable of operating a cellular net-
work. Indeed, OpenBTS is a popular open source, cellular base station 
software suite,251 which is designed to work with low cost (currently 
around $700) software-defined radios.252 The existence of OpenBTS 
and similar software has thus significantly reduced the cost of creating 
and running a cellular network and brought it within the reach of non-
profit organizations, rural communities, and hobbyists.253

Once hobbyists and researchers were able to build and operate 
their own cellular networks with open source software, it was only a 
matter of time before the software was modified such that it could 
masquerade as a legitimate wireless carrier’s network with the capaci-
ty to intercept calls.254 Indeed, a security researcher did just that in 
2010 — in front of an audience at the DEF CON security confer-
ence — using a laptop running OpenBTS that had been configured to 
masquerade as A & ’s network, thereby allowing the researcher to 
intercept outgoing calls from the phones of audience members.255 Alt-
hough the hardware and software necessary to build an OpenBTS-
based cellular interception device is readily available, doing so still 
takes a significant amount of technical expertise. As is often the case 
with difficult-to-exploit security vulnerabilities, however, the usability 
barriers eventually shrink with the development of easy-to-use soft-
ware.256 Once these usability barriers are removed, low-cost intercep-
tion tools will be available to anyone with a motive or interest in 
listening to the calls of others.257

2. Lower Cost Active Interception with Femtocells 
Technically skilled hobbyists and researchers can create even 
cheaper,  more  organic  active  interception  technology  using  a 
“femtocell,” a device that extends the carrier’s own network. Wireless 
providers have augmented their networks with devices known as mi-
crocells, picocells, and femtocells to provide better cellular service to 
their customers and to fill in “dead spots” where there is poor recep-
tion.258 These small cellular base stations, which customers can install 
in their homes or offices, provide cellular connectivity to nearby 
phones within tens or hundreds of meters.259 Indeed, these devices are 
already widely deployed in the U.S. — Sprint and AT&T each have 
distributed more than 1 million femtocells.260 
From the perspective of a cellular phone, a femtocell is a normal 
cellular base station, indistinguishable from a carrier’s base station 
installed at a cell tower. Because they must be installed in consumers’ 
homes, the devices, unlike traditional cell towers, are small, easy to 
use, and inexpensive. They are typically sold for less than $100261 and 
often given away for free to consumers who complain about poor ser-
vice.262 The femtocell was, therefore, a naturally attractive target for 
security researchers.263 The devices are widely available, affordable,

liver (and intercept) calls, text messages, and data connections. More-
over, the femtocells — like any computer — have security flaws that 
researchers have been able to exploit to gain administrative access. 
Indeed, researchers have then been able to modify the devices, turning 
the femtocells into hundred dollar surveillance devices capable of in-
tercepting communications to and from nearby phones.264 While the 
degree of technical skill necessary to turn a femtocell into an intercep-
tion device is high,265 their low cost and small size makes them an 
ideal choice for a technically sophisticated criminal. 
3. Advances in Passive Interception 
Just as the software-defined radio revolution and the availability 
of open source cellular radio software have lowered the cost of active 
interception, they have also enabled researchers and hobbyists to cre-
ate low-cost, passive interception devices. Such capacity to receive 
the signals transmitted over the air between phones and cellular net-
works should not automatically enable interception of the contents of 
telephone calls. After all, modern cellular networks generally use en-
cryption technologies to protect communications.266 The wireless in-
dustry, however, continues to use insecure encryption algorithms, 
many of which were created behind closed doors, without review by 
independent cryptography experts.267 Moreover, some developers of

personate any operator by utilizing a rogue femtocell as an inexpensive 3G IMSI-Catcher

265. It is possible, and in fact, likely, that sophisticated users will in time automate much 
of the difficult work required to modify the software running on femtocells, thus lowering 
the technical barriers that currently prevent less-sophisticated users from using femtocells to 
intercept calls. Cf. supra note 256. 
266. This is not always the case. See supra note 37 (describing countries where encryp-
tion is not used for voice communications). Moreover, even when voice communications 
are encrypted, text messages may not be. See Magnus Glendrange et al., Decoding GSM

Predictably, cryptography researchers have repeatedly discovered

equipment. Moreover, even after researchers demonstrated that these

271. As Steve Babbage, the Chairman of ETSI SAGE observed in 2007, the cost to the

known to be significantly flawed. See Steve Babbage, An Update from ETSI SAGE,

tion is performed in the base station — and there are an awful lot of base stations in an

One of the most widely used cellular telephone encryption algo-
rithms, A5/1, was created by the wireless industry in 1988.272 A 
weakened version intended for use by non-Western countries, known 
as A5/2, was developed five years later.273 The industry did not pub-
lish these algorithms, but in 1999 they were reverse engineered and 
finally subjected to review by independent security experts.274 A team 
of graduate students broke the weakened,275 “export-grade” A5/2 al-
gorithm in only a few hours after it was published.276 Several months 
later,  a  team  of  cryptographers  discovered  a  critical  flaw  in  the 
stronger A5/1 algorithm, opening the door to practical, real-time de-
cryption of A5/1 protected communications.277 
Even though the cryptography community considered A5/2 bro-
ken in 1999, the cellular industry did not phase out its use until 
2007,278 and then only because new research demonstrated that the

traffic is no more vulnerable to eavesdropping than on a Public Switched Telephone Net-
work (PSTN) telephone line . . . .”  he algorithm apparently passed this low bar, and “all 
members of SAGE stated [prior to the algorithm’s release] that they were satisfied that the

methods used to attack A5/2 could be used to attack the security of 
Western A5/1 networks as well.279 Today, the A5/1 algorithm, created 
in 1988 and thoroughly broken a decade ago, remains the most widely 
deployed cellular encryption algorithm in the world.280 Indeed, wire-
less carriers AT&T and T-Mobile still use the A5/1 algorithm for their 
older “2G” networks in the United States.281  
Information about the strength of the encryption algorithms cho-
sen by carriers, or whether encryption is used at all, is not readily 
made available to consumers, who reasonably might be alarmed to 
learn that the wireless carriers are not using the most secure encryp-
tion available (or in some cases, any at all) to protect their communi-
cations. Indeed, the GSM standard requires that phones be capable of 
displaying a warning when no encryption is in use.282 However, the 
standard also permits wireless carriers to disable the encryption indi-
cator, something that most do.283 Likely due to the fact that it was 
generally disabled and thus not displayed to consumers, many phone 
manufacturers, including some of the largest phone manufacturers 
such as Apple, Samsung, and Huawei, do not support the encryption 
warning feature in their phones.284 As such, there is generally no easy 
way for consumers to determine when their calls are unencrypted or 
only protected with weak encryption algorithms. 
Although the academic research community has long documented 
the flaws in the encryption algorithms used by wireless carriers, these 
                                                                                                                  
279. The primary motivation for the cellular industry to withdraw A5/2 was not concern 
for the privacy of users in countries where the weak A5/2 algorithm was used, but rather, 
because the availability of A5/2 support in handsets threatened the security of phone calls in 
countries where the more-secure A5/1 algorithm was used. See Welte, supra note 278 
(“Since they [sic] key generation for A5/1 and A5/2 is the same, a semi-active downgrade 
attack can be used to retroactively break previously-recorded, encrypted A5/1 calls. The 
only solution to this problem is to remove A5/2 from all equipment, to make sure the down-
grade is not possible anymore.”).

vulnerabilities could only be exploited by those with the resources to 
buy or build interception and decryption equipment. But just as soft-
ware-defined radio technology has lowered the cost of active intercep-
tion, so too has it provided researchers and hobbyists with the means 
to receive cellular signals that can then be deciphered using open

VI. OUR VULNERABLE CELLULAR NETWORKS CAN BE AND 
ARE EXPLOITED BY OTHERS 
The U.S. and other select global powers no longer enjoy a domes-
tic monopoly over the use of cellular interception technology.289 Ac-
cordingly, a much larger number of hostile foreign intelligence ser-
services can and, almost certainly, are using the technology in this 
country for espionage. Similarly, if cellular interception technology is 
not already in use by criminals, the paparazzi, and tech-savvy creepy 
neighbors, it is only a matter of time before they acquire and use it 
too. This Part discusses these current and possible future threats. 
A. Foreign Governments 
Cellular interception technology can be a critical tool in intelli-
gence operations.290 In contrast to law enforcement surveillance, for 
example, where the assistance of a wireless carrier is often available, 
intelligence agencies operating without the knowledge or assistance of 
local governments cannot obtain information from wireless carriers.291 
As such, cellular interception devices are often the only way for intel-
ligence agencies to monitor the communications of targets. 
Indeed, as a result of the disclosures to the media by Edward 
Snowden, it is now clear (and not surprising) that the U.S. National 
Security Agency (“NSA”) uses both active and passive cellular inter-
ception technology.  he NSA’s Special Collection Service reportedly 
uses passive cellular interception devices installed at U.S. embassies 
and consulates around the world to spy on the telephone calls of for-
eign leaders.292 More specifically, an internal NSA surveillance prod-
uct  catalog  describes  active  cellular  interception  devices  that  are 
available for use by agents conducting intelligence operations.293 
Just as U.S. intelligence agencies use cellular interception tech-
nology to perform surveillance in foreign countries, so too do foreign

intelligence agencies operating in Washington D.C.294 In a 2012 book, 
national security reporters Marc Ambinder and D.B. Grady hinted at 
the existence of cellular surveillance activities by foreign govern-
ments, revealing that “[t]he FBI has quietly removed from several 
Washington, D.C.-area cell phone towers, transmitters that fed all data 
to . . . foreign embassies.”295 When asked about the claim by the 
Washington Post, the FBI declined to comment.296 However, a former 
FBI deputy director told Newsweek in the summer of 2014 that “[t]his 
type of technology has been used in the past by foreign intelligence 
agencies here and abroad to target Americans, both [in the] U.S. gov-
ernment and corporations . . . .  here’s no doubt in my mind that 
they’re using it.”297 
As President Obama has noted, “We know that the intelligence 
services of other countries . . . are constantly probing our government 
and private sector networks and accelerating programs to listen to our 
conversations . . . . “ 298 It is for that reason, he added, that “BlackBer-
rys  and  iPhones  are  not  allowed  in  the  White  House  Situation 
Room.”299 The importance of those security rules was proven after a 
team of technical experts revealed in the fall of 2014 that they had 
detected,  with  sophisticated  anti-surveillance  equipment,  tell-tale 
signs of IMSI catchers in eighteen locations in the Washington D.C. 
area, including near the White House, Congress, and several foreign 
embassies.300

intelligence agencies, they are the exception, not the norm.301 It is 
likely that many Members of Congress and their staff do not receive 
special  assistance  or  protection  from  surveillance  in  the  United 
States.302 Similarly, there are many other people who participate, di-
rectly or indirectly, in this country’s policy process — including jour-
nalists,  lawyers,  lobbyists,  researchers,  and  activists —  whose 
communications are intelligence-rich, vulnerable, and likely targeted 
by foreign intelligence agencies. 
Moreover, cellular interception equipment is equally useful for 
non-political espionage conducted by foreign governments. Specifi-
cally, this technology can be used in business centers like New York 
or Silicon Valley for industrial espionage or to gain insider knowledge 
by monitoring the communications of business executives, financiers, 
and entrepreneurs.303 
B. Non-Government Use of Cellular Surveillance Technology 
If cellular interception technology were still prohibitively expen-
sive and exclusively available to governments engaged in foreign and 
domestic surveillance, the communications of the average law-abiding 
American would rarely be targeted.304 After all, intercepting telephone 
calls on U.S. soil will presumably focus their efforts on the tiny per-
centage of Americans whose communications have some significant 
strategic or intelligence value.

304. The strategic targeting practices of foreign governments do not, however, complete-
ly insulate innocent, law-abiding Americans from having their communications monitored 
incidentally by the United States and foreign government agencies. As described in Part II, 
this surveillance technology is by its very nature overbroad in its operation, capturing data 
about many other phones in the vicinity of the area where it is used. 
 58   Harvard Journal of Law & Technology  [Vol. 28 
 
With respect to the average American’s exposure to private com-
munications interception, however, history appears to be repeating 
itself. Just as the radio scanners of the 1990s enabled nearly anyone to 
intercept a neighbor’s analog phone communications, modern cellular 
interception devices are now available for purchase over the Internet 
from surveillance technology resellers around the world for a few 
thousand dollars each.305 Moreover, they are far easier to use than the 
homemade models built by researchers,306 making them an attractive 
tool for criminals, private investigators, and paparazzi.307 
In the Czech Republic, for example, law enforcement and intelli-
gence officials have voiced concerns about the threat posed by cellu-
lar interception technology. In 2012, the head of the Czech Criminal 
Police unit for wiretapping told the national public radio service that 
his team had detected non-police active interception devices in use 
around the country.308 Similarly, the ex-head of the Czech Military 
Intelligence Agency expressed fears about potential widespread avail-
ability and sale of such technology, stating that “if their use will not 
be in any way regulated, and access to these devices will not be in any 
way controlled, then a regular citizen can do absolutely nothing [to 
safeguard their communications].”309 He speculated that the most like-
ly private users of the devices were security firms and rival businesses 
engaged in industrial espionage.310 
In China, cellular interception devices are perhaps more widely 
available than in any other country in the world. In the spring of 2014, 
Chinese police shut down twenty-four different factories manufactur-
ing illegal IMSI catchers.311 These devices are in widespread use by 
criminal gangs, apparently not for surveillance or espionage, but ra-
ther, to send spam and fraudulent text messages that lure unwitting 
victims to phishing sites.312 Specifically, using these devices, fraud-
sters send tens of millions of messages per day to unsuspecting con-
sumers with spoofed origin phone numbers normally used by online

versations of others. The chance of being discovered intercepting calls, however, is extreme-
ly low, even more so when passive surveillance technology is used.

banks and other trusted parties.313 According to one Chinese mobile 
security expert, “It’s very lucrative to have a [fake] tower device right 
now. People will pay big money for it . . . .”314 
While commercial cellular interception technology is, for now, 
probably too expensive for the average stalker or garden variety crim-
inal, the cost of these devices will, like all technology, decrease over 
time.315 At just a few thousand dollars each, however, commercial 
cellular interception devices are already affordable for sophisticated 
domestic or multi-national criminal organizations, companies engag-
ing in industrial espionage, private investigators, and paparazzi. And 
for the technically skilled criminal, no matter the scale of his opera-
tions, cellular surveillance technology is already affordable.316 
Although cellular surveillance devices are not yet in widespread 
private use in the United States,317 they are certainly no longer a se-
cret. To suggest otherwise is to embrace and propagate a fiction; these 
technologies have been globalized and democratized, and the vulnera-
bilities they exploit now threaten the privacy of hundreds of millions 
of Americans who use cellular telephones to communicate. Indeed, 
the use of cellular interception devices in India and the Czech Repub-
lic paints a worrisome picture of the potential threat. Even so, U.S. 
government agencies continue to treat cellular surveillance equipment 
as a closely guarded secret, even protecting the name of the equip-
ment they use.318 As discussed next, the consequence of embracing 
this erroneous, tendentious narrative, which grants surveillance priori-
ty over the security of communication networks, is that the American 
public remains vulnerable to cellular surveillance by a variety of non-
U.S. government actors. 
VII. A HIGH PRICE TO PAY FOR THE FICTION OF SECRECY

munications of the rich and powerful. In response, Congress held 
hearings, the cellular industry weighed in, and, ultimately, the FCC 
promulgated regulations intended to limit the ease with which inter-
ception  technology  could  be  obtained.319  Although  the  approach 
adopted by policy makers and regulators — seeking to prohibit the 
sale of interception equipment, rather than mandating technical solu-
tions capable of securing communications from interception — was 
ineffective, Congress and the FCC at least acknowledged the problem 
and did something to try to address it. 
The Congress of the 1990s held public hearings focused on cellu-
lar interception vulnerabilities;320 the Congress of the 2010s has not. 
The FCC of the 1990s adopted regulations intended to protect cellular 
communications from interception;321 the FCC of the 2010s perpetu-
ates the fiction that cellular interception is a secret capability available 
only to government agencies by shielding information about cellular 
interception equipment from public disclosure.322 Whereas the cellular 
vulnerabilities of the 1990s were treated as a threat to the nation’s 
cellular network, today, DHS, whose stated mission includes protect-
ing critical infrastructure and information networks,323 also appears to 
have embraced the sensitive source and method narrative.324 
In 2013, acting FCC Chairwoman Mignon Clyburn stated, “Pro-
tecting consumer privacy is a key component of [the FCC’s] mission 
to serve the public interest.”325 Her predecessor, former FCC Chair-
man Julius Genachowski, similarly acknowledged that Congress had 
directed the Commission to “protect the privacy of consumers who 
rely on our Nation’s communications infrastructure.”326 Over the past 
two decades, however, the FCC appears to have done little other than 
accommodate and perpetuate the fictional secrecy narrative authored

attempt  to  satisfy  two,  sometimes  competing,  jurisdictional  man-
dates:332 enabling or engaging in surveillance on the one hand, while 
seeking to ensure the security of communications networks, on the 
other. These dual roles and objectives come into conflict, in theory 
and practice, when choices must be made to privilege either surveil-
lance or security. 
With respect to the dual surveillance and security responsibilities 
under the jurisdiction of these federal agencies, an uncritical adoption 
of the law enforcement narrative can suppress an equally compelling 
counter-narrative: Americans’ cellular communications are vulnerable 
to interception by foreign governments and criminals. We don’t know 
if or to what extent officials at the FCC or DHS have made an actual 
policy choice to privilege cellular interception over the security of 
cellular networks. Are officials, by withholding information about 
cellular interception technology, uncritically perpetuating the sensitive 
source and method narrative or, much worse, are they participating in 
a strategic choice to embrace this fiction? 
By viewing cellular interception equipment completely from a 
law enforcement agency perspective, policymakers and regulators are 
unlikely to address the underlying vulnerabilities in American cellular 
networks. To date, the government has made little effort publicly to 
address the cellular network vulnerabilities or to warn users about 
them. Meanwhile, the FCC and DHS have actively enabled the ongo-
ing exploitation of these vulnerabilities by U.S. government agencies. 
In response to a letter from Congressman Alan Grayson that cited 
an early online draft of this Article,333 FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler 
announced that the Commission has formed a task force to investigate 
“illicit  uses”  of  cellular  surveillance  technology.  334  Congressman 
Grayson’s letter and Chairman Wheeler’s announcement are the first 
direct, public statements by current U.S. government officials ac-
knowledging the privacy and national security threats posed by cellu-
lar interception technology.

the cellular network systemically from similar unlawful intrusions and interceptions.”). 
 No. 1]  Your Secret StingRay’s No Secret Anymore  63 
 
While the FCC’s task force is perhaps a positive first step, to the 
extent that it focuses only on the illicit uses of the surveillance tech-
nology without addressing the underlying network vulnerabilities ex-
ploited  by  IMSI  catchers,  it  will  do  little  to  address  the  real 
cybersecurity threat.335 To address these network vulnerabilities, how-
ever, because all parties’ surveillance technology exploit the same 
network vulnerabilities, policymakers will have to grapple with the 
tension inherent in facilitating “lawful” IMSI catcher use by law en-
forcement and prohibiting unlawful use by a host of bad actors. That 
is, there is no way to allow law enforcement to use cellular surveil-
lance devices without also leaving networks vulnerable to criminals 
and foreign governments. 
If the existence and knowledge of these vulnerabilities were truly 
a secret, and the technology that exploits them were only available to 
U.S.  government  agencies,  privileging  law  enforcement  equities 
might be a reasonable policy choice. Such a choice would only be 
warranted,  however,  if  law  enforcement  surveillance  capabilities 
could be protected without placing the American public at risk. But as 
this Article has illustrated, this scenario does not describe reality. 
IMSI catcher secrecy is a fairytale, while the long-term impact of 
the technology may lead to a privacy and security nightmare. Indeed, 
many of the security flaws exploited by cellular surveillance devices 
were publicly documented by academic security researchers a decade 
ago.336 In the years since, numerous foreign governments have ac-
quired surveillance devices that exploit those same vulnerabilities.337 
Moreover, they are readily available to technologically sophisticated 
criminals, private investigators, and the paparazzi. Meanwhile, law-
abiding citizens and businesses remain in a government-willed dark-
ness on the matter, exposed to a myriad of interception risks. 
If policymakers understood cellular network vulnerabilities and 
treated them as part of the existing debate about cybersecurity, in-
formed public discourse about the balance of risks and rights could 
begin. The cybersecurity debate and the rightful place of cellular net-
work security in that discourse are addressed next.

Although most of the cybersecurity concerns expressed by gov-
ernment leaders pertain to the security of government networks and so 
called “critical infrastructure,”345 such as the electronic power grid 
and the computer systems controlling power plants, America’s tele-
phone networks have not completely escaped the attention of policy-
makers. Sparked by fears that Chinese communications equipment 
companies, such as Huawei and ZTE, may have hidden surveillance 
backdoors in their products at the request of the Chinese govern-
ment,346 the U.S. national security establishment responded.347 Ac-
cording to media reports, both AT&T and Sprint, which had planned 
to purchase Huawei equipment for their next-generation 4G networks, 
were threatened by senior officials in the national security community 
with a consequent loss of government business and the disruption of 
merger plans.348 Ultimately, both companies did not purchase Huawei 
equipment, instead opting for network hardware from Western manu-
facturers.349

The House Intelligence Committee also investigated the matter, 
holding a hearing where executives from both Huawei and ZTE testi-
fied. In his opening remarks at that hearing, Committee Chairman 
Mike Rogers stated that “Americans have to trust our telecommunica-
tions networks” and that “[w]hen vulnerabilities in the equipment . . . 
can be exploited by another country, it becomes a priority and a na-
tional security concern.”350 After the hearing, the Committee released 
a bi-partisan report accusing the companies of collaborating with the 
Chinese military.351 
Significantly, when faced with the possibility that U.S. telecom-
munications networks might be vulnerable to exploitation by the Chi-
nese government through security flaws or backdoors, Congress and 
members of the national security community swiftly examined the 
problem and took decisive action. In contrast to the resources directed 
at these Chinese supply chain threats, nothing approaching this kind 
of effort and focus has been channeled towards other existing security 
vulnerabilities in our cellular networks that can and are being exploit-
ed by the intelligence services of many countries. 
While there are a number of likely reasons why the perceived 
threat posed by Huawei and ZTE became such a high-profile issue for 
policymakers, it is worth noting that the “fix” to this problem was 
rather simple — pressuring major U.S. carriers such as AT&T and 
Sprint to purchase equipment from Western (thus “trusted”) suppliers. 
The companies that made the mistrusted products are Chinese and 
thus subject to ready and politically safe (indeed, politically reward-
ing) demonization by the intelligence community and their allies in 
Congress. Moreover, the national security threat posed by Chinese 
government exploitation of backdoors in Chinese telephony equip-
ment, unlike many other threats, offered the inherent political benefit 
of being legally amenable to public discussion without putting any 
U.S. government intelligence sources and methods at risk. 
In contrast to the Huawei and ZTE threat, the risks posed by the 
cellular network vulnerabilities described in this Article present a far 
more politically delicate problem. The technical fix for them may be

expensive and time-consuming,352 and the companies that have long 
known about these vulnerabilities in their networks, yet have neither 
fixed the vulnerabilities nor warned consumers about the risks, are 
large, politically active U.S. corporations. Moreover, the devices that 
exploit these vulnerabilities, which are manufactured by similarly 
large, politically active defense contractors, are considered sensitive 
sources and methods that U.S. law enforcement and intelligence agen-
cies would undoubtedly prefer not to be the subject of open discussion 
at public hearings. It is therefore not surprising that policymakers 
have failed to tackle this issue, whether in the context of the existing 
cybersecurity debate or otherwise. 
Now  that  Congress  and  the  FCC  have  slowly  started  to 
acknowledge the national security threats posed by cellular surveil-
lance technology, however, policymakers are likely to look for solu-
tions to the problem. We present and examine some possible solutions 
next. 
IX. PROTECTING OUR COMMUNICATIONS 
The cellular communications of billions of people around the 
world are vulnerable to interception by their own governments, other 
governments, and tech-savvy criminals. In spite of the determined 
efforts of the U.S. law enforcement community to suppress disclosure 
of information about these vulnerabilities and their exploitation by the 
government, some information has finally entered into public dis-
course. State legislatures are asking questions about StingRays,353 
members of Congress want to know about their own vulnerability to 
foreign government surveillance,354 and the FCC has even created a 
task force to study various cellular surveillance and cybersecurity 
threats.355 The endemic insecurity of U.S. cellular communications

networks is now front-page news. This increased attention from the 
media and policymakers is likely to result in action — whether in the 
form of legislation, regulation, or merely increased pressure on the 
cellular industry. 
By upgrading the security of their networks, the wireless carriers 
can protect their customers from some of the cellular interception 
technologies described in this Article. Such upgrades will be neither 
cheap nor easy to perform, given the significant size and reach of U.S. 
cellular networks.356 Alternatively, consumers’ communications could 
be protected by transitioning to more-secure, Internet-based voice and 
text communications services that work on top of cellular data and 
WiFi networks. Or, perhaps, consumers will start to use counter-
surveillance technologies capable of detecting nearby cellular surveil-
lance devices. While a thorough examination of the solutions and the 
regulatory process necessary to execute them is beyond the scope of 
this Article, this Part will examine a few likely technical avenues 
through which solutions could come. 
A. Securing Cellular Networks 
If the wireless carriers and the phones used by their customers ex-
clusively employed modern cellular encryption algorithms, some of 
the cellular interception vulnerabilities described in this Article would 
be cured. But the wireless industry has not switched to modern cryp-
tography. Wireless carriers continue to use weak algorithms that were 
designed in the 1980s and broken in the 1990s.357 Indeed, the outmod-
ed A5/1 algorithm remains the most widely deployed cellular encryp-
tion algorithm in the world.358 An improved encryption algorithm, 
A5/3, was developed and standardized by the cellular industry in 
2002. A5/3-capable hardware, however, was not built into cellular 
phones until 2009,359 and is still not currently used by many carri-
ers.360  The  decade-old  A5/3  algorithm,  however,  may  already  be 
                                                                                                                  
task-force has expanded its mission to cover other cellular network security flaws exploited 
by commercial surveillance technologies).

of people still rely on it.”).

showing its age, since it reportedly has already been broken by the 
NSA and its British counterpart.361  
Moreover, even though modern smartphones have the capability 
to communicate using modern, more secure protocols, they must also 
be able to complete calls and function over older cellular networks 
where older, weaker encryption is still in use. This necessity for 
backward compatibility is a source of persistent security vulnerabili-
ties. 
By upgrading the encryption algorithms used by existing second 
generation (“2G”) networks or by migrating entirely to more-secure 
third (“3G”) and fourth generation (“4G”) technologies, wireless car-
riers can protect their subscribers from the passive interception vul-
nerabilities described in Part V.B.362 Deutsche  elekom (“ -Mobile”), 
for example, has already upgraded its 2G cellular networks in Germa-
ny and four other European countries to A5/3, and has planned similar 
upgrades in other countries.363 T-Mobile (U.S.) has quietly begun the 
process of upgrading the security of its own network.364 AT&T has 
apparently opted for a different approach: Rather than upgrading the 
security of its 2G network, the company has instead committed to shut 
it down by 2017 in order to repurpose the spectrum for newer 3G and 
4G networks.365 Although A & ’s planned network migration is like-
ly motivated by consumer demand for high-speed data,366 it will also 
improve security, because 3G and 4G networks use newer, more se-
cure encryption algorithms.

Protecting telephone subscribers from active surveillance devices 
is far more difficult, if not practically impossible. Even when a wire-
less carrier has upgraded their entire network, the telephones used by 
their subscribers will still connect to networks that use older, insecure 
networking technology. This backward compatibility, which is a nec-
essary feature in all handsets because any phone might be taken by its 
owner to rural areas or foreign countries where older networks remain 
in use, is a vulnerability that can also be exploited for surveillance.367 
Indeed, many of the manufacturers of active surveillance openly ad-
vertise the ability to jam 3G and 4G networks in order to force tele-
phones to connect an active interception device masquerading as a 2G 
base station.368 
The ability to force modern phones to communicate insecurely is 
an unintended side effect of the need to maintain compatibility for 
older, insecure cellular network technologies. As long as phones con-
tinue to support older, insecure phone protocols, they can be manipu-
lated into using them, even in cities where all legitimate networks use 
3G and 4G technology. 
The migration away from 2G, which will be a slow and expensive 
process for the wireless carriers, will certainly improve the security of 
cellular networks, but many forms of unmediated surveillance will 
still be possible. While 3G and 4G networks employ much more se-
cure encryption algorithms that protect calls, text messages, and Inter-
net data from unauthorized interception, sophisticated 4G surveillance 
devices can still acquire the serial numbers of nearby phones and lo-
cate them. Indeed, several law enforcement agencies have already 
upgraded to the 4G capable Harris Hailstorm, which can locate and

that can be exploited in backward compatible phones. An active surveillance device can 
extract the cryptographic keys associated with particular targeted handsets. This crypto-
graphic key material can then be used to either decrypt call data that had been previously 
recorded and retained, or used in tandem with a passive interception device to perform real-
time interception in the future. See ABILITY COMPUTERS & SOFTWARE INDUS. LTD., supra

grates away from 2G, many other law enforcement agencies will re-
spond by upgrading from the 2G StingRay to the 4G Hailstorm. For 
the many state and local law enforcement agencies that presumably 
only use cellular surveillance devices to identify and track phones, not 
to intercept communications, the 4G migration will require the pur-
chase  of  new,  expensive  surveillance  equipment,  but  ultimately 
should not impact their technical surveillance capabilities. 
Moreover, while 4G surveillance devices are currently very ex-
pensive,370 they will, of course, become cheaper over time and easier 
for private parties to purchase, as with prior generations of surveil-
lance technology. Indeed, foreign companies are already openly ad-
vertising 4G surveillance products.371 As a result, even though the 
wireless carriers may eventually be able to protect their customers’ 
communications from unmediated interception, cell phones will likely 
remain vulnerable to remote identification and tracking, whether by 
law enforcement agencies, foreign intelligence services, or criminals. 
B. “Over-the-Top” Secure Communication Apps 
It is possible to deliver secure communications over an insecure 
network. The HTTPS encryption built into web browsers, which is 
used to secure data transmitted to and from websites, does just that, 
enabling someone safely to check her bank balance or to read her 
email on a public WiFi network where they would otherwise be vul-
nerable to WiFi interception.372 Just as the security of Bank of Ameri-
ca or Google’s websites does not depend on their customers’ using 
secure WiFi networks, so too can the audio and text communications 
of smartphone users be protected by apps that supply their own en-
cryption, even when the underlying cellular network remains vulnera-
ble to interception. 
Smartphone apps already exist, some with hundreds of millions of 
existing users,373 which use encryption to protect their users’ text,

378. For example, since 2011, Apple’s iOS operating system has used its own iMessage 
service for all text messages sent between iOS devices. Such text messages are, without 
requiring any configuration or special action by the user, encrypted and sent over the Inter-

Communications made using these apps cannot be intercepted us-
ing the surveillance devices discussed in this Article. Moreover, some 
services,  such  as  Apple’s  iMessage  and  Face ime,  Facebook’s 
WhatsApp, and a few other third-party apps that encrypt messages 
end-to-end, protect against interception not only by wireless carriers 
and, Internet Service Providers, but also by the companies that pro-
vide these apps.379 Indeed, end-to-end encryption technology protects 
the contents of user communications from interception by all but the 
most skilled actors.380 
Even so, most of these apps, particularly those made by the larg-
est technology companies, do not openly advertise the security ad-
vantages of their services. Instead, they typically compete on cost or 
ease of use. Once the ease with which cellular communications can be 
intercepted becomes known to more consumers, however, those com-
panies with widely used communications apps are well-placed to 
compete and deliver a more secure communications experience to 
consumers. 
C. Counter-Surveillance Technology 
The FBI, which acts as the national coordinator for law enforce-
ment use of cellular surveillance technology,381 has insisted that in-
formation  about  the  technology  must  be  kept  secret  to  avoid 
“provid[ing]  adversaries  with  critical  information . . .  necessary  to 
develop defensive technology, modify their behaviors and otherwise 
take countermeasures designed to thwart the use of this technolo-
gy.”382 It may be too late. Indeed, some of the biggest players in the 
cellular surveillance market have already sought patents, and thus 
filed public applications describing, in significant detail, techniques

WhatsApp’s new encryption scheme as “totally frictionless”). 
379. See We’ve Built Privacy into the Things You Use Every Day, supra note 375; 
Nakashima, supra note 377. 
380. Even when communications are encrypted, it is still possible for a determined ad-
versary (such as a law enforcement or intelligence agency) to intercept those communica-
tions. By infecting the end-point (such as a mobile phone or laptop used by one of the 
callers) with specially designed surveillance software, sophisticated actors can obtain unen-
crypted audio, video, and text communications from a target’s device. U.S. law enforcement 
and intelligence agencies already use such software. See Jennifer Valentino-DeVries & 
Danny Yadron, FBI Taps Hacker Tactics To Spy on Suspects, WALL ST. J. (Aug. 3, 2013),

that can detect active cellular surveillance devices.383 Although it is 
unlikely  that  these  companies  will  sell  their  counter-surveillance 
products to the general public, there are now a number of other ways 
for individuals to acquire software or devices capable of detecting 
cellular surveillance technology. 
Over the past several years, several academic researchers and 
boutique security companies have created their own “IMSI catcher 
catcher” counter-surveillance products. The first public project, which 
was released by researchers in 2011, was extremely difficult to use, 
requiring the user to replace the operating system on a widely availa-
ble $15 Motorola phone with custom software.384 According to the 
researchers who developed the software, IMSI catchers show different 
behavior from normal base stations to achieve their goals. The soft-
ware “distinguish[es] between yellow, red, and black flags. Yellow 
flags are an indication that you might have been caught; red flags are 
a very strong indication; and black flags tell you: ‘You are being 
tracked down; throw away your phone and run.’”385 A few years later, 
a different team of researchers released an Android app for the popu-
lar Samsung Galaxy S3 smartphone capable of detecting IMSI catch-
ers. In contrast to the earlier effort, use of this app did not require that 
the user replace their entire phone operating system.386 The app is 
available from Google’s App Store, and can be easily installed by 
anyone in just a few steps.387 
In spite of the FBI’s efforts, the tools and information necessary 
to detect cellular surveillance devices are now public. Academics 
have published peer-reviewed research describing novel techniques to 
detect cellular surveillance,388 MIT students in 2014, as a class pro-
ject, built their own counter-surveillance app,389 and boutique security

X. CONCLUSION 
This Article has illustrated how cellular interception capabilities 
and technology has become, for better or worse, globalized and de-
mocratized, placing Americans’ cellular communications at risk of 
interception by foreign governments, criminals, and the tabloid press, 
to mention a few. Notwithstanding this risk, U.S. government agen-
cies shroud almost every aspect of the StingRay and similar direct 
interception technology in secrecy, in an ostensible but futile effort to 
prevent criminals from learning how to thwart the technology. But 
this narrative, which disingenuously asserts a continuing need for se-
crecy regarding StingRay technology, does greater harm by inhibiting 
public awareness and discussion of the risks associated with private 
use of unmediated surveillance technologies, thus preventing policy-
makers from addressing the underlying vulnerabilities in cellular net-
works. Those who cling to the position that a demonstrably illusory 
veil of secrecy is essential to protect the utility of surveillance capabil-
ities, and who, as a consequence, suppress information necessary to a 
full public discussion of cellular network security, effectively under-
mine broader congressional efforts to strengthen cybersecurity.  This 
unnecessary and counterproductive veil must be lifted so that the pub-
lic and legislators can address the full scope of interception risks in a 
public policy process that will promote better, stronger cybersecurity 
practices.
